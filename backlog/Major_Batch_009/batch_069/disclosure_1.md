## Dynamic Haptic Template Overlay System

**Concept:** Extend the multi-channel communication system to incorporate haptic feedback on the patient device, allowing clinicians to remotely guide patients through physical examinations or therapeutic exercises by "drawing" on the patient’s skin via localized vibration.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware - Patient Device:**
    *   Integrated array of micro-actuators (vibrational/tactile elements) embedded within a flexible, biocompatible skin patch. Resolution: 1 cm spacing minimum, targeting 0.5cm.  Patch size adaptable (Small: 10x10cm, Medium: 20x20cm, Large: 30x30cm).
    *   Wireless communication module (Bluetooth 5.0 LE preferred) for receiving clinician commands.
    *   Power source: Rechargeable battery (minimum 4-hour operation).
    *   Skin adhesion: Medical-grade adhesive, hypoallergenic.
*   **Hardware - Clinician Device (Second Clinician Device):**
    *   High-resolution touchscreen display.
    *   Stylus with pressure sensitivity.
    *   Dedicated software interface (see Software Specifications).
*   **Software - Clinician Device:**
    *   Real-time anatomical template overlay: Displays a selectable anatomical template (e.g., musculoskeletal system, dermatomes) corresponding to the patient’s condition.
    *   Haptic drawing tool: Allows the clinician to “draw” on the anatomical template using the stylus.  Pressure sensitivity maps to haptic intensity on the patient device.
    *   Pattern library: Pre-programmed haptic patterns for common examination maneuvers (e.g., palpation sequences, range of motion guidance).
    *   Communication integration: Seamless integration with the existing multi-channel communication system (video/audio).
    *   Remote control: Ability to adjust haptic intensity, frequency, and pattern remotely.
*   **Software - Patient Device:**
    *   Haptic driver: Receives and interprets commands from the clinician device, activating the appropriate micro-actuators.
    *   Safety protocols:  Limits haptic intensity and frequency to prevent discomfort or skin irritation.
    *   Feedback mechanism: Optional visual or auditory feedback to indicate haptic activation.

**Pseudocode (Clinician Side):**

```
// Clinician selects patient
patientID = getPatientID()

//Clinician loads relevant anatomical template
template = loadTemplate(patientID.condition)

//Clinician draws on template with stylus
stylusPositionX = getStylusPositionX()
stylusPositionY = getStylusPositionY()
stylusPressure = getStylusPressure()

hapticIntensity = stylusPressure * scalingFactor

//Send haptic command to patient device
sendHapticCommand(patientID, stylusPositionX, stylusPositionY, hapticIntensity)

//Option: Load preset haptic pattern
pattern = loadPresetPattern(patientID.condition, maneuverType)
sendPatternToPatient(patientID, pattern)
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  Clinician establishes communication session with patient.
2.  Clinician selects or loads relevant anatomical template.
3.  Clinician initiates haptic guidance, either by freehand drawing or selecting a pre-programmed pattern.
4.  Patient feels localized vibrations corresponding to the clinician’s guidance.
5.  Clinician observes patient’s response via video feed and adjusts guidance accordingly.
