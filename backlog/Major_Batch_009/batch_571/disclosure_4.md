## Log Data ‘Shadowing’ with Predictive Re-Transmission

**Concept:** Enhance log data reliability and availability by creating ‘shadow’ copies of log subsets *before* transmission, utilizing predictive re-transmission based on network conditions and node health. This isn’t just about ensuring delivery – it’s about *anticipating* failure and having usable data immediately available.

**Specs:**

**1. Shadowing Module:**

*   **Function:** Responsible for creating and managing shadow copies of log subsets.
*   **Implementation:** Operates alongside the existing log agent. Receives log entries and, based on a configurable policy (see section 3), duplicates the entry into a shadow storage area *before* transmission.
*   **Storage:** Shadow storage can be local SSD, RAM disk, or a dedicated, highly available storage cluster.
*   **Metadata:** Each shadowed entry is tagged with:
    *   Original timestamp
    *   Subset ID (matching the main transmission)
    *   Shadow creation timestamp
    *   Transmission status (pending, in-flight, acknowledged, failed)
    *   Re-transmission counter

**2. Predictive Network Monitor:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors network conditions between the log agent and the processing node.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   Packet loss rate
    *   Latency (round trip time)
    *   Jitter
    *   Bandwidth availability
*   **Algorithm:** Employs a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict near-future network degradation.
*   **Output:** Risk score indicating the probability of transmission failure for the *next* log subset.

**3. Intelligent Re-Transmission Controller:**

*   **Function:** Orchestrates re-transmission based on network risk, node health, and shadow data availability.
*   **Logic:**
    *   **High Risk/Node Unhealthy:** Immediately initiate re-transmission from shadow storage *before* a timeout occurs.
    *   **Medium Risk:**  Pre-emptively re-transmit a portion of the shadow data (e.g., the most recent entries) as a ‘buffer’ against potential loss.
    *   **Low Risk:** Monitor transmission as usual.
    *   **Node Failure:** If the node goes down, the controller automatically serves the complete shadowed log subset from the storage area, minimizing data loss.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   **Shadowing Policy:**  Defines which log entries are shadowed (e.g., all entries, critical entries only, entries exceeding a certain size).
    *   **Risk Thresholds:** Configurable levels that trigger different re-transmission strategies.
    *   **Re-transmission Priority:**  Allows prioritizing specific log sources or types.

**Pseudocode (Re-transmission Controller):**

```
function handleLogSubset(subset, subsetId):
  shadowSubset(subset, subsetId) // Shadow the subset BEFORE transmission
  transmitSubset(subset, subsetId)

function monitorNetwork():
  riskScore = calculateRiskScore() // Based on network metrics
  return riskScore

function shadowSubset(subset, subsetId):
  storeSubsetInShadowStorage(subset, subsetId)
  log("Subset " + subsetId + " shadowed.")

function transmitSubset(subset, subsetId):
  if monitorNetwork() > riskThreshold:
    retransmitSubset(subset, subsetId) //Preemptive retransmission
  else:
    transmitSubsetNormally(subset, subsetId)

function retransmitSubset(subset, subsetId):
    log("Preemptive retransmission of subset " + subsetId + " initiated.")
    transmitSubsetNormally(subset, subsetId) //Treat as normal retransmit.
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Log Agent receives log entry.
2.  Shadowing Module duplicates entry to shadow storage.
3.  Log Agent transmits entry.
4.  Predictive Network Monitor analyzes network conditions.
5.  Intelligent Re-Transmission Controller decides whether to re-transmit from shadow storage.
6.  If re-transmission is necessary, data is served from shadow storage.
7.  Acknowledgement is sent from the processing node.
