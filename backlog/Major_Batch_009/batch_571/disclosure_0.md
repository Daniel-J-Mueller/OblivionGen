## Dynamic Contextual Keyword Generation via Temporal Analysis

**Concept:** Expand keyword identification beyond static web page analysis to incorporate temporal data—how search interest in related terms *changes* over time. This creates dynamically weighted keywords, improving ad relevance and ROI.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Input:** Initial item description (as in the patent).
*   **Process:** Queries multiple search engines (Google Trends, Bing Trends, etc.) for related search terms.
*   **Output:** Time series data for each related term (search volume over a defined period – e.g., last 12 months).

**2. Temporal Relevance Engine:**

*   **Input:** Time series data from Data Acquisition Module.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Trend Identification:** Applies algorithms (moving averages, exponential smoothing, ARIMA) to identify rising, falling, and stable trends for each related term.
    *   **Seasonality Detection:** Identifies recurring patterns (weekly, monthly, yearly) in search volume.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Flags unusual spikes or drops in search volume that may indicate emerging or fading trends.
    *   **Weighted Scoring:** Assigns a “Temporal Relevance Score” to each related term based on:
        *   **Trend Strength:**  Higher scores for rapidly rising trends.
        *   **Seasonality Amplitude:**  Higher scores for strong seasonal patterns.
        *   **Anomaly Significance:**  Higher scores for significant anomalies.
        *   **Recency:** Higher scores for recent trends.
*   **Output:**  List of related terms with associated Temporal Relevance Scores.

**3. Keyword Generation & Integration Module:**

*   **Input:** Initial keywords (from patent's process), list of related terms with Temporal Relevance Scores.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Weighted Combination:** Combines the original keyword scores (from the patent) with the Temporal Relevance Scores. A weighting factor (adjustable parameter) determines the relative importance of temporal data.
    *   **Dynamic Keyword List:**  Creates a prioritized keyword list based on the combined scores. Keywords with higher scores are given higher priority in ad targeting.
    *   **Automated A/B Testing:**  Continuously tests different keyword combinations (based on the dynamic list) to optimize ad performance.
*   **Output:** Prioritized keyword list for ad targeting, A/B test results.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Microservices:**  Each module implemented as a separate microservice.
*   **API Integration:**  APIs for communication between microservices and external data sources (search engines).
*   **Data Storage:**  Time series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) for storing temporal data.
*   **Cloud-Native:**  Designed for deployment on a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

**Pseudocode (Keyword Generation & Integration Module):**

```
FUNCTION generate_keywords(initial_keywords, temporal_keywords, weighting_factor):
  combined_keywords = []
  FOR keyword IN initial_keywords:
    score = keyword.score // From original patent's process
    temporal_score = 0
    IF keyword IN temporal_keywords:
      temporal_score = temporal_keywords[keyword].score
    combined_score = (score * (1 - weighting_factor)) + (temporal_score * weighting_factor)
    combined_keywords.append(Keyword(keyword, combined_score))

  // Add new keywords from temporal data (if not already present)
  FOR keyword, data IN temporal_keywords.items():
    IF keyword NOT IN [k.text FOR k IN combined_keywords]:
      combined_keywords.append(Keyword(keyword, data.score))

  // Sort keywords by combined score (descending)
  combined_keywords.sort(key=lambda x: x.score, reverse=True)

  RETURN combined_keywords
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Predictive Modeling:**  Use machine learning to predict future search trends and proactively adjust keywords.
*   **Geographic Segmentation:**  Analyze temporal trends on a geographic basis to target ads more effectively.
*   **Multi-Lingual Support:**  Extend the system to support multiple languages and analyze search trends in different regions.
