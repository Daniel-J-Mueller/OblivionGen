## Dynamic Graph Sharding with Predictive Access

**Specification:** A system for dynamically sharding the graph representation across multiple compute nodes, guided by predicted access patterns derived from user behavior and system load.

**Rationale:** The provided patent details an enterprise catalog service relying on a graph database for access control and search. A single graph, even with optimization, will eventually become a bottleneck. Static sharding schemes are inflexible. This specification outlines a system that *predicts* access needs and proactively reshards the graph, minimizing latency and maximizing throughput.

**Components:**

1.  **Access Pattern Analyzer:**
    *   Input: Logs of user queries, portfolio access, and listing views. System resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O) for each node.
    *   Process: Employs machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, recurrent neural networks) to predict future access patterns. Specifically, it identifies "hot" vertices and edges – those likely to be accessed frequently in the near future. Also predicts the *type* of query – e.g., "list products user X can access," "count products in portfolio Y."
    *   Output:  A "heat map" of the graph, indicating predicted access frequency for each vertex and edge, categorized by query type.

2.  **Dynamic Sharding Manager:**
    *   Input: Heat map from Access Pattern Analyzer, current graph shard assignments, node capacity.
    *   Process:  Utilizes a graph partitioning algorithm (e.g., METIS, ParMETIS, or a custom algorithm optimized for access patterns) to redistribute the graph across compute nodes. The goal is to:
        *   Place frequently accessed vertices and edges on the same node (co-location).
        *   Minimize cross-shard dependencies (reduce network traffic).
        *   Balance load across nodes.
        *   Prioritize shard assignments based on predicted query types. (e.g., if many "user access" queries are predicted, prioritize shard assignments that facilitate fast user-to-product lookups).
    *   Output:  A new shard assignment plan.

3.  **Shard Migration Engine:**
    *   Input:  Shard assignment plan, current graph state.
    *   Process:  Orchestrates the migration of graph data between nodes.  This could be implemented using a consistent hashing scheme to minimize data movement. Key techniques include:
        *   Incremental migration: Migrate data in small batches to minimize disruption.
        *   Read-through cache:  Serve requests from the cache during migration.
        *   Versioned data: Maintain multiple versions of the graph data to ensure consistency.
    *   Output: Updated graph shards on each compute node.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Sharding Manager):**

```
function calculate_shard_assignment(heatmap, current_shards, node_capacities):
  // Input: heatmap (predicted access frequency), current_shards, node_capacities

  new_shards = []
  unassigned_vertices = all vertices in graph

  for node in node_capacities:
    shard = {}
    capacity_used = 0

    //Greedily assign high-access vertices to this node until capacity is reached
    sorted_vertices = sort(unassigned_vertices, by access_frequency in heatmap)
    for vertex in sorted_vertices:
      if capacity_used + vertex.size < node.capacity:
        shard[vertex] = vertex.edges
        capacity_used += vertex.size
        unassigned_vertices.remove(vertex)

    new_shards.append(shard)

  //Handle remaining vertices by distributing them evenly
  for vertex in unassigned_vertices:
    node_index = vertex.id % len(new_shards) //Simple round-robin
    new_shards[node_index][vertex] = vertex.edges

  return new_shards
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Cache Invalidation:** Implement a robust cache invalidation mechanism to ensure that cached data is consistent with the sharded graph.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Design the system to handle node failures gracefully.  Replication and data partitioning can be used to ensure high availability.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  Continuously monitor system performance and adjust the machine learning models and sharding algorithms accordingly.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Account for the cost of data migration and storage when making sharding decisions.
