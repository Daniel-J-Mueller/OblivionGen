## Dynamic Presence Anchoring & Predictive Mobility

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple availability probabilities to create a dynamic "presence anchor" that predicts user movement and proactively adjusts presence information for services. This moves from *reactive* presence to *predictive* presence, enhancing service relevance and user experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Presence Event Data (as defined in the patent).
    *   GPS/Location Data (opt-in, granular control for user privacy).
    *   Calendar Data (opt-in, read-only access to appointments/meetings).
    *   Network Connectivity Data (Wi-Fi/Cellular signal strength, access point/tower IDs).
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope Data (device motion, indicating walking, driving, etc.).
*   **Presence Anchor Module:**
    *   **Historical Movement Modeling:**  Utilizes machine learning (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks) to build models of typical user movement patterns based on historical data.  These models predict likely locations given time of day, day of week, and ongoing activities (derived from calendar/activity data).
    *   **Real-Time Contextualization:** Combines historical models with real-time data (GPS, network, accelerometer) to refine location predictions and identify anomalies.
    *   **Probabilistic Location Zones:** Instead of a single "available" state, represent user presence as a probability distribution across geographic zones (e.g., "70% probability at home, 20% at office, 10% in transit").  Zones are dynamically adjusted based on predictive models.
*   **Service Integration Layer:**
    *   **Adaptive Presence Notifications:** Services receive not just availability probabilities, but *location-aware* probabilities.  A music streaming service, for example, could prioritize local playlists if the user is predicted to be at home.  A navigation app could proactively suggest routes based on predicted departure time.
    *   **Proactive Service Triggering:** Based on predicted movements, services can proactively prepare for user interactions.  A smart home system could pre-heat the house if the user is predicted to be arriving home soon.
    *   **Privacy Controls:**  Users have granular control over data sharing and can define "privacy zones" where presence information is suppressed.  They can also override predictions and manually set their status.
*   **Data Flow:**

    ```pseudocode
    // User Device
    loop:
        capturePresenceEvent()
        captureLocationData()
        captureCalendarData()
        captureNetworkData()
        captureMotionData()
        sendDataToServer()

    // Server Side - Presence Anchor Module
    function processData(eventData, locationData, calendarData, networkData, motionData):
        historicalModel = loadHistoricalModel(userId)
        predictedLocation = predictLocation(historicalModel, locationData, calendarData, networkData, motionData)
        zoneProbabilities = calculateZoneProbabilities(predictedLocation) // Assign probabilities to geographic zones
        updatePresenceInformation(userId, zoneProbabilities)

    // Service Request
    function requestPresenceInformation(userId, serviceId):
        presenceData = retrievePresenceInformation(userId) // Returns zoneProbabilities
        if serviceId has permission:
            return presenceData
        else:
            return "unavailable"
    ```

*   **Datastore:**
    *   User Profiles
    *   Historical Movement Data
    *   Historical Models
    *   Real-Time Presence Data (zoneProbabilities)
    *   Service Access Permissions

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/presence/update` -  For user devices to send presence event/location data.
    *   `/presence/request` -  For services to request presence information.
    *   `/presence/permissions` -  For managing service access permissions.
