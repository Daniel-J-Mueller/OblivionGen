## HSM-Based Predictive Key Rotation & Entropy Harvesting

**Concept:** Extend the HSM cluster's synchronization capabilities to proactively rotate cryptographic keys based on predicted usage patterns *and* harvest entropy from HSM internal processes to bolster key generation – simultaneously improving security and reducing reliance on external entropy sources.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Key Rotation Engine (PKRE):**

*   **Data Input:**  HSM access logs (timestamped key usage – encryption, decryption, signing, verification).  Application-level data indicating data sensitivity (e.g., “High Value Transaction,” “Personal Health Information”).  External threat intelligence feeds (optional).
*   **Analysis Module:**  Time series analysis (detecting usage spikes or anomalies). Machine learning models (trained on historical usage data) to predict future key usage.  Risk scoring module (combining usage predictions with data sensitivity and threat intelligence).
*   **Rotation Trigger:** Based on risk score exceeding a threshold, or predicted usage exceeding a capacity limit.  Rotation frequency adjustable per key, based on risk and usage.
*   **Rotation Procedure:** 
    *   PKRE initiates key pair generation within the HSM cluster. 
    *   New public key distributed to applications.
    *   A grace period allows for transition to the new key. 
    *   Old key archived (encrypted) within the HSM cluster, retained for auditing purposes, then eventually purged after verification of a 'clean' transition.
    *   Rotation events logged for auditing.

**2. Internal Entropy Harvesting (IEH):**

*   **Source Identification:** Monitor internal HSM processes that generate randomness – thermal noise within the chip, jitter in clock signals, variations in power consumption, true random number generator (TRNG) activity.
*   **Entropy Extraction:** Implement algorithms to capture and distill randomness from identified sources.  Apply statistical tests to verify entropy quality (e.g., NIST SP 800-22 tests).
*   **Entropy Pooling:**  Combine extracted entropy with existing TRNG output to create a larger entropy pool. Employ a robust entropy mixing function.
*   **Key Generation Integration:** Prioritize entropy from the internal pool for key generation processes. Monitor entropy pool health and trigger alerts if entropy levels fall below a minimum threshold.

**3. Cluster-Wide Synchronization & Management:**

*   **Enhanced Key Map:** Extend the existing key map to include predicted rotation dates, entropy source quality metrics, and key lineage information.
*   **Synchronization Protocol:** Modify the synchronization protocol to include the enhanced key map, ensuring all HSMs are aware of key rotation schedules and entropy source health.
*   **Automated Monitoring & Alerting:**  Implement a monitoring dashboard to visualize key usage patterns, entropy source health, and key rotation schedules.  Configure alerts for anomalies or potential security risks.

**Pseudocode (PKRE - Simplified):**

```
FUNCTION predict_key_rotation(key_name)
    data = get_key_usage_data(key_name)
    risk_score = calculate_risk_score(data)
    IF risk_score > threshold THEN
        generate_new_key_pair(key_name)
        distribute_new_public_key(key_name)
        schedule_key_switch(key_name, grace_period)
        log_rotation_event(key_name)
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION calculate_risk_score(usage_data)
    // Analyze usage patterns, data sensitivity, threat intel
    // Implement a weighted scoring system
    score = ...
    RETURN score
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Dedicated hardware for entropy extraction and monitoring may be required.
*   HSM firmware updates to support new entropy sources and monitoring capabilities.
*   Increased network bandwidth to handle enhanced key synchronization.
