## Automated Inventory Reconciliation & Predictive Restocking - 'Phantom Stock' Mitigation

**System Overview:** This system expands upon the item release/return locations by integrating predictive analytics to proactively identify and address 'phantom stock' – inventory discrepancies between physical counts and system records. It aims to not just *record* item movement, but *anticipate* and correct inaccuracies before they impact order fulfillment or require manual intervention.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Dynamic Zone Assignment:** The item release/return locations are subdivided into ‘dynamic zones.’ Each zone is assigned a ‘confidence score’ based on historical data (e.g., error rates for specific items, user tendencies, time of day). Zones with lower confidence scores trigger enhanced data capture & verification protocols.

2.  **Multi-Modal Data Capture:** Beyond cameras/RFID readers, integrate:
    *   **Weight Sensors (High Precision):**  Verify item weight against expected values. Discrepancies flag potential errors.
    *   **Dimensional Scanners:**  Confirm item dimensions. Useful for identifying incorrect items or damaged packaging.
    *   **Acoustic Sensors:** Capture sounds associated with item placement (e.g., a ‘thud’ might indicate a damaged item). Analyze sound signatures to assess item condition.

3.  **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:** 
    *   **Data Fusion:**  Combine data from all sensors (visual, weight, dimensional, acoustic) with user/item history.
    *   **Predictive Modeling:**  Train a model to predict expected sensor readings based on item type, user, location, & time. 
    *   **Anomaly Scoring:** Calculate an anomaly score for each item placement. Scores exceeding a threshold trigger immediate action.

4.  **Automated Reconciliation Workflow:**
    *   **Low Anomaly Score:**  Accept placement, update inventory.
    *   **Medium Anomaly Score:**  Trigger a ‘verification scan’ (requiring a secondary scan of the item’s barcode/RFID). Display prompt on a touchscreen: "Please verify item is correct".
    *   **High Anomaly Score:** Immediately flag item for ‘manual audit.’ Route user to a dedicated audit station with trained personnel. 

5.  **‘Shadow Inventory’ Tracking:**  Maintain a ‘shadow inventory’ – a real-time estimate of actual stock levels based on sensor data and anomaly detection. Compare shadow inventory to system inventory. Significant discrepancies trigger alerts to inventory management.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Core):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateAnomalyScore(item, user, location, sensorData)
  // sensorData is a dictionary containing weight, dimensions, image features, sound features
  
  // 1. Calculate Expected Sensor Values
  expectedWeight = PredictWeight(item, user, location)
  expectedDimensions = PredictDimensions(item, user, location)
  expectedImageFeatures = PredictImageFeatures(item, user, location)
  expectedSoundFeatures = PredictSoundFeatures(item, user, location)
  
  // 2. Calculate Deviation Scores for Each Sensor
  weightDeviation = ABS(sensorData.weight - expectedWeight)
  dimensionDeviation = CalculateDistance(sensorData.dimensions, expectedDimensions) //using appropriate distance metric
  imageDeviation = CalculateDistance(sensorData.imageFeatures, expectedImageFeatures)
  soundDeviation = CalculateDistance(sensorData.soundFeatures, expectedSoundFeatures)
  
  // 3. Weighted Sum of Deviations (Weights tuned via experimentation)
  anomalyScore = (0.4 * weightDeviation) + (0.3 * dimensionDeviation) + (0.2 * imageDeviation) + (0.1 * soundDeviation)
  
  RETURN anomalyScore
END FUNCTION
