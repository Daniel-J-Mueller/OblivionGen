## Dynamic Stack Composition via Predictive AI

**Concept:** Expand the static “stack” metaphor to a dynamically composed, AI-predicted presentation, moving beyond simple grid layouts and collapsed/revealed views.  Instead of *revealing* items within a column, *predict* what the user will want to see *next* and proactively compose a tailored stack.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A Predictive Stack Engine (PSE).
*   **Input:** User interaction data (selection history, dwell time, navigation patterns), item metadata (tags, descriptions, relationships), contextual data (time of day, location, current task - if available).
*   **PSE Functionality:**
    *   **Association Mapping:**  Build a dynamic graph representing associations between items based on metadata and user interaction.
    *   **Predictive Modeling:** Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer model to predict the next item(s) the user is likely to engage with.  This isn’t just “next in the list,” but “most relevant based on context.”
    *   **Stack Composition:** Dynamically create and prioritize “stacks” of items. A stack isn’t a column anymore; it’s a *weighted* collection of related items.
    *   **Visual Representation:**  Beyond a grid, visualize the stacks using a “radial” or “organic” layout. Items closer to the center represent higher predicted relevance. Stacks can “branch” and overlap, visually indicating relationships.  
*   **Interaction Model:**
    *   **"Flow" Navigation:**  Users don't "select" a stack. They "flow" between stacks based on predicted relevance.  A subtle animation guides the user’s attention to the next likely stack.
    *   **"Explore" Mode:**  Users can explicitly enter “Explore” mode to see *all* available items, but the system still visually emphasizes the predicted relevant items.
    *   **"Override" Mechanism:** Users can “pin” items or stacks to force them to remain visible or prioritize them in the prediction algorithm.
*   **Hardware/Software Requirements:**
    *   Moderate processing power for the AI model (could be partially offloaded to the cloud).
    *   Touchscreen or similar input device for fluid navigation.
    *   GPU acceleration recommended for faster AI inference.
*   **Pseudocode (PSE – Simplified):**

```
function predict_next_stack(user_interaction_data, item_metadata):
    // Build Association Graph
    association_graph = build_graph(item_metadata, user_interaction_data)

    // Predict using RNN/Transformer
    predicted_items = run_model(association_graph, user_interaction_data)

    // Rank and Filter (limit number of items per stack)
    ranked_items = rank_items(predicted_items)
    stack = filter_items(ranked_items, max_items_per_stack)

    return stack

function update_model(user_interaction_data):
    // Retrain/Fine-tune the AI model based on new user data
    train_model(user_interaction_data)
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond *reactive* navigation (selecting from a grid) to *proactive* content presentation.  The AI doesn’t just show you what’s available; it anticipates what you’ll *want* to see next, creating a more fluid and engaging experience.  The visual layout moves beyond the rigid grid metaphor to a more organic and intuitive presentation.
