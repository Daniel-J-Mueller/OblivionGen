## Dynamic Audio Scene Reconstruction & Messaging

**Concept:** Expand the core audio message extraction into a full dynamic audio scene reconstruction, enabling context-aware messaging and richer communication beyond simple voice messages.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-microphone array (minimum 4, optimally 8+) integrated into the voice communication device (phone, smart speaker, etc.).  High-fidelity ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) with a sampling rate of at least 96 kHz. Dedicated DSP (Digital Signal Processor) for real-time audio processing.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Spatial Audio Capture & Reconstruction:** Algorithms to capture audio from multiple directions, estimate sound source locations (speaker, background noise, music), and reconstruct a 3D audio scene.  Utilize beamforming, source localization algorithms (e.g., MUSIC, ESPRIT), and potentially acoustic ray tracing.
    *   **Scene Segmentation & Object Recognition:**  AI/ML models (CNNs, Transformers) trained to identify audio "objects" within the reconstructed scene – speech, music, environmental sounds (cars, birds, doors closing), etc. Categorize and label these objects with confidence scores.
    *   **Contextual Intent Analysis:** Expand NLP models to analyze not just *what* is being said, but *where* and *when* it's being said.  Combine textual intent (from ASR) with spatial/temporal context (from scene reconstruction).  For example, "Send a message to Sarah" spoken near a car engine might imply a message about ETA.
    *   **Dynamic Message Payload Generation:** Based on contextual intent, generate enriched message payloads. This could include:
        *   **Spatial Audio Clips:**  Include a short clip of the surrounding audio environment alongside the voice message – offering the recipient a sense of the sender’s location and situation.
        *   **Ambient Sound Annotation:** Automatically identify and tag prominent ambient sounds in the audio clip (e.g., "traffic noise," "cafe ambiance").
        *   **Event Triggered Messaging:** Automatically trigger messages based on detected audio events (e.g., "Alarm going off – check camera feed").
        *   **Contextual Summarization:**  Generate a short text summary of the audio scene alongside the voice message ("Sender is in a busy cafe").
    *   **Recipient-Adaptive Delivery:**  Adjust message delivery format based on recipient preferences and device capabilities.  For example:
        *   Spatial audio playback on compatible devices.
        *   Textual summaries on devices with limited audio support.
        *   Interactive audio/visual representations of the audio scene.

**Pseudocode (Contextual Intent Analysis):**

```
function analyzeIntent(audioInput, sceneData):
  textData = performASR(audioInput)
  intent = performNLP(textData)

  if intent == "send_message":
    target = extractTarget(textData)
    messagePayload = extractPayload(textData)

    location = sceneData.senderLocation
    ambientSounds = sceneData.ambientSounds

    if ambientSounds.contains("car_engine"):
      messagePayload = "On my way, ETA based on traffic"
    elif location.is_indoors and location.type == "cafe":
      messagePayload = "In a busy cafe, will call you back later"

  return intent, target, messagePayload
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simple voice messaging to create a richer, more contextual communication experience.  It’s not just about *what* is said, but *where* and *when* it’s said, allowing for more informative and engaging communication. The dynamic payload generation and recipient-adaptive delivery offer significant improvements over traditional voice messaging systems.
