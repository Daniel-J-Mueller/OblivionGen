## Dynamic Embedding Personalization via Affective State

**Concept:** Extend word embedding personalization beyond user profiles and component enablement to incorporate real-time affective state detection and adaptation. This builds on the normalization vector concept, but makes it *dynamic* and driven by inferred emotional context.

**Specs:**

1.  **Affective State Input:** Integrate a multimodal sensor suite (microphone for prosody, camera for facial expression, potentially wearable bio-sensors for heart rate variability/skin conductance) to capture user affective state. This data feeds into a real-time emotion recognition module (using pre-trained or fine-tuned models – e.g., classifying into Valance/Arousal/Dominance (VAD) or Ekman’s basic emotions).

2.  **Emotion-to-Vector Mapping:**  Define a mapping function (potentially a learned neural network) that translates detected emotional state into adjustments to the normalization vector. The goal is to subtly shift the embedding space to reflect the user's current mood. For example:
    *   High Arousal/Positive Valence -> Emphasize words associated with energy, enthusiasm, or action.
    *   Low Arousal/Negative Valence -> Emphasize words associated with calmness, empathy, or reassurance.
    *   Neutral State -> Maintain the baseline normalization vector.

3.  **Dynamic Normalization Pipeline:**  Modify the existing normalization vector application process as follows:
    ```pseudocode
    function apply_dynamic_normalization(base_embedding, user_profile_vector, component_vector, emotion_vector):
        # Weighted combination of vectors. Weights can be learned.
        combined_vector = (user_profile_weight * user_profile_vector) + (component_weight * component_vector) + (emotion_weight * emotion_vector)

        # Normalize the combined vector
        normalized_vector = normalize(combined_vector)

        # Apply the normalized vector to the base embedding
        dynamic_embedding = dot_product(base_embedding, normalized_vector)

        return dynamic_embedding
    ```

4.  **Contextual Embedding Blending:** In addition to the above, incorporate a mechanism to blend embeddings generated from different data sources (ASR, web text, typed input) with varying weights, dynamically adjusted based on both user emotion *and* the context of the interaction. E.g., If the user expresses frustration, give more weight to ASR embeddings (reflecting their *spoken* frustration) and less weight to web text (potentially providing irrelevant information).

5.  **Personalized Emotion Profiles:** Store historical emotion data paired with user interactions. Use this data to build a personalized emotion profile for each user, enabling the system to anticipate emotional shifts and proactively adjust embeddings.

6.  **Evaluation Metric:**  Beyond traditional NLU accuracy, evaluate the system using subjective metrics such as perceived empathy, user satisfaction, and emotional resonance.

**Potential Applications:**

*   More engaging and empathetic virtual assistants.
*   Adaptive tutoring systems that respond to student frustration or boredom.
*   Mental health applications that provide personalized support based on emotional state.
*   Enhanced customer service experiences.
