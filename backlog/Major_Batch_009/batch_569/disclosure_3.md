## Dynamic Review Weighting via Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Expand sentiment analysis beyond textual content to incorporate user behavioral data during review consumption. This will create a dynamic weighting system for reviews, highlighting those from users exhibiting engagement indicative of genuine consideration, rather than cursory reading or ‘gaming’ the system.

**Specs:**

**I. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Input:** Customer review text, user interaction data.
*   **User Interaction Data:** Track the following metrics via website/app instrumentation:
    *   *Scroll Depth:* Percentage of the review text viewed.
    *   *Time Spent Reading:* Total time the user spends viewing the review.
    *   *Mouse Movement/Touch Patterns:* Capture patterns indicating attentive reading (e.g., following lines of text) vs. erratic movement.
    *   *Zoom/Font Size Adjustments:*  Indicates effort to improve readability/engagement.
    *   *Highlighting/Annotation:* If supported, track highlighted text and user-generated annotations.
    *   *Review Selection Pattern:* Sequence in which reviews are viewed (random vs. focused on specific aspects).
*   **Data Storage:** Store raw interaction data and derived features in a time-series database.

**II. Feature Engineering Module:**

*   **Calculate Engagement Score:** Develop a weighted sum of the above features to create a single "Engagement Score" for each user-review interaction. Weightings will be determined via A/B testing and machine learning optimization.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify potentially fraudulent or bot-driven review consumption patterns.

**III. Sentiment Weighting Module:**

*   **Baseline Sentiment Analysis:** Utilize existing sentiment analysis tools to determine the initial sentiment score for each review.
*   **Dynamic Weighting:** Multiply the baseline sentiment score by the user's Engagement Score. This amplifies the influence of reviews consumed by engaged users and diminishes the influence of those consumed by disengaged users.
*   **Normalization:** Normalize the weighted sentiment scores to ensure a consistent scale for display.

**IV. Display & Filtering Module:**

*   **Weighted Ranking:** Rank reviews based on the weighted sentiment score.
*   **Filtering Options:** Allow users to filter reviews based on engagement level (e.g., “Show only reviews from highly engaged users”).
*   **Visual Indicators:** Display visual cues (e.g., icons, color-coding) to indicate the engagement level of each review’s author.
*   **Adaptive UI:** Adjust the UI to prioritize the display of highly weighted reviews.

**Pseudocode (Sentiment Weighting):**

```
FUNCTION calculate_weighted_sentiment(review_text, user_interaction_data):
  baseline_sentiment = analyze_sentiment(review_text) // Existing sentiment analysis
  engagement_score = calculate_engagement_score(user_interaction_data)
  weighted_sentiment = baseline_sentiment * engagement_score
  normalized_sentiment = normalize(weighted_sentiment)
  RETURN normalized_sentiment
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Personalized Weighting:**  Adjust weighting factors based on user preferences and past behavior.
*   **Real-time Adjustment:**  Update weighting in real-time as the user interacts with the review.
*   **Integration with Trust Signals:** Incorporate other trust signals (e.g., verified purchase, reviewer reputation) into the weighting algorithm.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** Implement a robust A/B testing framework to continuously optimize weighting parameters and UI elements.
