## Adaptive Memory Partitioning with Predictive Compression

**Concept:** Extend the compression triggered by backgrounding an application to include *predictive* partitioning of memory based on application behavior, proactively compressing sections *before* transitioning to the background, and dynamically adjusting partition sizes based on usage patterns.

**Specification:**

**1. Behavioral Profiler Module:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitor application memory access patterns. Track read/write frequency, data locality, and data type distribution within allocated memory segments.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `MemorySegment` : { `startAddress`, `endAddress`, `accessCount`, `dataType`, `localityScore` }
    *   `ApplicationProfile` : { `applicationID`, `memorySegments[]`, `compressionHistory[]` }
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Periodically sample memory access events (hardware performance counters, memory management unit hooks).
    2.  Aggregate access counts per `MemorySegment` within the application's address space.
    3.  Calculate `localityScore` based on spatial/temporal proximity of access events. High score = frequently accessed together.
    4.  Update `ApplicationProfile` with observed data.

**2. Predictive Compression Engine:**

*   **Function:** Analyze `ApplicationProfile` data to identify memory segments suitable for proactive compression.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  For each `MemorySegment` in `ApplicationProfile`:
        *   Calculate a “Compression Suitability Score” based on:
            *   `accessCount` (low access = high score)
            *   `localityScore` (low locality = high score – compressing unrelated data is less impactful)
            *   `dataType` (compressible types – images, text – increase score)
        *   If `Compression Suitability Score` exceeds a threshold:
            *   Initiate compression of the segment *before* the application transitions to the background.
            *   Store the original virtual memory address and the compressed data location.
            *   Update `ApplicationProfile` with compression details.

**3. Dynamic Partition Manager:**

*   **Function:** Adjust memory partition sizes based on observed application behavior and compression status.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Monitor application memory allocations and deallocations.
    2.  Track the ratio of compressed vs. uncompressed memory.
    3.  If a significant portion of memory is compressed, *reduce* the initial allocated size for the application when it restarts (or resumes from the background).
    4.  If compression efficiency is low (e.g., frequently accessed data being compressed), *increase* the allocated size to avoid excessive decompression overhead.

**4.  Compression Scheme Integration:**

*   Utilize a tiered compression approach.
    *   Fast, lightweight compression (LZ4, Snappy) for frequently changing data.
    *   High-ratio compression (Zstd, Brotli) for static or rarely accessed data.
*   The `Compression Suitability Score` dictates the compression level.

**Pseudocode (within the Predictive Compression Engine):**

```
function predictCompression(applicationProfile) {
  for each segment in applicationProfile.memorySegments {
    suitabilityScore = calculateSuitabilityScore(segment)
    if (suitabilityScore > threshold) {
      compressedData = compress(segment.data, getCompressionLevel(suitabilityScore))
      storeCompressedData(compressedData, segment.startAddress)
      segment.isCompressed = true
      logCompressionEvent(applicationProfile.applicationID, segment.startAddress)
    }
  }
}

function calculateSuitabilityScore(segment) {
  score = 0
  score += (1.0 - (segment.accessCount / maxAccessCount)) * weightAccessCount
  score += (1.0 - (segment.localityScore / maxLocalityScore)) * weightLocality
  score += (dataTypeScore(segment.dataType)) * weightDataType
  return score
}
```

This system aims to go beyond simple background compression by proactively managing memory usage based on application-specific behavior, potentially leading to a more efficient use of resources and improved system performance.
