## Aerial Swarm Predictive Collision Avoidance with Simulated Physics

**System Overview:** A distributed system utilizing a swarm of aerial vehicles equipped with high-resolution imaging, precise location/pose sensors, and onboard processing capable of running real-time physics simulations. The system aims to *predict* potential collisions with objects (static or moving) *before* they become critical, enabling smoother, more efficient avoidance maneuvers. This moves beyond reactive avoidance to proactive maneuvering.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Aerial Vehicle:** Quadcopter/Hexacopter with minimum 1 hour flight time, capable of carrying payload of 2kg.
*   **Imaging System:** High-resolution RGB-D camera (minimum 1080p, depth accuracy < 5cm).
*   **Location/Pose Sensing:** Integrated GPS/IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) with RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) correction for centimeter-level accuracy. Optional: Lidar for enhanced environment mapping.
*   **Onboard Processor:** High-performance embedded system (Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin or equivalent) with dedicated GPU for physics simulation and image processing.
*   **Communication:** Secure, low-latency wireless communication (e.g., 802.11ax/Wi-Fi 6) for inter-vehicle communication and ground station connectivity.

**Software Specifications:**

1.  **Local Environment Mapping:** Each aerial vehicle constructs a dynamic 3D map of its immediate surroundings using data from its RGB-D camera and other sensors. This map includes identified objects (size, shape, velocity if applicable) and their estimated trajectories. Point cloud processing algorithms (e.g., OctoMap) are employed.
2.  **Physics Simulation Engine:** A lightweight, real-time physics engine (e.g., Bullet Physics Library, or custom engine optimized for aerial dynamics) runs *locally* on each vehicle.  Each vehicle simulates the predicted trajectory of itself and nearby objects *within its local map*. This isn't a global simulation; each vehicle has a limited ‘simulation volume’ around itself.
3.  **Collision Prediction:** The physics engine predicts potential collisions between the simulating vehicle and other objects within the simulation volume. A 'time-to-collision' (TTC) metric is calculated for each potential collision.
4.  **Trajectory Generation & Planning:**  If a collision is predicted with TTC below a threshold, a local trajectory planner generates an alternative flight path that avoids the collision. This is done *proactively*, before the collision becomes imminent. A Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm, modified for dynamic obstacle avoidance, can be employed.
5.  **Swarm Coordination:**  Vehicles share predicted collision risks and planned avoidance maneuvers with nearby vehicles using a localized communication network. This prevents 'cascading avoidance' – where one vehicle’s avoidance maneuver triggers another vehicle to avoid *its* maneuver. A distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft) is used for reliable communication.
6.  **Behavioral Arbitration:** Each vehicle has an arbitration module to weigh competing objectives, such as mission goals, energy efficiency, and collision avoidance. This module determines the optimal course of action based on the current situation.
7. **Simulated Object Injection**: The system will inject simulated objects into the environment for testing collision avoidance, this system can predict the consequences of unpredictable events which may occur in the real world.

**Pseudocode (Collision Prediction & Avoidance):**

```
For each time step:
    Update local 3D map with sensor data
    Run physics simulation within local volume
    For each predicted collision:
        If (time_to_collision < threshold):
            Generate avoidance trajectory using RRT
            If (trajectory is feasible):
                Broadcast planned maneuver to nearby vehicles
                Execute avoidance trajectory
            Else:
                Initiate emergency braking/hover
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Local Physics Simulation:**  Shifting the collision prediction from purely geometric calculations to physics-based simulations allows for more accurate prediction of complex interactions, particularly with moving objects.
*   **Distributed Simulation:**  By distributing the simulation workload across the swarm, the system reduces computational burden on any single vehicle and improves scalability.
*   **Proactive Avoidance:** Predicting collisions before they become critical allows for smoother, more efficient avoidance maneuvers, reducing energy consumption and improving mission performance.
* **Simulated Object Injection**: Allows for consistent training and testing with a known risk profile.
