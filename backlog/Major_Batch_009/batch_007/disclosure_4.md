## Adaptive Quorum Shaping via Predictive Failure Analysis

**Specification:** A system and method for dynamically adjusting quorum configurations based on predictive failure analysis of individual nodes within a distributed system. This builds upon the hybrid quorum concept by *proactively* shifting quorum weights *before* failures occur, rather than reacting to them.

**Components:**

*   **Failure Prediction Engine (FPE):** A machine learning model trained on node telemetry data (CPU load, memory usage, disk I/O, network latency, error rates, historical failure data). The FPE outputs a ‘Failure Risk Score’ (FRS) for each node, ranging from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).
*   **Quorum Weighting Manager (QWM):**  Responsible for adjusting the weight of each node within each quorum set based on its FRS.
*   **Dynamic Quorum Configuration (DQC):** The resultant configuration of quorum sets, with nodes weighted according to their FRS.
*   **Monitoring & Feedback Loop:** Continuous monitoring of node health and system performance, feeding data back into the FPE for model refinement.

**Operation:**

1.  **Telemetry Collection:**  Nodes continuously stream telemetry data to the FPE.
2.  **Failure Risk Scoring:** The FPE processes the telemetry data and calculates the FRS for each node.
3.  **Weight Adjustment:** The QWM uses the FRS to adjust the weight of each node within the defined quorum sets.  Nodes with higher FRS receive lower weights; nodes with lower FRS receive higher weights. The weights are normalized to maintain the total quorum size. (e.g., A node with FRS of 0.8 might have its weight reduced by 40%.)
4.  **DQC Implementation:**  The DQC applies the weighted quorum configuration to all read and write operations.  
5.  **Operation Execution:** Read/Write requests proceed as usual, but quorum decisions are now weighted towards healthier nodes.
6.  **Feedback & Refinement:** System performance and actual node failures are monitored. This data is fed back into the FPE to retrain the model and improve its predictive accuracy.

**Pseudocode (QWM Weight Adjustment):**

```
function adjust_weights(node_list, frs_list, base_weight):
  weighted_node_list = []
  total_weight = 0

  for i in range(len(node_list)):
    node = node_list[i]
    frs = frs_list[i]

    // Weight reduction factor (linear scaling for simplicity)
    weight_reduction = frs * 0.5  // Reduce weight by up to 50% based on FRS

    adjusted_weight = base_weight * (1 - weight_reduction)
    adjusted_weight = max(adjusted_weight, 0.01) // Ensure minimum weight

    weighted_node_list.append((node, adjusted_weight))
    total_weight += adjusted_weight

  // Normalize weights to sum to 1
  normalized_weighted_node_list = []
  for node, weight in weighted_node_node_list:
    normalized_weight = weight / total_weight
    normalized_weighted_node_list.append((node, normalized_weight))

  return normalized_weighted_node_list
```

**Novelty:**  Current hybrid quorum implementations are largely static, defined *before* deployment. This system proactively adapts to changing node health, increasing resilience and reducing the impact of failures *before* they happen. It introduces a dynamic weighting mechanism based on predictive failure analysis, rather than simply reacting to failures. This shifts the paradigm from reactive fault tolerance to proactive resilience.
