## Dynamic Tag Inheritance & Contextual Drift

**Concept:** Extend the freeform tagging system to allow for *tag inheritance* based on resource relationships *and* introduce a mechanism for tags to subtly *drift* in meaning over time, reflecting evolving security contexts.

**Specification:**

**1. Resource Graph:**

*   Maintain a directed graph representing resource relationships. Nodes are computing resources (VMs, databases, etc.). Edges represent dependencies (e.g., VM depends on database, application utilizes VM).
*   Edge types: `DEPENDS_ON`, `UTILIZES`, `HOSTS`, `CONTAINS`.  (extensible).
*   Graph is updated automatically by system monitoring and user-defined relationships.

**2. Tag Inheritance Rules:**

*   Define rules specifying how tags propagate through the resource graph.  Example:
    *   `IF resource A has tag "SECURITY_LEVEL=HIGH" AND resource B DEPENDS_ON resource A THEN resource B AUTOMATICALLY receives tag "INHERITED_SECURITY_LEVEL=HIGH"`.
    *   `IF resource A has tag "COMPLIANCE=PCI" AND resource B UTILIZES resource A THEN resource B receives tag "AFFECTED_BY_PCI"`.
*   Rules are prioritized.  Conflicts are resolved based on priority or a configurable strategy (e.g., last-applied wins).
*   Inherited tags are distinguishable from directly assigned tags (e.g., prefix or flag).

**3. Contextual Drift Mechanism:**

*   **Drift Vectors:** Each tag has an associated “drift vector” – a small, configurable adjustment applied to the tag’s value over time.
*   **Drift Triggers:**  Drift is triggered by contextual events:
    *   **Time-based:**  Tags slowly drift over time (e.g., a `SECURITY_LEVEL=HIGH` tag might subtly shift towards `SECURITY_LEVEL=MEDIUM_HIGH` after 6 months).
    *   **Event-based:**  Drift is triggered by security incidents, vulnerability disclosures, or compliance updates. (e.g., vulnerability discovered in a component used by a resource – tags related to that resource drift towards a lower security level).
    *   **Usage-based:** Drift based on access patterns and data sensitivity. (e.g. a tag can "decay" if it isn't actively used, suggesting it may no longer be applicable)
*   **Drift Magnitude:** Configurable per tag or tag type. Smaller magnitudes for critical tags, larger for informational tags.
*   **Drift Resolution:** When a tag’s drifted value crosses a threshold, an alert is generated, and a remediation workflow is initiated.

**4. Policy Engine Integration:**

*   Policy engine evaluates tags, including drifted values, to determine access control decisions.
*   Policy rules can explicitly consider tag drift – e.g., “Deny access if `SECURITY_LEVEL` is below `MEDIUM` *and* has drifted more than 10% in the last month.”

**Pseudocode (Policy Engine):**

```
function evaluatePolicy(user, resource, operation):
  tags = getTags(resource)
  driftedTags = calculateDrift(tags)
  relevantPolicies = getPolicies(user, operation)

  for policy in relevantPolicies:
    if policy.matches(driftedTags):
      return policy.action // ALLOW or DENY
  return DENY // Default deny
```

**Pseudocode (Drift Calculation):**

```
function calculateDrift(tags):
  driftedTags = {}
  for tag in tags:
    driftVector = getDriftVector(tag)
    driftedValue = applyDrift(tag.value, driftVector)
    driftedTags[tag.key] = driftedValue
  return driftedTags
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   More dynamic and adaptable security posture.
*   Automated response to changing threats and compliance requirements.
*   Reduced administrative overhead.
*   Enhanced visibility into security drift.
