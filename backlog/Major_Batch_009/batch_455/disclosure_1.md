## Dynamic Payload Distribution System - Integrated with Airbag Lift

**Concept:** Integrate a dynamic payload distribution system with the airbag lift mechanism to actively shift the center of gravity during lifting and maneuvering. This enhances stability, allows for lifting unevenly weighted loads, and enables precise platform orientation.

**Specs:**

*   **Platform Modification:** Integrate a multi-axis robotic arm (6-DOF minimum) onto the platform. Payload capacity of the arm should match or exceed expected maximum payload variance.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU): High-precision IMU mounted on the platform to continuously monitor platform orientation and acceleration.
    *   Load Cells: Distributed load cells beneath the platform bed to map payload weight distribution in real-time.
    *   Vision System: Stereoscopic camera system to visually identify payload shape and center of mass (supplementing load cell data).
*   **Control System:**
    *   Processor: Industrial-grade, real-time processor with sufficient computational power for sensor fusion, dynamic modeling, and control algorithms.
    *   Software:
        *   Sensor Fusion Algorithm: Kalman filter or similar to combine data from IMU, load cells, and vision system.
        *   Dynamic Model: Physics-based model of the platform, payload, and airbag system.
        *   Control Algorithm: Model Predictive Control (MPC) or similar advanced control algorithm to optimize robotic arm movements and airbag pressure adjustments.
*   **Robotic Arm Integration:**
    *   End Effector: Customizable end effector to accommodate various payload types.
    *   Range of Motion: Sufficient range of motion to counteract anticipated payload imbalances.
    *   Actuation: High-precision, fast-response actuators.
*   **Airbag System Modification:**
    *   Segmented Airbags: Divide the airbag column into independently controllable segments (at least three).
    *   Pressure Regulation: Precise pressure regulators for each airbag segment.
    *   Communication: Bi-directional communication between control system and pressure regulators.

```
LOOP:
    1.  Read Sensor Data: IMU, Load Cells, Vision System.
    2.  Estimate Payload Center of Gravity (CoG).
    3.  Calculate Desired CoG Offset.
    4.  Calculate Robotic Arm Movements to Achieve Desired CoG Offset.
    5.  Calculate Airbag Pressure Adjustments for Stabilization.
    6.  Send Commands to Robotic Arm and Airbag Pressure Regulators.
    7.  Monitor System Stability.
    8.  Adjust Control Parameters as Needed.
    9.  Repeat from Step 1.
```

**Operational Modes:**

*   **Automatic Stabilization:** System automatically maintains platform stability during lifting and maneuvering.
*   **Precise Positioning:** User specifies desired platform orientation, and the system adjusts the robotic arm and airbag pressure to achieve it.
*   **Uneven Load Compensation:** System actively compensates for unevenly distributed payloads.
*   **Emergency Recovery:** In the event of a system failure, the robotic arm can be used to stabilize the platform and prevent a collapse.
