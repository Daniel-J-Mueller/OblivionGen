## Decentralized Key Rotation with Proof-of-Usage

**Specification:** A system for managing data encryption keys where key rotation isn't centrally dictated, but triggered by verifiable message volume associated with a specific key. This moves beyond time-based or message-count-based rotation to a system tied to *actual* key usage, enhancing security and reducing unnecessary re-encryption.

**Components:**

*   **Usage Oracle:** A distributed network (e.g., blockchain-based) responsible for recording verifiable "proof of usage" for each data encryption key. This isn't simply tracking message count, but a cryptographic attestation that a key was demonstrably used to encrypt a message.
*   **Key Registry:** A service storing the current data encryption keys and associated metadata (creation time, last usage time, rotation threshold, associated Usage Oracle address).
*   **Message Handler Enhancement:** Modifications to existing message handlers to generate a “Usage Proof” alongside message encryption.
*   **Rotation Daemon:** A background service monitoring the Usage Oracle for key rotation signals.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Key Generation:** A new data encryption key is generated by the Key Management Service and registered with the Key Registry.  The Registry sets a “rotation threshold” – the verifiable message volume (expressed as a cryptographic signature count) that triggers key rotation.  The Registry also records the address of the relevant Usage Oracle instance.
2.  **Message Encryption:** When a message is encrypted, the Message Handler generates a cryptographic “Usage Proof” linked to the key used. This proof is essentially a digitally signed attestation of key usage.
3.  **Usage Proof Submission:** The Message Handler submits the Usage Proof to the designated Usage Oracle. The Oracle verifies the proof's validity and records a single “usage count” for that key.  (The oracle design must prevent double-counting and Sybil attacks.)
4.  **Rotation Monitoring:** The Rotation Daemon periodically queries the Usage Oracle for each key’s accumulated usage count.
5.  **Key Rotation Trigger:** When a key's usage count exceeds its pre-defined rotation threshold, the Rotation Daemon instructs the Key Management Service to generate a new key. The old key is marked for deactivation.
6.  **Graceful Transition:**  A period is allowed for messages to be re-encrypted with the new key. During this period, both the old and new keys are accepted for decryption.

**Pseudocode (Rotation Daemon):**

```
LOOP:
  FOR EACH key IN KeyRegistry:
    usageCount = Query(UsageOracle, key)
    IF usageCount >= key.rotationThreshold:
      newKey = GenerateNewKey(KeyManagementService)
      MarkOldKeyForDeactivation(KeyRegistry, key)
      SetNewKeyAsActive(KeyRegistry, newKey)
      Log("Key rotated: " + key + " -> " + newKey)

  SLEEP(60 seconds)
END LOOP
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Adaptive Security:** Key rotation is triggered by *actual* usage, offering more responsive security than fixed schedules.  Low-traffic keys rotate less frequently, reducing overhead. High-traffic keys rotate more frequently, increasing security.
*   **Decentralized Control:** The Usage Oracle introduces a degree of decentralization, preventing a single point of failure or control.
*   **Auditable Usage:** The Usage Oracle provides a verifiable record of key usage, useful for auditing and compliance.
*   **Reduced Re-Encryption:**  Minimizes unnecessary re-encryption by only rotating keys when demonstrably warranted.
