## Dynamic Resonance Profiling for Internal Object State

**Concept:** Expand the conveyor-based sensing to not just *detect* characteristics, but to actively *probe* the internal state of objects via induced resonance.

**Specs:**

*   **Resonance Actuation:** Integrate localized, variable-frequency actuators (piezoelectric, electromagnetic, or ultrasonic transducers) *into* the conveyor surface at strategic points. These actuators will induce controlled vibrations within the conveyed object.
*   **High-Resolution Sensor Array:**  Deploy a dense array of micro-sensors (accelerometers, strain gauges, optical sensors) *alongside* the actuators, directly measuring the object’s vibrational response.  Sensor placement is critical—densely packed near actuator points and spread across likely ‘resonance nodes’ based on object geometry (estimated or pre-programmed).
*   **Frequency Sweep & Mode Mapping:**  The control system will execute a dynamic frequency sweep, varying the actuator frequency while monitoring sensor data.  This will create a ‘resonance profile’ – a map of frequencies at which the object exhibits maximum vibrational amplitude, and the corresponding vibrational *modes* (patterns of motion).
*   **Internal Structure Inference Engine:** Develop a machine learning model trained to correlate resonance profiles with known internal structures and states.  This engine will analyze the sensor data to infer:
    *   **Fill Level:** For containers – how full is it?
    *   **Internal Component Integrity:** Detect broken or shifted internal parts.
    *   **Liquid Slosh/Settling:**  Monitor liquid movement *inside* opaque containers.
    *   **Density Variations:** Identify areas of differing density within a solid object.
*   **Adaptive Excitation:** Implement an algorithm that adapts the excitation frequency and amplitude based on real-time sensor feedback. This ensures optimal resonance and minimizes energy waste.  If a certain frequency consistently yields strong responses, the system will focus on that range.
*   **Multi-Object Differentiation:**  Advanced signal processing to isolate the resonant signature of each individual object on the conveyor, even when they are touching.  Phase cancellation/enhancement techniques may be necessary.
*   **Data Visualization:** Create a 3D visualization of the object’s resonance modes, highlighting areas of high vibration and potential internal issues.

**Pseudocode (Resonance Profiling Routine):**

```
FUNCTION PerformResonanceProfiling(object):
    Initialize actuators and sensors
    Start frequency sweep (min_freq to max_freq)

    WHILE frequency < max_freq:
        Set actuator frequency to current frequency
        Record sensor data
        Calculate resonance amplitude
        Store resonance amplitude with corresponding frequency
        Increment frequency
    END

    Calculate resonance profile from stored data
    Train/Apply ML model to interpret resonance profile
    Infer internal object state
    Return inferred state
END
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Quality control of packaged goods (detecting missing components, improper filling)
*   Non-destructive testing of fragile items
*   Security screening (detecting concealed objects)
*   Automated sorting based on internal content or state.
