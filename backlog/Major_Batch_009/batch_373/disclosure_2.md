## Dynamic Contact Orchestration via Predictive Sentiment & Channel Prioritization

**System Overview:**

This system expands on the selective contact concept by *predicting* customer sentiment *before* contact is established and dynamically prioritizing communication channels based on both sentiment and real-time agent availability/skillset. It goes beyond simply authorizing contact; it optimizes *how* and *when* contact happens for maximum effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Sentiment Prediction Engine (SPE):**
    *   **Data Inputs:** System ingests data from multiple sources:
        *   **Notification Context:** The originating notification that triggered the potential contact. (e.g., a shipping delay, a billing issue)
        *   **Customer History:** Purchase history, support interactions, website browsing behavior, social media activity (if permitted).
        *   **Real-time Behavioral Signals:**  If the user is currently interacting with a website or app, capture data like mouse movements, keystroke patterns, time spent on specific pages, and form field inputs.
    *   **Model:**  Utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a massive dataset of customer interactions labeled with sentiment scores (positive, neutral, negative).  The RNN analyzes the input data streams to predict the customer's likely emotional state *before* any agent interaction. Outputs a sentiment score (0.0 - 1.0, where 0.0 is extremely negative and 1.0 is extremely positive).

2.  **Channel Prioritization Engine (CPE):**
    *   **Input:** Sentiment Score (from SPE), Customer Preferences (stored in profile – preferred contact method), Agent Availability (real-time status of all available agents), Agent Skillset (agents tagged with expertise in specific areas – e.g., billing, technical support, sales).
    *   **Logic:** CPE uses a weighted scoring system to determine the optimal communication channel.  Weights are adjustable based on A/B testing and performance analysis.
        *   **High Sentiment (0.7 - 1.0):** Prioritize lower-effort channels: Email, proactive chat with a specialized agent.
        *   **Neutral Sentiment (0.3 - 0.7):**  Balanced approach: Offer choice between chat, phone, or email.
        *   **Low Sentiment (0.0 - 0.3):** Prioritize high-touch, immediate channels: Direct phone call with a senior agent, dedicated video conference session.
    *   **Dynamic Routing:** CPE uses a queueing system that prioritizes requests based on the calculated scores.

3.  **Unified Agent Interface (UAI):**
    *   **Contextual Data:** Presents the agent with all relevant customer data *before* initiating contact: Sentiment score, notification context, customer history, predicted needs.
    *   **Scripting Assistance:** Provides the agent with dynamically generated talking points and suggested resolutions based on the sentiment score and predicted needs.
    *   **Real-time Sentiment Analysis:**  Continuously analyzes the customer’s voice/text during the interaction to refine the sentiment score and adapt the scripting assistance accordingly.

**Pseudocode (CPE - Channel Prioritization Logic):**

```
function prioritizeChannel(sentimentScore, customerPreferences, agentAvailability, agentSkillset) {

  // Define channel weights
  channelWeights = {
    "email": 0.1,
    "chat": 0.3,
    "phone": 0.6,
    "video": 0.8
  }

  // Base score based on sentiment
  baseScore = sentimentScore * 10

  // Adjust score based on customer preferences
  if (customerPreferences == "email") {
    baseScore += 5
  } else if (customerPreferences == "chat") {
    baseScore += 3
  }

  // Adjust score based on agent availability and skillset
  if (agentAvailability["phone"] > 0 && agentSkillset["billing"]) {
    baseScore += 2
  }

  // Calculate channel scores
  channelScores = {}
  for (channel in channelWeights) {
    channelScores[channel] = baseScore + channelWeights[channel]
  }

  // Sort channels by score (descending)
  sortedChannels = sortChannels(channelScores)

  // Return the highest-scoring channel
  return sortedChannels[0]
}
```

**Data Store Requirements:**

*   Customer Profiles (Preferences, History, Behavioral Data)
*   Agent Profiles (Skillsets, Availability)
*   Sentiment Training Data
*   Historical Interaction Data (for performance analysis)
*   Channel Weight Configuration (adjustable parameters)

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Proactive Issue Resolution:**  Based on sentiment prediction, proactively offer assistance before the customer even contacts support.
*   **Personalized Offers:** Based on customer history and predicted needs, offer tailored promotions or discounts during the interaction.
*   **AI-Powered Agent Assistance:** Integrate a virtual assistant to provide real-time guidance to the agent during the interaction.
