## Adaptive Predictive Prefetching with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Augment the combined cache-overflow structure with a predictive prefetching mechanism that learns temporal access patterns *within* the overflow space itself, and prioritizes prefetching overflow data *into* available cache space *before* it is explicitly requested. This effectively turns the overflow space into a dynamic, tiered storage system.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Temporal Access Monitor (TAM):** A dedicated hardware monitor tracks access patterns *within* the combined cache-overflow memory. The TAM focuses specifically on overflow entries. It records:
    *   Timestamp of access.
    *   Hash key used to access the overflow entry.
    *   An ‘access count’ incremented on each access.
2.  **Prediction Engine (PE):** The PE analyzes data from the TAM. It employs a decaying exponential average to predict future overflow access based on historical access patterns.
    *   `Predicted Access Score (PAS) =  α * Recent Access Count + (1 - α) * Decayed Historical Access Count`
        *   `α` is a learning rate constant (e.g., 0.8).
        *   ‘Recent Access Count’ is the access count from the current time window.
        *   ‘Decayed Historical Access Count’ is the exponentially decayed access count from previous time windows.
3.  **Prefetch Queue (PQ):** A small, dedicated hardware queue stores hash keys of overflow entries with the highest PAS values. The size of the PQ is configurable.
4.  **Cache Prioritization Module (CPM):** This module monitors available cache space. When space becomes available, it prioritizes prefetching overflow entries from the PQ into the cache.
    *   CPM assigns a ‘Prefetch Priority Score’ (PPS) to each entry in the PQ, based on PAS and the time since the entry was last accessed.
    *   Prefetching occurs based on the highest PPS.
5.  **Eviction Policy Modification:**  When a cache eviction is necessary, the CPM introduces a ‘Prefetch Consideration’ factor.  Entries that are being prefetched (i.e., already in the PQ) are given lower eviction priority, reducing thrashing.
6.  **Overflow Space Allocation:**  The overflow space is subdivided into ‘Prefetch Blocks’. The size of these blocks determines the granularity of prefetching.
7.  **Hardware Implementation:**
    *   TAM and PE implemented as dedicated ASIC modules.
    *   PQ implemented as a small, fast SRAM.
    *   CPM integrated into the cache controller logic.

**Pseudocode (CPM):**

```
function EvictCacheEntry():
  entry = CurrentCacheEntry
  prefetch_score = 0
  if entry.hash_key in PrefetchQueue:
    prefetch_score = PrefetchQueue[entry.hash_key].PAS
  eviction_score = EntryAge(entry) – prefetch_score
  return entry with the lowest eviction_score
```

**Refinement:**  Introduce a ‘session affinity’ component to the PAS calculation.  If multiple overflow entries share the same network session identifier, their PAS values are combined. This enhances prefetching for stateful applications.
