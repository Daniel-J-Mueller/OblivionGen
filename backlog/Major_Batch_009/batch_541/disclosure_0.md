## Delegated Action Context with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Expand the delegation profile to incorporate a time-to-live (TTL) context for each permitted action. This allows for granular control over *how long* a delegated principal can perform a specific action, even if the overall delegation profile remains active.  Furthermore, tie this TTL to a decay function â€“ actions used frequently have their TTL refreshed, while those rarely used expire sooner.

**Specs:**

*   **Delegation Profile Extension:** Add a `temporal_context` field to the delegation profile.  This field will be a list of `action_ttl` objects.
*   **`action_ttl` Object:**
    *   `action_name` (String):  The name of the action allowed within the delegation profile (e.g., "read_data", "modify_data", "access_resource").
    *   `initial_ttl` (Integer):  The starting TTL for this action in seconds.
    *   `decay_rate` (Float): A value between 0 and 1 representing the rate at which the TTL decreases if the action isn't used.  Higher values mean faster decay.
    *   `min_ttl` (Integer): The minimum allowed TTL in seconds. Prevents complete expiration.
*   **Action Invocation Interceptor:**  Implement an interceptor that sits between the security principal and the target action.
*   **Interceptor Logic:**
    1.  Receive action invocation request.
    2.  Lookup `action_ttl` within the delegation profile based on `action_name`.
    3.  Check current TTL:
        *   If TTL <= 0: Deny access and log.
        *   If TTL > 0:  Proceed with action execution.
    4.  Upon successful action execution, *refresh* the TTL:
        *   `current_ttl = initial_ttl` (reset to initial value)
*   **Background TTL Management Process:**
    *   Periodically (e.g., every minute) scan all active delegation profiles.
    *   For each `action_ttl`:
        *   If no actions have been performed: `current_ttl = max(current_ttl - decay_rate, min_ttl)`
        *   Reset `last_used` timestamp.

**Pseudocode (Interceptor):**

```
function interceptAction(principal, actionName, arguments):
  profile = getDelegationProfile(principal)
  if profile == null:
    return "Access Denied: No delegation profile found"

  actionTTL = getActionTTL(profile, actionName)
  if actionTTL == null:
    return "Access Denied: Action not permitted in delegation profile"

  if actionTTL.currentTTL <= 0:
    log("Access Denied: TTL expired for action: " + actionName)
    return "Access Denied: TTL expired"

  // Execute action
  result = executeAction(actionName, arguments)

  // Refresh TTL
  actionTTL.currentTTL = actionTTL.initialTTL

  return result
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Reduces the window of opportunity for compromised or malicious delegated principals.
*   **Granular Control:** Enables precise control over delegated permissions based on usage patterns.
*   **Dynamic Permissions:** Permissions automatically adjust based on activity.
*   **Reduced Administrative Overhead:** Automated TTL management simplifies permission lifecycle.
