## Adaptive Multicast Mesh with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the multicast/unicast recovery system to a dynamic mesh network where devices collaboratively prefetch and share data *predictively*, based on observed usage patterns and proximity. This drastically reduces reliance on the central access points for recovery, creating a more robust and scalable system, especially in dense environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Role Assignment:** Each device dynamically assesses its network role: "Source" (actively requesting/streaming content), "Relay" (capable of sharing content), or "Passive" (minimal participation). This assessment is based on available bandwidth, battery life, and recent activity.
*   **Content Fingerprinting & Bloom Filters:** All multicast streams are "fingerprinted" – a lightweight hash generated for each chunk of data. Devices maintain Bloom filters of recently received fingerprints.
*   **Proximity Detection:** Devices utilize Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beaconing or similar short-range communication to identify nearby devices.
*   **Predictive Prefetching:**
    *   A "Source" device initiating a multicast stream advertises the stream’s fingerprint and upcoming data chunks via BLE.
    *   Nearby “Relay” devices, seeing the advertisement and not having the data (verified by Bloom filter), proactively request and download the data *before* other “Source” devices request it.
    *   Relay devices prioritize prefetches based on predicted demand – analyzing request patterns from nearby devices. (e.g. if multiple devices request similar content recently, prioritize that content).
*   **Local Data Distribution:** When a "Source" device requests data, the system first checks:
    1.  Local Cache: Does the requesting device have the data?
    2.  Nearby Relays: Are any nearby Relays already caching the data? If so, data is transferred directly device-to-device.
    3.  Access Point Recovery: If not locally available, the system falls back to the existing access point recovery mechanism.
*   **Mesh Routing Protocol:** Implement a lightweight mesh routing protocol (e.g. a simplified version of OLSR or BATMAN-adv) to facilitate device-to-device data transfer. This protocol should prioritize low latency and minimal overhead.
*   **Adaptive Mesh Density:** The system dynamically adjusts the mesh density based on network load and available resources. Devices can temporarily increase their relay role if the network is congested or reduce it to conserve battery.
*   **Access Point as Mesh Coordinator:** Access points act as coordinators, monitoring mesh health, managing device roles, and facilitating initial stream discovery.

**Pseudocode (Relay Device - Prefetching):**

```
function onReceiveStreamAdvertisement(streamFingerprint, upcomingChunkHashes) {
  for each chunkHash in upcomingChunkHashes {
    if (bloomFilter.contains(chunkHash) == false) {
      requestData(chunkHash) // Initiate data download
      bloomFilter.add(chunkHash)
    }
  }
}

function requestData(chunkHash) {
  // Initiate download from source or access point
  downloadData(chunkHash)
}

function onReceiveDataRequest(chunkHash) {
  if (dataCache.contains(chunkHash)) {
    sendData(chunkHash) // Send to requesting device
  } else {
    // Forward request to another relay or access point
    forwardDataRequest(chunkHash)
  }
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   BLE module for proximity detection and initial data transfer.
*   Wi-Fi module for access point connectivity and larger data transfers.
*   Sufficient memory and processing power to cache data and run mesh routing protocols.
*   Sufficient battery capacity to support relaying operations.
