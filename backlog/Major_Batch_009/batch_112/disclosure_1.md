## Adaptive Sensitivity Mapping with Dynamic Contextualization

**Concept:** Extend the sensitive data identification system to not just *locate* sensitive data, but to dynamically map its sensitivity *level* based on the surrounding context and user roles, then to alter data access/presentation accordingly. This goes beyond simple redaction/tokenization to a nuanced system of controlled information exposure.

**Specs:**

**1. Contextual Sensitivity Engine (CSE):**

*   **Input:** Data item, user role, application context (e.g., legal review, customer service, internal audit), pre-defined sensitivity profiles.
*   **Process:**
    *   The CSE utilizes a multi-layered analysis:
        *   **Entity Recognition:** Identify sensitive entities (PII, financial data, etc.).  Leverage existing classification models.
        *   **Relationship Analysis:** Determine relationships *between* entities.  (e.g., "Patient X’s diagnosis is Y" is more sensitive than just "Diagnosis: Y"). Utilize graph databases for efficient relationship storage and traversal.
        *   **Contextual Scoring:** Assign a sensitivity score based on:
            *   Entity type
            *   Relationships to other entities
            *   Application context (legal review = higher sensitivity)
            *   User role (auditor > customer service rep)
            *   Pre-defined sensitivity profiles (configurable by admin).
*   **Output:** Sensitivity map - a data structure detailing the sensitivity score of each identified entity and its relationships within the data item.

**2. Dynamic Access Control Layer (DACL):**

*   **Input:** User request for data, data item, sensitivity map, user role.
*   **Process:**
    *   The DACL intercepts the data request.
    *   Based on the user role and the sensitivity map, the DACL dynamically modifies the data before it's presented to the user:
        *   **Redaction:** Remove highly sensitive data.
        *   **Tokenization:** Replace sensitive data with non-identifiable tokens.
        *   **Pseudonymization:** Replace sensitive data with pseudonyms.
        *   **Summarization:** Provide summarized information instead of raw data.
        *   **Highlighting/Obfuscation:**  Highlight sensitive portions, or partially obfuscate them (e.g., masking digits of a credit card number).
        *   **Contextual Filtering:**  Remove entire relationships or sections of the data item based on sensitivity thresholds.
*   **Output:** Modified data item tailored to the user’s role and access privileges.

**3.  Adaptive Learning Module (ALM):**

*   **Input:** User feedback on data access, audit logs, sensitivity map accuracy.
*   **Process:**
    *   The ALM uses machine learning to:
        *   Refine sensitivity profiles.
        *   Improve entity recognition and relationship analysis accuracy.
        *   Learn user preferences for data presentation.
        *   Detect anomalies (e.g., a user repeatedly accessing data they shouldn't)
*   **Output:** Updated sensitivity profiles, improved classification models, and anomaly alerts.

**Pseudocode (DACL):**

```
function processDataRequest(user, dataItem):
    sensitivityMap = generateSensitivityMap(dataItem)
    modifiedDataItem = dataItem.clone()

    for entity in sensitivityMap.entities:
        sensitivityScore = sensitivityMap.getScore(entity)

        if user.role == "CustomerService":
            if sensitivityScore > 0.7:  //High sensitivity
                modifiedDataItem.redact(entity)
        elif user.role == "Auditor":
            //No redaction, but add audit trail
            logAccess(user, entity)
        elif sensitivityScore > 0.9:
            modifiedDataItem.redact(entity)

    return modifiedDataItem
```

**Infrastructure Considerations:**

*   Graph database for relationship storage (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune).
*   Microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability.
*   Secure communication channels (TLS, encryption at rest).
*   Robust audit logging and monitoring.
