## Adaptive Workflow Schema Evolution

**Concept:** Extend the system to dynamically adapt data schemas *within* a workflow execution, triggered by condition validity signals. This moves beyond simply tracking validity to actively reshaping the data as it flows.

**Specification:**

1.  **Schema Repository:** Introduce a 'Schema Repository' alongside persistent storage. This repository stores multiple versions of schemas associated with objects within the data processing workflow. Each schema version is tagged with a validity period, mirroring the condition validity signals.

2.  **Schema Versioning & Association:**  When a new data transformation step is introduced, or when schema changes occur upstream, a new schema version is created in the Schema Repository.  The condition validity signal associated with an event (e.g., a data source update) triggers the association of the current schema version with that event.  This association is stored as metadata linked to the event signal.

3.  **Dynamic Schema Resolution:** At each node in the workflow, before processing data, the system queries the Schema Repository for the active schema version associated with the incoming data. This query uses the event signal's validity period as a filter.

4.  **Schema Transformation Engine:** Integrate a 'Schema Transformation Engine' capable of applying transformations to the incoming data to conform to the active schema. This engine would handle:
    *   **Adding missing fields:** Populate new fields with default values or null.
    *   **Renaming fields:** Map old field names to new ones.
    *   **Data type conversion:**  Adjust data types as needed.
    *   **Field removal:**  Drop fields no longer present in the new schema.

5. **Event-Driven Schema Updates:** Leverage the existing condition validity signals.  When a signal indicates a schema change, the system doesn’t just flag validity; it triggers a re-evaluation of schema mappings *at downstream nodes*.

**Pseudocode (Workflow Node Processing):**

```
function process_data(data, event_signal):
  active_schema = query_schema_repository(event_signal.validity_period)
  transformed_data = schema_transformation_engine.transform(data, active_schema)
  # ... continue with workflow logic using transformed_data ...
```

**Example:**

An ETL workflow receives order data. A supplier changes their data format, adding a new "shipping_weight" field. The “data source update” event generates a condition validity signal. The Schema Repository stores the new order schema.  Downstream nodes now dynamically add the "shipping_weight" field to incoming order data, defaulting to 0 if not present, ensuring compatibility without workflow downtime or manual intervention.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Automated adaptation to API changes.
*   Seamless integration of new data sources with differing schemas.
*   Dynamic A/B testing of schema variations.
*   Support for evolving data models in real-time applications.
