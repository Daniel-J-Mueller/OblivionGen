## Dynamic Authentication via Bioacoustic Resonance

**Concept:** Augment authentication by incorporating analysis of unique resonant frequencies generated during vocalization, beyond just speech *content*. This moves past ‘what is said’ to ‘*how* it is said’ at a sub-audible level.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-sensitivity, low-noise microphone array integrated into client device (smartphone, laptop, etc.). Minimum 8 channels.
    *   Dedicated audio processing unit (DSP) on the client device or cloud-based for real-time analysis.
    *   Secure enclave/TPM chip for storing individual bioacoustic profiles.
*   **Software – Enrollment Phase:**
    1.  User prompted to repeat a neutral phrase (e.g., “verify access”) multiple times (minimum 5 repetitions).
    2.  Microphone array captures audio.
    3.  DSP performs Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on each recording, isolating resonant frequencies within the vocal tract and surrounding tissues (specifically focused on frequencies between 200-800 Hz – adaptable based on user vocal characteristics).
    4.  Algorithm identifies unique “resonant signature” – a vector of dominant frequencies and their amplitudes.  Noise reduction and filtering applied.
    5.  Signature encrypted and stored in secure enclave/TPM, associated with user identifier.  Rolling hash applied to the signature for increased security.
    6.  Profile updated periodically (e.g. monthly) with new recordings to account for natural vocal changes.
*   **Software – Authentication Phase:**
    1.  User prompted to verbally state a random, system-generated phrase.  Phrase length between 4-8 syllables.
    2.  Microphone array captures audio.
    3.  DSP performs FFT, identifying resonant frequencies.
    4.  Comparison algorithm calculates a similarity score between the current resonant signature and the stored profile.  Score weighted based on frequency amplitude and stability.
    5.  If similarity score exceeds a threshold (dynamically adjusted based on environment noise levels and user history), authentication is successful.
    6.  Multi-factor authentication enabled by combining resonant signature analysis with existing methods (password, biometrics, security questions).

**Pseudocode – Authentication Comparison:**

```
function compareSignatures(storedSignature, liveSignature):
  similarityScore = 0
  for each frequencyBand in frequencyBands:
    amplitudeDiff = abs(storedSignature[frequencyBand] - liveSignature[frequencyBand])
    weight = 1 - (amplitudeDiff / maxAmplitude)  // Higher weight for closer amplitudes
    similarityScore += weight

  similarityScore = similarityScore / numFrequencyBands

  return similarityScore

```

**Innovation Details:**

This system adds a layer of passive behavioral authentication.  Unlike current voice recognition, it doesn’t analyze *what* is said, only *how* it is said—the unique physical characteristics of a user's vocal apparatus and resonant frequencies. This provides significant resistance to spoofing attempts (recordings, synthetic voice).  The dynamic threshold adjustment further enhances security by accommodating variations in environmental noise and user vocal state (e.g., illness, fatigue).
