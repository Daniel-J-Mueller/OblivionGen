## Adaptive Resonance Zone Management

**Concept:** Extend the zone-based inventory management beyond simple collision avoidance to incorporate predictive resonance modeling of entity (worker/robot) movement, dynamically adjusting zones to facilitate optimal flow and minimize congestion *before* it occurs. This goes beyond reactive path planning to proactive space allocation.

**Specs:**

*   **Resonance Mapping Module:**
    *   Input: Real-time location data of all mobile drive units and assigned mobile location units, historical movement patterns (velocity, acceleration, common routes), entity type (worker vs. robot – different profiles), task assignments (where is the entity *going*?).
    *   Process:
        1.  Identify areas of high probability 'resonance' – locations where multiple entities are likely to converge or experience conflicting trajectories within a defined time window (e.g., next 30 seconds). Utilize a modified potential field approach – 'attractive' forces toward destinations, 'repulsive' forces from predicted conflicts.
        2.  Calculate a 'resonance score' for each zone based on predicted congestion and conflict probability.
        3.  Dynamically adjust zone boundaries and shapes to redistribute flow, creating temporary 'flow channels' or 'buffer zones'. Prioritize maintaining clear paths for high-priority entities (e.g., those transporting critical materials).
*   **Zone Shaping Engine:**
    *   Input: Resonance score map, current zone configuration, entity priorities.
    *   Process:
        1.  Employ a Voronoi diagram-based algorithm to reshape zones. The diagram's seeds are dynamically adjusted based on predicted entity locations and priorities.
        2.  Implement a 'zone merging' and 'zone splitting' capability to optimize space utilization. Merging creates wider flow channels, splitting creates dedicated paths.
        3.  Constrain zone reshaping to avoid obstructing static obstacles or creating zones that are too narrow for safe passage.
*   **Proactive Path Recommendation System:**
    *   Input: Reshaped zone map, entity destinations, mobile drive unit capabilities.
    *   Process:
        1.  Generate alternative paths for mobile drive units that take advantage of the reshaped zones and minimize congestion.
        2.  Prioritize paths that facilitate smooth flow for all entities, not just those with the highest priority.
        3.  Provide 'soft guidance' to mobile drive units – suggested paths, but with the ability to override if necessary.
*   **Hardware Integration:**
    *   Existing Access Points: Utilize existing infrastructure for communication and data collection.
    *   Real-Time Processing: High-performance computing platform for processing resonance maps and generating paths.
    *   Mobile Location Units: Enhanced sensors for accurate tracking and collision avoidance.

**Pseudocode (Resonance Mapping Module):**

```
function calculate_resonance_map(entity_data, historical_data):
  resonance_map = initialize_map()
  for each entity in entity_data:
    predicted_trajectory = predict_trajectory(entity.location, entity.velocity, historical_data)
    for each other entity:
      collision_probability = calculate_collision_probability(predicted_trajectory, other_entity.predicted_trajectory)
      if collision_probability > threshold:
        resonance_map[intersection_of_trajectories] += collision_probability

  return resonance_map
```

**Novelty:**

Current systems react to congestion. This system *predicts* it and proactively reshapes the environment to prevent it, creating a more fluid and efficient inventory management system. It moves beyond static zones to a dynamic, responsive 'living' environment.
