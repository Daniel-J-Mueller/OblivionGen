## Secure Hardware Attestation & Dynamic Workload Isolation with 'Ephemeral Roots of Trust'

**Specification:** A system for dynamically generating and verifying 'Ephemeral Roots of Trust' (ERoTs) for workloads executed on remote hardware, enhancing security beyond static attestation, and enabling fine-grained workload isolation.

**Core Concept:** Current remote attestation focuses on verifying the *static* identity and configuration of hardware. This design proposes a system where each workload receives a unique, dynamically generated cryptographic root of trust *derived* from the underlying hardware, but not *identical* to it. This ERoT exists only for the duration of the workload’s execution and is destroyed afterward.

**Components:**

1.  **Dynamic ERoT Generator (DERG):** Software module residing within the service provider network.  Takes as input a workload description (hash of code, memory requirements, execution parameters) and utilizes a hardware security module (HSM) to generate a unique cryptographic key pair. This key pair *isn't* a direct copy of the remote hardware's root key. It’s derived using a deterministic random function (DRF) seeded by the remote hardware’s attested public key, the workload description, and a time-variant nonce.

    ```pseudocode
    function generateERoT(workloadDescription, remoteHardwarePublicKey, nonce):
        seed = SHA256(remoteHardwarePublicKey + workloadDescription + nonce)
        (privateKey, publicKey) = HSM.generateKeyPair(seed)
        return publicKey, privateKey // Private key remains within the provider network
    ```

2.  **Encrypted Workload Container (EWC):** The customer workload is packaged into a container encrypted using a symmetric key. This symmetric key, in turn, is encrypted using the *public* key of the generated ERoT. 

3.  **Remote Hardware Execution Module (RHEM):** A module residing on the remote hardware. 

    *   Receives the EWC.
    *   Uses the attested public key of the remote hardware to verify a signature from the DERG confirming the EWC is authorized for this hardware.
    *   Decrypts the symmetric key using the ERoT's *private* key (securely provisioned, potentially through a secure enclave, and only available during the workload's lifetime).
    *   Decrypts the EWC and executes the workload.
    *   Upon workload completion, the ERoT's private key is destroyed.

4.  **Verification Chain:** The entire process is verifiable. The DERG generates a digitally signed receipt containing the workload description, remote hardware public key, nonce, and the hash of the EWC. This receipt is provided to the customer for audit.

**Pseudocode - RHEM Execution Flow:**

```pseudocode
function executeWorkload(EWC, receipt):
    // 1. Verify Receipt Signature using remote hardware's public key
    if not verifySignature(receipt, remoteHardwarePublicKey):
        return Error("Invalid Receipt")

    // 2. Extract ERoT Public Key from Receipt
    ERoT_PublicKey = extractERoTPublicKey(receipt)

    // 3. Attempt to decrypt symmetric key using ERoT Public Key
    symmetricKey = decryptSymmetricKey(EWC, ERoT_PublicKey)

    // 4. Attempt to decrypt EWC using symmetric key
    workload = decryptWorkload(EWC, symmetricKey)

    // 5. Execute Workload
    execute(workload)

    // 6. Destroy ERoT Private Key (handled separately by secure enclave)
```

**Novelty:**

*   **Dynamic, Workload-Specific Roots of Trust:**  Traditional attestation verifies the hardware. This creates a new root of trust *for* the workload, minimizing the impact of hardware compromise on specific workloads.
*   **Ephemeral Key Management:** The transient nature of the ERoT significantly reduces the attack surface.  Compromising the ERoT private key only affects a single workload execution, not the entire system.
*   **Auditable Verification Chain:** The receipt provides a verifiable record of the entire process, enhancing trust and transparency.
