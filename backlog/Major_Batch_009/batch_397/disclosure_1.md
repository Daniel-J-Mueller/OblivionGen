## Dynamic Network Slice Composition based on Client Behavioral Prediction

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive Network Slice Composer (PNSC) – A software module residing within the cloud provider’s network orchestration system.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time client device network usage data (bandwidth, latency, application type, frequency of requests).
    *   Historical client behavioral data (usage patterns, time of day, day of week, location - anonymized/aggregated).
    *   Application profiles (QoS requirements, resource consumption estimates).
    *   Network Resource Availability (current capacity of network functions & infrastructure).
*   **Prediction Engine:** Employ a hybrid machine learning model (Recurrent Neural Network + Long Short-Term Memory) to predict future network resource demands for each client device over a short time horizon (e.g., 5-15 minutes).  The model will factor in historical data, current usage, and application profiles.
*   **Slice Composition Algorithm:**
    1.  Based on predicted resource demands, the PNSC dynamically composes network slices for each client device.
    2.  Network slices are not static; they are fluid and adapt in real-time.
    3.  Prioritize critical applications (e.g., video conferencing, emergency services) within the slice composition.
    4.  Utilize a resource allocation engine to distribute network functions (NF) and infrastructure resources efficiently across slices.
    5.  Employ Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to enable flexible slice creation and management.
*   **Network Slice Profiles:** Define pre-configured slice templates with varying levels of QoS (bandwidth, latency, packet loss) and resource allocation. The PNSC selects the appropriate template based on predicted demand.
*   **Monitoring and Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitor slice performance and compare it to predicted demand.  Use this data to refine the prediction model and improve slice composition accuracy.
*   **API Integration:** Provide APIs for applications to request specific QoS levels or indicate the criticality of their traffic.
*   **Security:** Implement robust security measures to isolate slices and prevent unauthorized access.

**Pseudocode – Slice Composition Process:**

```
FUNCTION ComposeSlice(clientID, predictedDemand):
    sliceProfile = SelectSliceProfile(predictedDemand)
    resourceAllocation = AllocateResources(sliceProfile)
    networkFunctions = InstantiateNetworkFunctions(resourceAllocation)
    networkPath = CalculateNetworkPath(networkFunctions)
    configureNetwork(networkPath, QoSparameters)
    return sliceID
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION SelectSliceProfile(predictedDemand):
    IF predictedDemand.bandwidth > HIGH_THRESHOLD AND predictedDemand.latency < LOW_THRESHOLD:
        RETURN PremiumSliceProfile
    ELSE IF predictedDemand.bandwidth > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
        RETURN StandardSliceProfile
    ELSE:
        RETURN BasicSliceProfile
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

**Innovation Detail:**

This system shifts from static prioritization (as described in the provided patent) to *proactive*, *predictive* resource allocation.  Instead of reacting to capacity limits, it *anticipates* demand and prepares the network accordingly.  The machine learning component allows the system to learn individual client behaviors and optimize resource allocation accordingly, creating a more efficient and personalized network experience. It moves beyond simply giving priority to a client; it dynamically shapes the network to *meet* their predicted needs *before* congestion occurs. This allows for not just prioritization, but true Quality of Experience (QoE) management.
