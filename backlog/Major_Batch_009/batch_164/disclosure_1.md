## Adaptive Database Sharding via Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the database proxy’s ability to select relational databases not just based on connection score/cost metrics, but also on *predicted* load. This system aims to proactively distribute queries to databases predicted to have available capacity, minimizing latency and maximizing throughput.

**Specifications:**

**1. Load Prediction Module:**

*   **Data Source:** Collects metrics from each relational database server: CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, query execution times (average, 95th percentile), number of active connections, and queue length.  Also collects request types/complexity from the proxy itself.
*   **Model:** Employs a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet, ARIMA) trained on historical data to predict future load levels for each database. Multiple models per database may exist - one for each request type.
*   **Training:**  Models are retrained periodically (e.g., hourly, daily) with the most recent data.  A feedback loop adjusts model weights based on actual observed performance.
*   **Output:**  Each database is assigned a “predicted load score” representing its anticipated capacity utilization over a defined prediction window (e.g., next 5 seconds, next 1 minute).

**2.  Intelligent Query Routing:**

*   **Request Analysis:**  When a request arrives, the proxy analyzes its complexity (estimated execution cost based on query plan) and resource requirements.
*   **Candidate Database Selection:** The proxy selects a subset of candidate databases based on initial connection score (as in the base patent).
*   **Load-Aware Scoring:** For each candidate, the predicted load score is incorporated into the overall scoring function.  A weighting factor determines the relative importance of connection score vs. predicted load.  Higher weighting to predicted load during peak hours.
*   **Dynamic Sharding:**  For complex queries, the proxy automatically *shards* the query into sub-queries and distributes them across multiple databases with available capacity. This requires query rewriting capabilities.  Sub-query results are aggregated by the proxy before being returned to the client.
*   **Fallback Mechanism:** If all candidate databases are predicted to be overloaded, the proxy falls back to a queuing system or returns a temporary error message to the client.

**3.  System Architecture:**

*   **Proxy Server:**  Hosts the Load Prediction Module and Intelligent Query Routing logic.  Requires significant processing power and memory.
*   **Database Servers:**  Standard relational database servers.  Must expose performance metrics in a standardized format.
*   **Monitoring Service:**  Collects performance metrics from database servers and feeds them to the Load Prediction Module.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  gRPC or similar for efficient communication between proxy, databases, and monitoring service.

**Pseudocode (Intelligent Query Routing):**

```
function route_query(query, client_info):
  candidate_databases = get_candidate_databases(client_info)
  
  for db in candidate_databases:
    predicted_load = get_predicted_load(db)
    connection_score = get_connection_score(db, client_info)
    
    overall_score = (weight_connection * connection_score) + (weight_load * (1 - predicted_load))
    scored_databases.append((db, overall_score))
  
  best_db = max(scored_databases, key=lambda item: item[1])

  if query_complexity > threshold:
    sharded_queries = shard_query(query)
    
    for subquery in sharded_queries:
      best_db_for_subquery = select_best_db(best_db, subquery) #may be different DB

      execute_subquery(subquery, best_db_for_subquery)
    
    aggregated_result = aggregate_results()
    return aggregated_result
  else:
    result = execute_query(query, best_db)
    return result
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **A/B testing:** Evaluate the performance of the load-aware routing algorithm against the existing algorithm.
*   **Self-learning:** Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically adjust the weighting factors based on observed performance.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Identify and isolate database servers that are experiencing unexpected performance degradation.
*   **Multi-Region Support:** Extend the system to support geographically distributed database servers, enabling cross-region query routing based on latency and availability.
