## Proactive Contextual Task Chains

**Concept:** Extend the predictive command framework to not just *anticipate* the next command, but to proactively assemble a *chain* of related tasks, offering a streamlined, multi-step experience.  Rather than simply predicting the next command, the system predicts a likely *sequence* of commands, pre-fetches relevant data/options, and presents a guided workflow.

**Specifications:**

**1. Task Chain Graph:**

*   **Data Structure:** A directed graph where nodes represent individual tasks (user commands/intents) and edges represent probabilistic transitions between tasks based on historical user interaction data.  Nodes store:
    *   Task ID (unique identifier)
    *   Task Description (human-readable)
    *   Required Input Parameters (data types, constraints)
    *   Associated Content (pre-fetched data, options, UI elements)
    *   Successor Nodes (list of possible next tasks with associated probabilities)
*   **Graph Construction:**
    *   Analyze historical user interaction data to identify common task sequences.
    *   Employ machine learning (e.g., Markov models, recurrent neural networks) to model task transition probabilities.
    *   Dynamically update the graph based on real-time user behavior.
*   **Contextualization:** The graph must be personalized and context-aware. Consider factors such as:
    *   User profile (preferences, habits)
    *   Device type (mobile, desktop, smart speaker)
    *   Location (home, work, travel)
    *   Time of day

**2. Proactive Task Presentation:**

*   **Prediction Engine:**  Based on the current user command, the system predicts the most likely task chain using the task graph.
*   **Pre-fetching:** The system pre-fetches data and options required for the predicted tasks.
*   **UI Presentation:**  Present the user with a list of predicted tasks (e.g., as a carousel, menu, or suggestion chips).
    *   Display the task description and any relevant pre-fetched data.
    *   Provide a confidence score for each predicted task.
    *   Allow the user to select a task to execute it immediately or dismiss the suggestion.
*   **Adaptive Presentation:**  Dynamically adjust the presentation based on user interaction.
    *   If the user consistently dismisses certain suggestions, decrease their probability in the task graph.
    *   If the user frequently selects a particular task, increase its probability.

**3. Pseudocode:**

```
function predict_task_chain(current_command, user_profile, context):
  // Load the task graph
  task_graph = load_task_graph()

  // Find the current node in the graph corresponding to the current command
  current_node = find_node_by_command(task_graph, current_command)

  // If current node not found, create a new node
  if current_node is null:
    current_node = create_node(current_command)
    add_node_to_graph(task_graph, current_node)

  // Predict the next tasks based on the transition probabilities
  next_tasks = predict_next_tasks(current_node)

  // Sort the next tasks by probability
  sorted_tasks = sort_tasks_by_probability(next_tasks)

  // Fetch data for the top N tasks
  for task in sorted_tasks[:N]:
    fetch_task_data(task)

  // Return the sorted tasks with pre-fetched data
  return sorted_tasks
```

**4. Enhancement - "Ghost Mode"**

*   The system silently pre-executes steps of the predicted task chain in the background ("ghost mode") *without* immediate user interaction.
*   If the pre-execution is successful and the system is confident in the outcome, it presents the user with a summary of the completed steps and prompts for confirmation or further action. This could dramatically streamline common workflows.
*   Example: User says "Book a flight to London". System silently searches for flights, identifies a likely option based on past preferences, and presents the user with a confirmation screen: "We found a flight to London departing on [date] at [time]. Confirm booking?".
