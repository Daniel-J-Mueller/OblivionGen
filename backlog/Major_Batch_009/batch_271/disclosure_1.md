## Adaptive Layer Tree Streaming with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the composited layer tree approach by introducing adaptive streaming of layer data *and* a predictive prefetching mechanism based on user interaction and viewport proximity. This aims to minimize perceived latency and improve responsiveness, particularly on networks with variable bandwidth.

**Specs:**

**1. Layer Tree Subdivision & Priority:**

*   The server-side composited layer tree is recursively subdivided into smaller, manageable “layer chunks.”  A chunk represents a rectangular region of the overall webpage.
*   Each layer chunk is assigned a priority score based on:
    *   **Viewport Proximity:** Distance from the current viewport. Closer = higher priority.
    *   **Content Type:** Static assets (images, CSS) receive higher priority than dynamic content.
    *   **Historical User Interaction:** Areas frequently interacted with (e.g., clicked, hovered) receive higher priority. (Requires client-side tracking – see below).
    *   **Semantic Importance:** Utilize basic semantic analysis (e.g., headings, primary content blocks) to assign higher priority to important content.

**2. Client-Side Interaction Tracking & Prediction:**

*   The client tracks user interactions (mouse movements, clicks, scrolls) and builds a “heat map” of user attention.
*   A predictive algorithm uses this heat map and scroll direction to *forecast* which areas of the page the user is likely to view next.  This prediction influences the prefetch queue (see below).

**3. Adaptive Streaming Protocol:**

*   Establish a persistent WebSocket connection between client and server.
*   The server streams layer chunks to the client based on priority and the client's viewport.
*   The client requests chunks as needed, but the server proactively sends high-priority chunks before they are explicitly requested (pre-fetching).
*   The streaming protocol supports multiple quality levels for each chunk.  The server dynamically adjusts quality based on network bandwidth and client capabilities. (Similar to adaptive bitrate streaming in video).

**4. Prefetch Queue Management:**

*   The client maintains a prefetch queue containing layer chunks predicted to be viewed next.
*   The queue is prioritized based on:
    *   Viewport proximity.
    *   User interaction history.
    *   Semantic importance.
*   The client periodically requests chunks from the prefetch queue in the background.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// Event: User scroll/mouse move
function handleInteraction(event) {
  updateUserHeatmap(event);
  predictNextViewableArea();
  recalculatePrefetchQueue();
}

function recalculatePrefetchQueue() {
  // Clear existing queue
  prefetchQueue = [];

  // Add chunks based on viewport proximity, heatmap, and semantics
  for (chunk in allChunks) {
    priority = calculateChunkPriority(chunk);
    if (priority > threshold) {
      prefetchQueue.push(chunk);
    }
  }

  // Sort queue by priority
  prefetchQueue.sort(function(a, b) { return b.priority - a.priority; });
}

function requestChunk(chunk) {
  // If chunk is not already in cache
  if (!isChunkCached(chunk)) {
    sendRequestToServer(chunk);
  }
}

// Background thread:
while (true) {
  if (prefetchQueue.length > 0) {
    chunk = prefetchQueue.shift();
    requestChunk(chunk);
  }
  sleep(50ms); // Adjust as needed
}
```

**Server-Side Adaptations:**

*   Implement the streaming protocol over WebSockets.
*   Implement the layer tree subdivision and priority assignment logic.
*   Cache frequently accessed layer chunks.
*   Dynamically adjust quality levels based on client capabilities and network bandwidth.
*   Implement a mechanism to track client capabilities and bandwidth.
