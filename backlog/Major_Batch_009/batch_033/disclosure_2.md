## Dynamic Dictionary Partitioning & Predictive Snapshotting

**Concept:** Expand upon the snapshotting idea by introducing dynamic partitioning of the compression dictionary *and* predictive snapshot generation based on usage patterns. Instead of treating the dictionary as a monolithic entity, break it down into functional partitions.  Furthermore, proactively generate snapshots *before* significant changes occur, leveraging observed usage to predict which partitions are likely to be modified.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dictionary Partitioning:**

*   **Partitioning Criteria:**  The dictionary is partitioned based on semantic meaning or functional area. Example:  one partition for common English words, another for programming keywords, a third for user-specific jargon, etc.  The system should allow for customizable partitioning schemes.  Administrative tooling is required for defining and adjusting these criteria.
*   **Metadata:** Each partition maintains metadata including:
    *   Last Modified Timestamp
    *   Usage Count (frequency of access)
    *   Volatility Score (estimated rate of change, determined through historical analysis)
    *   Partition Size
*   **Data Structure:** Implement a hierarchical tree structure to represent the dictionary. Each node represents a partition, and leaves contain the actual definitions.

**2. Predictive Snapshotting Engine:**

*   **Usage Monitoring:** Continuously monitor dictionary access patterns. Track which partitions are being read/written most frequently.
*   **Volatility Analysis:**  Calculate a ‘Volatility Score’ for each partition based on historical modification rates and current usage patterns. A moving average and weighted recent history would be key components of this.
*   **Snapshot Prediction:**
    *   Define a ‘Snapshot Threshold’ – a value representing the acceptable level of change before a snapshot is triggered.
    *   If the Volatility Score of a partition exceeds the Snapshot Threshold, *immediately* trigger a snapshot of that specific partition (not the entire dictionary).
*   **Snapshot Types:**
    *   **Full Partition Snapshot:** Capture the entire state of the partition.
    *   **Differential Snapshot:** Capture only the changes made since the last snapshot. Differential snapshots are preferred for frequently modified partitions.
*   **Snapshot Management:**
    *   Implement a retention policy for snapshots. Old snapshots are automatically deleted to conserve storage space.
    *   A snapshot index will maintain a list of available snapshots for each partition, along with their timestamps and sizes.

**3. System Architecture**

*   **Snapshotting Service:** A dedicated service responsible for managing snapshot generation, storage, and retrieval.
*   **Dictionary Access Proxy:** All dictionary access requests are routed through a proxy that intercepts requests and determines whether to retrieve definitions from the current dictionary state or from a previous snapshot.
*   **Data Storage:** Utilize a distributed storage system (e.g., object storage) to store snapshots.

**4. Pseudocode – Snapshotting Service (Simplified)**

```pseudocode
function monitorDictionaryAccess(partitionID, accessType)
    recordAccess(partitionID, accessType)
    updateVolatilityScore(partitionID)
    checkSnapshotThreshold(partitionID)

function checkSnapshotThreshold(partitionID)
    if volatilityScore(partitionID) > snapshotThreshold then
        generateSnapshot(partitionID)

function generateSnapshot(partitionID)
    if isDifferentialSnapshotEnabled(partitionID) then
        differentialSnapshot = calculateDifferential(partitionID, lastSnapshot(partitionID))
        storeSnapshot(partitionID, differentialSnapshot)
    else
        fullSnapshot = getFullState(partitionID)
        storeSnapshot(partitionID, fullSnapshot)
```

**5. API Endpoints:**

*   `/partitions`:  Retrieve list of available partitions and their metadata.
*   `/snapshots/{partitionID}`:  Retrieve list of snapshots for a specific partition.
*   `/snapshots/{partitionID}/{snapshotID}`:  Retrieve a specific snapshot.
*   `/partitions/{partitionID}/settings`: Configure snapshotting settings for a partition.
