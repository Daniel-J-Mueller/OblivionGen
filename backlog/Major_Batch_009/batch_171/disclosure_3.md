## Adaptive Query Rewriting with Materialized View Synthesis

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Dynamically synthesize materialized views *on-the-fly* based on predicted query patterns and available system resources, rather than relying solely on pre-defined, static materialized views. This shifts from a "store and serve" model to a "construct and serve" model.

**II. Components:**

*   **Query Pattern Predictor (QPP):** A machine learning model trained on historical query logs. The QPP predicts future query characteristics (e.g., predicates, join conditions, aggregated columns) with associated confidence levels. It outputs potential query templates.
*   **Materialized View Synthesizer (MVS):** Based on the predicted query templates and available system resources (CPU, memory, I/O), the MVS dynamically constructs temporary, in-memory materialized views.  These views are optimized for the predicted query.
*   **Resource Manager (RM):** Monitors system resource usage and allocates resources to the MVS. The RM enforces limits to prevent resource exhaustion.  It also prioritizes view synthesis based on predicted query impact (e.g., frequently executed queries, queries with high latency).
*   **Query Rewriter (QR):**  Intercepts incoming queries and rewrites them to utilize the synthesized materialized views when appropriate.  The QR assesses the cost of rewriting vs. executing the original query.
*   **View Eviction Policy (VEP):** Determines when synthesized views should be evicted from memory.  This policy considers view age, usage frequency, and resource pressure. Least Recently Used (LRU) is a baseline, but more sophisticated policies incorporating predicted future usage are preferred.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Prediction:** The QPP analyzes historical query logs to predict future query patterns.
2.  **Synthesis:** Based on the predictions and available resources, the MVS dynamically synthesizes in-memory materialized views.
3.  **Query Interception:** The QR intercepts incoming queries.
4.  **Rewrite Assessment:** The QR assesses the cost of rewriting the query to utilize a synthesized view vs. executing the original query. If rewriting offers a significant performance benefit, the query is rewritten.
5.  **Query Execution:** The rewritten or original query is executed.
6.  **View Usage Monitoring:** The system monitors the usage of synthesized views.
7.  **View Eviction:** The VEP evicts unused or low-priority views to free up resources.

**IV. Pseudocode (Query Rewriter):**

```
function rewriteQuery(query) {
  candidateViews = findCandidateViews(query); // Identify views potentially useful for this query
  if (candidateViews.isEmpty()) {
    return query; // No suitable views found
  }

  bestView = selectBestView(candidateViews, query); // Select the view offering the greatest performance benefit

  rewrittenQuery = rewriteQueryUsingView(query, bestView); // Rewrite the query to utilize the selected view

  costOriginal = estimateCost(query);
  costRewritten = estimateCost(rewrittenQuery);

  if (costRewritten < costOriginal) {
    return rewrittenQuery;
  } else {
    return query;
  }
}
```

**V. Data Structures:**

*   **Query Template:**  Represents a generalized query pattern (e.g., `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1 WHERE predicate1 AND predicate2`).  Includes placeholders for specific values.
*   **View Metadata:** Stores information about synthesized views (e.g., columns, predicates, data source, creation time, usage count).

**VI.  Novelty & Benefits:**

*   **Dynamic Optimization:** Adapts to changing query workloads in real-time, unlike static materialized views.
*   **Reduced Storage Overhead:** No need to store pre-defined materialized views, saving storage space.
*   **Improved Query Performance:**  Optimized views can significantly reduce query latency.
*   **Proactive Optimization:** Predicts future query needs and proactively synthesizes views.

**VII.  Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Federated Synthesis:** Synthesize views across multiple data sources.
*   **Cost-Based Optimization:** Develop a more sophisticated cost model for query rewriting.
*   **Automated View Tuning:** Automatically tune view parameters (e.g., data partitioning, indexing) to maximize performance.
*   **Integration with Auto-ML:** Use auto-ML techniques to automatically discover optimal view configurations.
