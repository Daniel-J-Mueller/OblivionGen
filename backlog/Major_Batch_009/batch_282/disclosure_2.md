## Adaptive Projection for Multi-User Collaborative Environments

**Concept:** Extend the adaptive projection system to dynamically adjust projected content *based on the interaction and gaze direction of multiple users* within the projected space. Imagine a shared tabletop display where content shifts and morphs not just based on obstruction, but on *who* is looking at *what*.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution multi-camera system (minimum 4 cameras) for accurate 3D reconstruction of user positions and orientations.
    *   Eye-tracking integration (integrated into glasses/headsets, or via dedicated eye-tracking sensors) to determine user gaze direction with high precision.
    *   Optional: Hand/body tracking via depth sensors (e.g., Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect) to capture user gestures and interactions.
*   **Projection System:**
    *   Multiple high-luminosity projectors with edge blending and warping capabilities for creating a seamless projected surface. (Minimum 3)
    *   Short-throw projectors to minimize shadow obstruction.
    *   Polarization filters to reduce glare and improve visibility.
*   **Computing Platform:**
    *   High-performance GPU cluster for real-time processing of sensor data and rendering of projected content.
    *   Dedicated CPU cores for managing sensor fusion and application logic.
    *   Low-latency network connectivity for communication between sensors, computing platform, and projectors.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Sensor Fusion Module:** Combines data from multiple sensors (cameras, eye-trackers, depth sensors) to create a unified representation of the environment and user interactions. Kalman filtering or similar techniques to reduce noise and improve accuracy.
    *   **Gaze-Aware Content Adaptation Module:**
        *   Determines the focal point of each user’s gaze within the projected space.
        *   Dynamically adjusts the projected content to prioritize information relevant to the user’s gaze.
        *   Techniques:
            *   **Content Highlighting:** Emphasize objects or information that a user is looking at.
            *   **Perspective Shifting:** Adjust the perspective of the projected content to align with the user’s viewpoint.
            *   **Information Layering:** Display additional information or details when a user focuses on a specific object.
        *   Pseudocode:

```
for each user in userList:
    gazePoint = getUserGazePoint(user)
    relevantObjects = findObjectsNear(gazePoint)
    for object in relevantObjects:
        highlightObject(object, user)
        if user is interacting with object:
            displayInteractiveElements(object, user)
```

    *   **Obstruction Handling:** Extends existing obstruction handling to account for multiple users and dynamic obstructions.
    *   **Multi-User Interaction Management:** Facilitates collaborative interactions between multiple users.
    *   **User Profile Management:** Stores user preferences and interaction history for personalized experiences.
*   **Calibration and Configuration:**
    *   Automated calibration procedures for aligning sensors, projectors, and projected surface.
    *   Configurable parameters for adjusting content adaptation, obstruction handling, and user interaction management.

**Use Cases:**

*   **Collaborative Design Review:** Multiple engineers can review 3D models and designs in a shared projected space, with content dynamically adapting to their viewpoints and interactions.
*   **Interactive Training Simulations:**  Trainees can interact with virtual environments and simulations, with content adapting to their actions and progress.
*   **Immersive Data Visualization:** Data analysts can explore complex datasets in a shared projected space, with content adapting to their areas of interest.
*   **Enhanced Gaming Experiences:**  Multiple players can immerse themselves in shared gaming environments, with content adapting to their actions and interactions.
