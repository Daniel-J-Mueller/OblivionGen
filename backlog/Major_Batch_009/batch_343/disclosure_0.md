## Delegated AI Persona & Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the delegation framework to encompass AI personas, allowing entities to not just access resources *as* a user, but to *deploy* and manage tailored AI agents acting on their behalf, with funding dynamically allocated based on agent performance & resource consumption.

**Specifications:**

**1. AI Persona Profiles:**

*   **Data Structure:**
    ```
    {
      persona_id: UUID,
      entity_id: UUID, //Requesting Entity
      base_persona: String, //Base AI model (e.g., GPT-4, Llama-2)
      specialization: String, //Specific AI skillset (e.g., “Customer Support - Tier 1”, “Data Analysis - Financial Modeling”)
      access_scope: Array[ResourceID], //Resources this persona can access
      funding_limit: Float, //Maximum funding allocated to this persona
      performance_metrics: Object, //Track relevant KPIs (e.g., resolution rate, accuracy)
      activation_triggers: Array[Event], //Events that activate the persona (e.g., new support ticket, data update)
      deactivation_triggers: Array[Event] //Events that deactivate the persona
    }
    ```

*   **Creation Process:** An entity, via a dedicated UI, defines a new AI Persona profile, specifying the base model, specialization, access scope, and initial funding limit.  The system validates access scope against existing resource permissions.

**2. Dynamic Funding Allocation:**

*   **Resource Consumption Tracking:**  A monitoring system tracks the resources consumed by each active AI Persona (API calls to base model, data storage, computational resources).

*   **Performance-Based Funding Adjustment:**
    ```pseudocode
    function adjustFunding(persona_id, performance_metrics) {
        if (performance_metrics.resolutionRate > 0.8 && performance_metrics.accuracy > 0.9) {
            increaseFunding(persona_id, 10%);
        } else if (performance_metrics.resolutionRate < 0.5 || performance_metrics.accuracy < 0.7) {
            decreaseFunding(persona_id, 20%);
        }
    }
    ```
    The funding adjustment logic will be configurable via admin interface, supporting a variety of metrics and thresholds.

*   **Automatic Top-Up:**  When an AI Persona's funding falls below a predefined threshold, the system automatically attempts to top it up using the entity's allocated budget or via pre-approved funding sources (e.g. linked payment method, advertising revenue).

**3.  Advertising Integration for AI Persona Funding:**

*   **Persona-Targeted Ads:**  The system displays targeted ads to the specified user or within the application used by the entity.  Ad relevance is determined based on the AI Persona's specialization and the current task.

*   **Ad Revenue Allocation:**  A configurable percentage of ad revenue is allocated to the AI Persona's funding.

*   **User Opt-Out:** Users have the option to opt-out of personalized advertising or to contribute directly to the AI Persona’s funding.

**4. Security Considerations:**

*   **Persona Isolation:** Each AI Persona operates within a secure sandbox to prevent unauthorized access to resources or data.

*   **API Key Rotation:** Frequent rotation of API keys used by AI Personas.

*   **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive logging of all AI Persona activities.

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Backend:** Microservices architecture with a central AI Persona Management Service.
*   **Database:**  Graph database to model relationships between entities, AI Personas, resources, and funding sources.
*   **API:** RESTful API for managing AI Personas, monitoring resource consumption, and adjusting funding.
*   **Frontend:**  Web-based UI for creating, managing, and monitoring AI Personas.
