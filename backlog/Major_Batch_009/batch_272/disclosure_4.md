## Adaptive Simulation Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the fidelity and computational cost of the simulation based on the reinforcement learning model's learning progress and the criticality of the simulated state.

**Rationale:** The patent describes a system for training RL models *within* a simulation. A constant-fidelity simulation is computationally expensive and may provide redundant information, especially as the model matures. Conversely, a consistently low-fidelity simulation might hinder learning in critical states. This design aims for an adaptive approach.

**Specifications:**

**1. State Criticality Assessment Module:**

   *   **Input:** Current state of the simulation environment, reward signal, RL modelâ€™s confidence level (e.g., entropy of the policy distribution).
   *   **Process:** Employ a pre-trained (or concurrently trained) criticality estimator (a lightweight neural network). This estimator predicts the potential impact of the current state on overall learning. Factors considered:
        *   Reward magnitude.
        *   State novelty (distance from previously visited states).
        *   Policy uncertainty (entropy).
   *   **Output:** Criticality score (0.0 - 1.0).  Higher values indicate greater criticality.

**2. Simulation Fidelity Controller:**

   *   **Input:** Criticality score from the State Criticality Assessment Module, current simulation fidelity level, computational budget.
   *   **Process:** Implement a state machine with defined fidelity levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High).  Transition between levels based on the criticality score and available computational resources.
        *   **Low:** Simplified physics, coarse mesh, reduced sensor data. (Fastest, least accurate)
        *   **Medium:** Balanced accuracy and speed.
        *   **High:** Full fidelity physics, fine mesh, comprehensive sensor data. (Slowest, most accurate)
        *   Transition Logic:
            *   If Criticality > Threshold_High AND Resources Available: Increase fidelity.
            *   If Criticality < Threshold_Low AND Resources Constrained: Decrease fidelity.
   *   **Output:** Target simulation fidelity level.

**3. Simulation Environment Adaptation Layer:**

   *   **Input:** Target fidelity level, simulation state.
   *   **Process:** Dynamically adjust simulation parameters based on the target level. This may involve:
        *   Level of Detail (LOD) scaling for visual elements.
        *   Simplification of physics calculations (e.g., using simplified collision detection).
        *   Reduction of sensor data frequency or resolution.
        *   Selective activation/deactivation of certain simulation components.
   *   **Output:** Updated simulation environment ready for the next step.

**4.  RL Model Interaction:**

   *   The RL model receives observations from the adapted simulation environment.
   *   The reward signal is calculated based on the actions taken within the adapted simulation.
   *   The training process continues as described in the original patent.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (training_not_complete):
  criticality_score = State_Criticality_Assessment(current_state, reward, policy_entropy)
  target_fidelity = Simulation_Fidelity_Controller(criticality_score, current_fidelity, resources)
  adapted_simulation = Simulation_Environment_Adaptation(target_fidelity, current_state)
  observation = adapted_simulation.step(action)
  reward = adapted_simulation.calculate_reward()
  train_RL_model(observation, reward)
  current_fidelity = target_fidelity // Update for next iteration
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Automated Threshold Tuning:** Use reinforcement learning to learn optimal thresholds for fidelity transitions.
*   **Multi-Fidelity Training:** Train multiple RL models concurrently, each with a different fidelity level, and combine their knowledge.
*   **Predictive Fidelity Adjustment:** Use a predictive model to anticipate future criticality and adjust fidelity proactively.
