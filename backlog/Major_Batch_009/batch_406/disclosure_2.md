## Dynamic Environment ‘Echo’ System

**Core Concept:** Extend environmental categorization beyond static image/audio analysis to create a persistent, evolving ‘echo’ of the environment’s recent activity, influencing device behavior over time.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Acquisition:**
    *   Continuous image/audio capture (low frame/sample rate – prioritizing persistence over high fidelity).
    *   Sensor data integration: temperature, humidity, light levels, motion detection.
    *   User interaction logging: device usage patterns, voice commands, app activity (privacy-preserving aggregation).
*   **‘Echo’ Buffer:**
    *   Circular buffer storing time-series data from all sensors.  Buffer size configurable (e.g., 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours).
    *   Data compression/abstraction: convert raw data into a feature vector representing environmental ‘state’.
*   **Echo Vector Generation:**
    *   Algorithm to combine current sensor data with historical data from the ‘Echo’ buffer.
    *   Weighted average/convolution – recent data has higher weight.
    *   Feature extraction: identify patterns and trends in the historical data (e.g., increasing noise levels, consistent light patterns, periodic activity).
*   **Categorization & Parameter Adjustment:**
    *   Environment categories defined (e.g., ‘Quiet Study’, ‘Active Kitchen’, ‘Evening Relaxation’).
    *   Categorization based on both current *and* historical ‘Echo’ vectors.
    *   Device parameters adjusted based on the *combination* of category *and* historical trends. 
*   **Adaptive Learning:**
    *   User feedback mechanism (explicit/implicit) to refine categorization and parameter settings.
    *   Reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize device behavior based on user preferences and environmental context.

**Pseudocode (Category Selection):**

```
function select_category(current_echo_vector, historical_echo_vectors, established_categories):
    // Calculate similarity scores between current/historical vectors & each category.
    similarity_scores = calculate_similarity(current_echo_vector, established_categories) +
                       calculate_historical_similarity(historical_echo_vectors, established_categories)

    // Apply prior scores based on frequency of category selection.
    prior_scores = get_prior_scores(established_categories)

    // Calculate combined scores (similarity + prior).
    combined_scores = [s + p for s, p in zip(similarity_scores, prior_scores)]

    // Normalize scores (softmax).
    normalized_scores = softmax(combined_scores)

    // Select category with highest normalized score.
    selected_category = argmax(normalized_scores)

    return selected_category
```

**Example Application:**  Smart Lighting System

*   Traditional System: Detects low light level, turns on lights.
*   ‘Echo’ System: Detects consistent low light levels in the evening *combined with* historical data indicating ‘Evening Relaxation’ category, adjusts lights to warm, dim setting *and* automatically silences notifications on connected devices.
