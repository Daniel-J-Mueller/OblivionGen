## Adaptive Keyboard Macro Generation via Predictive Text & Application State

**Concept:** Expand beyond static login information storage to create a system that *learns* user workflows within applications and generates custom keyboard macros on-demand, triggered by application state and predictive text analysis.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Application State Monitor:** A background process that monitors the active application and its UI elements (window titles, active controls, visible text fields, etc.). Utilizes OS-level APIs (Windows Accessibility API, macOS Accessibility API) to extract this information.
*   **Predictive Text Engine:** A localized, privacy-focused predictive text engine (similar to those found in smartphone keyboards) trained on the user's typing history *within specific applications*. This is distinct from system-wide predictive text and operates independently.
*   **Macro Generation Engine:**  A rule-based system combined with a lightweight scripting language (Lua, Python) to dynamically create keyboard macros.  The rules are seeded with common application workflows (e.g., "new document," "save as," "search") and refined by the user's actions.
*   **Keyboard Application Integration:**  A plugin or extension for the keyboard application (or OS-level keyboard handler) to receive macro definitions and execute them on keypresses.
*   **User Interface:**  A settings panel within the keyboard application for managing application-specific profiles, reviewing suggested macros, and manually editing/creating macros.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Application Launch:** When a new application is launched, the Application State Monitor begins tracking its UI elements and user interactions.
2.  **Data Collection:** The system logs user keystrokes, mouse clicks, and UI element interactions within the application.
3.  **Pattern Recognition:** The Predictive Text Engine analyzes keystroke patterns and attempts to predict the next likely input. Simultaneously, the Application State Monitor identifies the current UI context.
4.  **Macro Suggestion:** Based on the predicted input and the UI context, the Macro Generation Engine creates a suggested macro. For example:
    *   User types "new" in a document editor, and the active control is the "File" menu. The system suggests a macro to open the "New Document" dialog.
    *   User types "save" and the active control is the "File" menu, the system suggests a macro to open the "Save As" dialog.
5.  **Macro Presentation:** The suggested macro is presented to the user via a subtle visual cue on the keyboard interface (e.g., a pop-up near the suggested key, a colored highlight).
6.  **Macro Activation:** If the user activates the suggestion (e.g., by pressing a designated key or clicking on the cue), the macro is executed.
7.  **Learning & Refinement:** The system logs successful macro executions and uses this data to refine its prediction models and macro generation rules.

**3. Pseudocode (Macro Generation Engine - Simplified):**

```
function generate_macro(application_name, ui_context, predicted_input):
  rules = load_rules(application_name)

  matching_rules = find_matching_rules(rules, ui_context, predicted_input)

  if matching_rules is empty:
    return null // No applicable macro

  best_rule = select_best_rule(matching_rules) // Prioritize based on confidence/history

  macro_definition = best_rule.macro

  //Macro definition might be a series of keypresses, mouse clicks, and delays
  return macro_definition
```

**4. Data Storage:**

*   **Application Profiles:** Store application-specific settings, macro definitions, prediction models, and usage history.
*   **Macro Library:** A central repository of pre-defined macros for common tasks.

**5. Privacy Considerations:**

*   All data processing is performed locally on the user's device.
*   Data is not uploaded to the cloud.
*   Users have full control over their data and can delete it at any time.
