## Adaptive Signal Spoofing Countermeasure – UAV Swarm Decoy

**Concept:** Implement a proactive countermeasure to GPS/GNSS spoofing attacks by deploying a decoy swarm that mimics the targeted UAV’s flight profile and transmits false signals, overwhelming the attacker and masking the true UAV’s location.

**Specifications:**

**1. Decoy UAV Platform:**

*   **Size/Weight:** Miniature UAVs (approx. 100-200g) optimized for maneuverability and deployment density. Quadcopter configuration preferred.
*   **Power:** High-density battery providing 10-15 minute operational runtime. Rapid recharging/battery swapping capability required.
*   **Communication:** Secure, low-latency mesh network communication between decoy UAVs and the primary UAV.
*   **Payload:** Miniature RF signal generator capable of transmitting spoofed GPS/GNSS signals. Signal strength adjustable.

**2. System Architecture:**

*   **Primary UAV Integration:** The primary UAV monitors its own navigation data (location, heading, altitude, velocity) and communicates this data to the decoy swarm controller.
*   **Decoy Swarm Controller:** A dedicated onboard or ground-based processor manages the decoy swarm’s behavior. This includes:
    *   Receiving real-time telemetry from the primary UAV.
    *   Calculating the optimal formation and flight profiles for the decoy swarm.
    *   Assigning individual flight paths and signal transmission parameters to each decoy UAV.
*   **Threat Detection:** Implementation of a spoofing detection algorithm on the primary UAV. Upon detection, the system activates the decoy swarm deployment sequence.

**3. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Baseline Establishment:** Primary UAV establishes a normal flight profile.
2.  **Spoofing Detection:** The onboard algorithm identifies anomalous navigation data indicative of a spoofing attack.
3.  **Decoy Deployment:** A container (integrated into the primary UAV or a separate deployment platform) releases a predetermined number of decoy UAVs.
4.  **Swarm Formation:** The decoy swarm controller directs the decoy UAVs to form a cloud around the primary UAV, mimicking its movements and flight characteristics.
5.  **Signal Emission:** Each decoy UAV transmits spoofed GPS/GNSS signals, creating a confusing and inaccurate navigation environment for the attacker. The signal strength and frequency are dynamically adjusted based on the primary UAV’s position and the attacker’s estimated location (if available).
6.  **Dynamic Adaptation:** The swarm controller continuously monitors the primary UAV’s position and adjusts the decoy swarm’s formation and signal transmission parameters to maintain a convincing facade.
7.  **Safe Return/Recovery:** Upon threat neutralization or mission completion, the decoy swarm returns to a designated recovery location or self-destructs (depending on operational requirements).

**4. Pseudocode (Swarm Controller):**

```
// Initialize swarm parameters (number of decoys, formation type, signal parameters)

loop:
    // Receive telemetry from primary UAV (location, heading, velocity)
    primary_data = receive_telemetry()

    // Calculate optimal decoy positions and velocities based on primary UAV data
    decoy_positions, decoy_velocities = calculate_swarm_positions(primary_data)

    // Assign flight paths to individual decoys
    for each decoy in swarm:
        send_flight_path(decoy, decoy_positions[decoy], decoy_velocities[decoy])

    // Generate and transmit spoofed GPS/GNSS signals
    for each decoy in swarm:
        send_spoofed_signal(decoy, primary_data.location)

    // Monitor for threat neutralization (e.g., loss of spoofing signal)
    if threat_neutralized():
        return_swarm()
        break
```

**5. Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Powered Swarm Behavior:** Implement machine learning algorithms to optimize swarm formation and signal transmission strategies based on real-time threat assessment and environmental conditions.
*   **Multi-Spectral Deception:** Integrate other deceptive technologies, such as radar reflectors or visual decoys, to further confuse the attacker.
*   **Autonomous Swarm Recovery:** Develop a fully autonomous recovery system that allows the decoy swarm to return to base without human intervention.
*   **Jamming Resistance:** Design the communication links between the primary UAV and the decoy swarm to be resistant to jamming.
