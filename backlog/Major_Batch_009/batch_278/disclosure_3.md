## Adaptive Audio Beaconing – Device-to-Device Resilience

**Concept:** Expand the fallback audio functionality into a localized, peer-to-peer network for critical information dissemination even without *any* network connectivity, leveraging the device's microphone/speaker array as both receiver and transmitter.  Essentially, devices become ad-hoc beacons for each other.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing device microphone/speaker arrays utilized.
    *   Low-power, short-range acoustic communication module (optional hardware add-on for optimized performance, but designed to function with existing components).
*   **Software – Core Logic:**
    *   **Beacon Mode:**  Devices periodically broadcast a short “status beacon” – a digitally encoded audio signal containing minimal information (e.g., "Operational", "Low Battery", "Emergency").
    *   **Listening Mode:** Devices constantly (low-power) monitor for beacons from nearby devices.  Prioritized by device ID/association (user-defined groups/rooms).
    *   **Priority Leveling:** Beacon content is tiered. Tier 1: critical alerts (fire, medical). Tier 2: status updates (device online/offline, low battery). Tier 3: contextual information (e.g., "Front Door Unlocked").
    *   **Collision Avoidance:** Implement a time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme for beacon transmission to minimize audio collisions. Devices register a transmission slot.  Randomized backoff if slot is occupied.
    *   **Audio Encoding:**  Employ robust, noise-tolerant audio encoding scheme (e.g., Frequency-Shift Keying - FSK, Chirp Spread Spectrum) for reliable communication in noisy environments.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:**  Device adjusts beacon transmission/reception based on environmental conditions (ambient noise levels) and proximity to other devices.

*   **Software –  Integration with Existing System:**
    *   Existing cloud-based control service dictates initial beacon configurations (priority levels, content, transmission frequency).
    *   Local device stores a ‘seed’ of fallback audio content.  Cloud service can push updates when connectivity is available.
    *   If cloud connectivity is lost *and* a critical event occurs (detected locally – e.g., smoke alarm), the device attempts to transmit a beacon.
    *   Receiving devices interpret the beacon, synthesize audio, and relay the message verbally or through visual alerts.
    *   Devices prioritize messages based on proximity and user preferences.

*   **Pseudocode (Beacon Transmission):**

    ```
    FUNCTION transmitBeacon()
    {
        IF networkConnection == FALSE
        {
            priority = getPriority() //Based on event type
            message = getMessage()  //Based on event type
            encodedMessage = encodeAudio(message)
            SELECT transmissionSlot()  //TDMA slot selection
            TRANSMIT encodedMessage THROUGH speaker
            LOG transmissionTime
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Pseudocode (Beacon Reception):**

    ```
    FUNCTION receiveBeacons()
    {
        WHILE (TRUE)
        {
            audioSignal = RECEIVE audio FROM microphone
            decodedSignal = decodeAudio(audioSignal)
            IF (decodedSignal != NULL)
            {
                IF (priority(decodedSignal) > ignoreThreshold)
                {
                    playAudio(decodedSignal)
                    //Visual Alert
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Home security (alert neighbors during power outage).
*   Emergency situations (disaster relief, evacuation).
*   Accessibility (assistive technology for visually/hearing impaired).
*   Smart agriculture (remote sensor data dissemination).
