## Secure Cross-Application Data Completion & Validation

**Concept:** Leverage the bootstrapping authentication framework to create a system where data entry *begun* in one application can be *completed & validated* in another, even across different devices, with strong security guarantees. This is beyond simple data sharing; it's about a unified data lifecycle managed through the authentication service.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Fragment Generation & Encryption:**

*   When a user initiates a data entry process (e.g., filling out a financial form) within an application (App A), the application *doesn't* capture the entire dataset at once. It breaks the data into logical *fragments*.
*   Each fragment is encrypted using a key derived from the user's authenticated session *and* a fragment-specific identifier. This ensures both confidentiality and integrity.
*   App A sends a "Data Fragment Available" notification (via the authentication service) including the encrypted fragment and its identifier to a designated "Completion Service."

**2. Completion Service & Device Discovery:**

*   The Completion Service is a component managed by the authentication service.
*   When a user switches to another device (Device B) or application (App B), App B registers with the Completion Service, advertising its capabilities (e.g., "Can complete financial forms").
*   The Completion Service identifies any available fragments associated with the user and determines if App B can process them.

**3. Secure Fragment Transfer & Completion:**

*   If App B can process the fragment, the Completion Service initiates a secure transfer. *Crucially*, the transfer isn't direct. It happens *through* the authentication service, leveraging the established trust.
*   App B decrypts the fragment using the same key derivation process (user session + fragment ID).
*   App B presents the data to the user for completion/validation.

**4. Validation & Finalization:**

*   Upon completion, App B generates a digitally signed “Completion Certificate” containing the completed data and a timestamp.
*   This certificate is sent *through* the authentication service back to the original App A (or a designated central storage).
*   App A verifies the signature and timestamp, finalizing the data entry process.

**Pseudocode (Completion Service):**

```
function handleAppRegistration(appID, capabilities):
  registerApp(appID, capabilities)

function handleFragmentAvailable(userID, fragmentID, encryptedFragment):
  storeFragment(userID, fragmentID, encryptedFragment)
  findCompatibleApp(userID)

function findCompatibleApp(userID):
  for app in registeredApps:
    if app.capabilities contains needed capability:
      sendFragmentToApp(app, userID, fragmentID)
      return

function sendFragmentToApp(app, userID, fragmentID):
  # Retrieve fragment
  fragment = retrieveFragment(userID, fragmentID)

  # Authenticate app's request for fragment
  if isAuthenticated(app):
    # Send fragment to app
    sendSecureMessage(app, fragment)

function handleCompletionCertificate(app, certificate):
  # Verify certificate signature and timestamp
  if isValidCertificate(certificate):
    # Forward certificate to originating application
    forwardCertificate(certificate)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Data is never fully stored on a single device.
*   **Seamless User Experience:** Enables cross-device data completion.
*   **Flexible Workflows:** Supports diverse application ecosystems.
*   **Improved Data Integrity:**  Digital signatures and timestamps ensure non-repudiation.
