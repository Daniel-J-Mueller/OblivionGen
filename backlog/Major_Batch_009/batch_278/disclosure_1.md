## Dynamic Media ‘Skinning’ with Contextual Keys

**Concept:** Expand the core key-based access model to enable dynamically altering media content based on user context *after* initial decryption, and without re-encryption or full re-download. This is achieved by layering “skin” data – visual/auditory alterations – encrypted with a key derived from the *current* user context, applied on-device.

**Specs:**

1.  **Media Format Extension:** Extend supported media formats (e.g., EPUB, MP4) to include designated “skin” layers. Skin layers contain alteration data – replacement images, adjusted audio tracks, modified text styling – and a metadata block indicating the key derivation parameters.

2.  **Contextual Key Derivation:** The device maintains a constantly updating “context vector” comprised of:
    *   Location (GPS/Network)
    *   Time of Day
    *   Device Usage History (most frequently accessed content types)
    *   User Profile (explicit preferences, inferred demographics)
    *   Environmental Sensors (ambient light, noise level)

    The “skin key” is generated by hashing the current context vector, user account secret, and a salt unique to the specific media item.

3.  **On-Device Skin Application:**
    *   Upon opening media, the device decrypts the core content using the established voucher key system.
    *   It then retrieves the skin metadata.
    *   Using the current context vector, it derives the skin key.
    *   The skin key decrypts the skin layer data.
    *   The device applies the decrypted skin layer alterations to the core content *before* rendering.

4.  **Dynamic Skin Updates:** The device periodically (e.g., every 5-15 minutes) re-derives the skin key and re-applies the skin layer, allowing for context-sensitive alterations without re-downloading the entire media item. This update can be triggered by significant changes in the context vector (e.g., entering a new location).

5. **Skin Layer Packaging:** Define a standard format for skin layers. This will allow skin creators to develop and distribute skins. This could be a metadata-driven instruction set.

**Pseudocode (Skin Application Logic):**

```
FUNCTION ApplySkin(mediaItem, userAccountSecret, contextVector):
  coreContent = DecryptMedia(mediaItem, voucherKey) // Existing decryption
  skinMetadata = ExtractSkinMetadata(mediaItem)

  IF skinMetadata exists:
    skinKey = Hash(contextVector, userAccountSecret, skinMetadata.salt)
    skinLayer = DecryptSkinLayer(skinMetadata.layerData, skinKey)
    alteredContent = ApplySkinAlterations(coreContent, skinLayer)
    RETURN alteredContent
  ELSE:
    RETURN coreContent // No skin applied
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Personalized Storytelling:** Adapt the narrative based on user location (e.g., a mystery novel with location-specific clues), time of day (e.g., a horror story with heightened tension at night), or emotional state (inferred from usage patterns).
*   **Immersive Audiobooks:** Dynamically adjust background music or sound effects based on the user's environment (e.g., adding city ambience when the user is in an urban area).
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Modify the difficulty or presentation of educational content based on the user’s progress and learning style.
*   **Dynamic Advertising/Sponsorship:** Overlay contextually relevant advertisements or sponsorship messages within media content (handled similarly to skin layers).
