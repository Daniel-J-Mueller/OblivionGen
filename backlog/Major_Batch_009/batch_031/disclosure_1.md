**Adaptive Data 'Weather' Forecasting & Proactive Remediation**

**Core Concept:** Extend the data quality monitoring to incorporate predictive analytics, framing data health not as a static assessment, but as a dynamic "weather" system. This allows for *proactive* remediation before quality thresholds are breached, and enables a risk-based prioritization of data cleansing efforts.

**System Specs:**

*   **Data Weather Model:**
    *   Input: All data metrics from the existing patent (usage, importance, cost of replacement). Add: rate of change of these metrics (delta values), historical data quality events (type, severity, resolution time), external event correlation (e.g., marketing campaign launch, system upgrade).
    *   Algorithm: Time series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM neural networks) to predict future data quality deviations.  Develop separate models for different data segments/types. Output: Probability distribution of data quality scores over a defined time horizon (e.g., next 24 hours, week).
    *   Severity Mapping:  Establish a "data weather severity index" â€“ analogous to hurricane categories. Assign severity levels (e.g., "Healthy", "Watch", "Warning", "Critical") based on the forecasted probability of thresholds being breached.

*   **Proactive Remediation Engine:**
    *   Action Library: Define a catalog of automated remediation actions, categorized by severity level and data type. Examples:
        *   *Level 1 (Healthy):*  No action. Continuous monitoring.
        *   *Level 2 (Watch):* Increased monitoring frequency. Trigger automated data profiling to identify potential issues.
        *   *Level 3 (Warning):*  Automated data cleansing rules (e.g., standardization, deduplication) applied to affected data segments.  Alert data stewards.
        *   *Level 4 (Critical):*  Automated data rollback to a known good state.  Full data audit initiated.  Escalate to executive team.
    *   Policy Engine:  Configure policies that map forecasted severity levels to specific remediation actions.  Allow for customization based on data importance and cost of replacement.
    *   Feedback Loop:  Monitor the effectiveness of remediation actions.  Adjust policies and algorithms based on real-world results.

*   **Risk-Based Prioritization:**
    *   Combine predicted severity with data importance scores.  Generate a "Data Risk Score" for each data segment.
    *   Prioritize data cleansing and remediation efforts based on Data Risk Score.  Focus resources on the most critical data assets.

**Pseudocode (Policy Engine):**

```
FUNCTION apply_policy(data_segment, forecasted_severity, data_importance, cost_of_replacement)
  IF forecasted_severity == "Healthy"
    RETURN "No Action"
  ELSE IF forecasted_severity == "Watch"
    RETURN "Increased Monitoring + Data Profiling"
  ELSE IF forecasted_severity == "Warning"
    IF data_importance > 8 AND cost_of_replacement > 5
      RETURN "Automated Cleansing (Standardization, Deduplication)"
    ELSE
      RETURN "Alert Data Steward"
    ENDIF
  ELSE IF forecasted_severity == "Critical"
    RETURN "Automated Rollback + Full Data Audit"
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Scalable cloud infrastructure for time series data storage and analysis.
*   High-performance computing for running forecasting models.
*   Real-time data streaming capabilities.
