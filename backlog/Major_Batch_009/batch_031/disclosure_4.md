## Dynamic Perspective Stitching for Shared Device Videoconferencing

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-camera array (minimum 3, ideally 4-6) integrated into/around the shared computing device’s display. Cameras must support synchronized capture. Standard processing unit (CPU/GPU) capable of real-time video processing.
*   **Software:** Core application module, camera calibration module, perspective analysis module, video stitching module, user interface (UI) module.
*   **Connectivity:**  High bandwidth internal communication between cameras & processing unit. Standard videoconferencing API integration (Zoom, Teams, etc.).

**Innovation Description:**

The system aims to create individualized video feeds for each device-sharing participant *as if* they are each being viewed head-on by the remote participant, even though they are sharing a single device and may be positioned at varying angles. This is achieved via dynamic perspective stitching.

**Operation:**

1.  **Calibration:** Upon system startup, a calibration sequence is initiated. Each camera captures a test pattern (or utilizes a user-guided process) to determine its intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. This establishes the spatial relationship between each camera and the shared display.
2.  **Participant Detection & Tracking:**  The existing audio/video analysis from the core patent is used to detect the presence of multiple participants.  Facial tracking (enhanced with depth sensing from cameras if available) continuously monitors each participant’s head pose and position.
3.  **Perspective Transformation:** For each remote participant, the system determines the "ideal" viewpoint for each device-sharing participant. This is based on their detected position, head pose, and a calculated ‘comfort zone’ to prevent overly distorted views. Each camera’s feed is then digitally transformed (warped/rotated) to *simulate* a head-on view of the respective participant from the remote participant’s perspective.
4.  **Stitching & Blending:** The transformed video feeds are seamlessly stitched together. A blending algorithm minimizes visible seams and creates a natural-looking composite image.  Priority is given to the transformed regions to ensure the simulated "head-on" view is prominent.
5.  **Transmission:** The composite image is then transmitted as a single video stream to the remote participant. 
6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The entire process is continuously repeated, dynamically adjusting to changes in participant position and head pose.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
//For Each Participant in Shared Device
{
    //Get Participant Position & Head Pose from Tracking
    participantPosition = GetParticipantPosition();
    participantHeadPose = GetParticipantHeadPose();

    //Calculate Ideal Viewpoint from Remote Participant's Perspective
    idealViewpoint = CalculateIdealViewpoint(participantPosition, participantHeadPose);

    //For Each Camera
    {
        //Transform Camera Feed to Simulate Head-On View from Ideal Viewpoint
        transformedFeed = TransformVideoFeed(cameraFeed, idealViewpoint);
    }

    //Blend Transformed Feeds to Create Composite Image
    compositeImage = BlendVideoFeeds(transformedFeeds);

    //Transmit Composite Image as Single Video Stream
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Powered Pose Correction:** Utilize AI to subtly correct participant poses in the transformed video to improve realism.
*   **Background Replacement:**  Replace the shared device’s background with a virtual environment to further enhance the individualized experience.
*   **Individual Lighting Adjustment:** Simulate individualized lighting for each participant in the transformed video.
*   **Depth Sensing Integration:** Incorporate depth sensors to improve participant tracking and pose estimation.
