**Adaptive Multi-Modal Notification System**

**Concept:** Extend the asynchronous communication concept to encompass more than just voice. Create a system that dynamically selects the *best* communication modality (voice, text, visual cue, haptic feedback) based on context, device capabilities, user preferences, and environmental factors.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Module: Modality Selector.** This module receives input data regarding:
    *   Device Capabilities: (Speaker present, screen resolution, haptic engine, connectivity).
    *   User Profile: (Preferred communication modalities for different contexts - e.g., 'voice for urgent alerts, text for informational updates').
    *   Environmental Context: (Noise level detected via microphone, ambient light level, detected activity – e.g., ‘user is driving’, ‘user is in a meeting’).
    *   Communication Priority: (Urgent, Normal, Low).
    *   Device State: (Screen on/off, volume level, do not disturb mode).

*   **Communication Modalities:**
    *   Voice: Standard voice message delivery.
    *   Text: Standard text message delivery.
    *   Visual Cue: Utilizing device screen to display icons, animations, or short video clips. Brightness and color dynamically adjust based on ambient light.
    *   Haptic Feedback: Utilizing haptic engine to generate unique vibration patterns. Intensity and pattern adjust based on communication priority and user preference.
    *   Augmented Reality Overlay: (For AR-capable devices) Projecting visual notifications onto the user’s view of the real world.

*   **Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm:**

    ```pseudocode
    function selectModality(deviceCapabilities, userProfile, environmentalContext, priority, deviceState):
        modalityScore = {}

        // Assign scores based on factors
        if (deviceCapabilities.hasSpeaker and userProfile.prefersVoiceForUrgent and priority == "Urgent"):
            modalityScore["Voice"] += 5
        if (deviceCapabilities.hasScreen and userProfile.prefersVisualForNotifications):
            modalityScore["Visual"] += 4
        if (environmentalContext.noiseLevel > threshold and userProfile.prefersVisualWhenNoisy):
            modalityScore["Visual"] += 3
        if (deviceState.doNotDisturb and userProfile.prefersHapticForDoNotDisturb):
            modalityScore["Haptic"] += 5
        // Add more rules as needed

        // Select modality with highest score
        bestModality = argmax(modalityScore)

        return bestModality
    ```

*   **Adaptive Learning:** System should learn user preferences over time. Implement a feedback mechanism (user can explicitly rate the appropriateness of a modality for a given notification). Use this feedback to refine the scoring algorithm.

*   **Multi-Modality Combination:** In some cases, combine multiple modalities for greater effectiveness (e.g., voice + visual cue). The system should intelligently determine when and how to combine modalities.

*   **API Integration:** Provide a well-defined API for developers to integrate the adaptive notification system into their applications.
