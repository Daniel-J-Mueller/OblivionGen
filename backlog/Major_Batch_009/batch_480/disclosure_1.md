## Personalized Acoustic Environment Sculpting

**Concept:** Leverage the core frequency-domain separation techniques outlined in the patent to create a dynamic, personalized acoustic environment for the user, independent of the source audio. Instead of *removing* echo/speech, selectively *enhance* or modify specific frequency bands based on user preference or detected emotional state.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (4-8 mics) for beamforming and spatial audio capture.
    *   High-fidelity loudspeaker system with independent channel control.
    *   Biofeedback sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance) for emotional state detection (optional, for advanced features).
    *   Processing unit capable of real-time FFT/iFFT operations.

*   **Software Modules:**
    1.  **Audio Capture & Processing:**
        *   Receives audio input from microphone array.
        *   Performs FFT to convert audio to frequency domain.
        *   Applies beamforming to isolate individual sound sources (if desired).
        *   Identifies frequency bands containing speech and music (using correlation analysis as in the patent).

    2.  **User Profile & Preference Engine:**
        *   Stores user-defined acoustic profiles (e.g., "Calming", "Energetic", "Focus").
        *   Each profile defines gain curves for specific frequency bands.  Example: "Calming" might boost low frequencies (bass) and attenuate high frequencies.
        *   User interface for creating and editing profiles.
        *   Integration with biofeedback sensors to dynamically adjust profiles based on detected emotional state (e.g., increase calming frequencies when stress is detected).

    3.  **Frequency Band Manipulation:**
        *   Applies user-defined or dynamically calculated gain curves to individual frequency bands.
        *   Implements advanced signal processing techniques for frequency band manipulation:
            *   **Spectral shaping:** Smoothly adjust the frequency response.
            *   **Harmonic generation:** Add subtle harmonics to enhance warmth or clarity.
            *   **Noise sculpting:**  Selectively attenuate or amplify noise in specific bands.
        *   Utilizes the patent’s mask data generation as a core component for selective frequency manipulation. The “first mask data” isn’t used to *remove* – it’s used to *isolate* for selective processing.

    4.  **Spatial Audio Rendering:**
        *   Utilizes beamforming and spatial audio rendering techniques to direct processed audio to specific locations in the room.
        *   Creates a personalized “acoustic bubble” around the user, where the acoustic environment is tailored to their preferences.

    5.  **Real-Time Processing Pipeline:**
        *   Optimized for low-latency, real-time processing.
        *   Modular architecture for easy expansion and modification.

*   **Pseudocode (Core Processing Loop):**

    ```
    WHILE audio_input_available:
        audio_data = capture_audio()
        frequency_data = fft(audio_data)
        speech_mask = generate_speech_mask(frequency_data) // based on patent correlation
        music_mask = generate_music_mask(frequency_data) // based on patent correlation

        user_profile = get_user_profile()
        frequency_bands = user_profile.get_frequency_bands()

        FOR each frequency_band IN frequency_bands:
            gain = frequency_band.get_gain()
            start_frequency = frequency_band.get_start_frequency()
            end_frequency = frequency_band.get_end_frequency()

            FOR i FROM start_frequency TO end_frequency:
                frequency_data[i] = frequency_data[i] * gain

        processed_audio = ifft(frequency_data)
        output_audio(processed_audio)
    ```

*   **Applications:**
    *   Personalized music listening experience.
    *   Enhanced focus and productivity.
    *   Stress reduction and relaxation.
    *   Immersive gaming and virtual reality.
    *   Accessibility features for individuals with hearing impairments.
