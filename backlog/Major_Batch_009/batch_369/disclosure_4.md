**Adaptive Compression Granularity via Content-Aware Chunking**

**Concept:** Extend the existing compression system to analyze incoming data *before* compression, breaking it into variable-sized "chunks" based on content similarity and entropy. This allows applying different compression techniques – or varying parameters *within* a technique – to each chunk, maximizing compression efficiency. The core idea builds on the existing rules-based/ML selection, but shifts the granularity from the *entire* data stream to sub-streams.

**Specs:**

*   **Pre-Compression Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Raw data stream.
    *   Process:
        1.  **Content Similarity Mapping:** Employ a rolling hash or similar technique to identify segments of data with high internal similarity.  This creates initial "candidate chunks."
        2.  **Entropy Calculation:**  Compute the entropy of each candidate chunk.  Higher entropy suggests less compressibility with standard methods; lower entropy suggests potential for strong compression.
        3.  **Chunk Boundary Adjustment:**  Refine chunk boundaries based on both similarity *and* entropy.  Allow splitting/merging of chunks to optimize.  A cost function (explained below) governs this.
*   **Cost Function:**  `Cost = (Entropy * Weight_Entropy) + (Chunk_Size_Deviation * Weight_Size) + (Boundary_Adjustment_Penalty * Weight_Penalty)`
    *   `Entropy`: Entropy of the chunk.
    *   `Chunk_Size_Deviation`: Deviation of the chunk size from a target size (configurable parameter).
    *   `Boundary_Adjustment_Penalty`: Penalty for splitting a highly similar segment.
    *   `Weight_Entropy`, `Weight_Size`, `Weight_Penalty`: Configurable weights to tune behavior.
*   **Compression Strategy Selector (Enhanced):**
    *   Input: Chunk + Calculated Entropy/Similarity Metrics.
    *   Process:
        1.  Utilize existing ML models to determine optimal compression technique *per chunk*.
        2.  Introduce a new "Pass-Through" option for chunks with extremely low entropy/high similarity, indicating no compression is needed.  This reduces processing overhead.
        3.  Allow for parameter variation *within* a chosen technique (e.g., different dictionary sizes for Lempel-Ziv variants).
*   **Compression Pipeline:**
    *   Process: For each chunk:
        1.  Select compression technique and parameters based on selector output.
        2.  Compress chunk.
        3.  Store metadata associated with chunk (technique used, parameters, original size, compressed size).
*   **Decompression Pipeline:**
    *   Process:
        1.  Read metadata for each chunk.
        2.  Decompress chunk using appropriate technique and parameters.
        3.  Reassemble original data stream.

**Pseudocode (Pre-Compression Analysis):**

```
function analyze_data(data_stream):
  candidate_chunks = identify_similar_segments(data_stream)
  for chunk in candidate_chunks:
    chunk.entropy = calculate_entropy(chunk.data)
  refined_chunks = refine_chunk_boundaries(candidate_chunks)
  return refined_chunks

function refine_chunk_boundaries(candidate_chunks):
  # Implement cost function and optimization algorithm (e.g., dynamic programming)
  # Adjust chunk boundaries to minimize cost
  # Return refined chunks
```

**Innovation Notes:**

The key difference is the shift to *variable-sized* chunks and the cost function optimization. Existing systems assume a consistent stream. This adapts to data *structure* rather than treating everything as a uniform block. The “Pass-Through” option dramatically reduces overhead for highly redundant data, and allows further opportunities to optimize. The increased metadata overhead is mitigated by the potential gains in compression ratio and reduced processing load for similar blocks.
