## Thermal Gradient Battery Array for Modular Devices

**Concept:** Expand the thermal management system beyond a single battery and IR LED pairing to a modular array, creating a dynamically adjustable thermal gradient across multiple batteries to optimize performance and lifespan based on individual discharge rates and environmental conditions.

**Specifications:**

*   **Modular Battery Blocks:** Utilize multiple, smaller, rechargeable battery cells (Li-ion preferred) housed in thermally conductive blocks. Each block acts as a discrete unit for thermal and electrical connection.
*   **Distributed Heat Sources:** Integrate multiple IR LED arrays (or other heat-generating components) distributed across the deviceâ€™s PCB.  Each array is associated with one or more battery blocks.
*   **Micro-Heatsink Network:**  A network of micro-heatsinks, constructed from high thermal conductivity materials (copper or graphite composite), interconnects each battery block. These act as pathways for heat redistribution.
*   **Thermoelectric Modules (TEMs):** Incorporate miniature TEMs (Peltier devices) between battery blocks and the micro-heatsink network. These allow for *active* heat transfer - both directing heat *to* colder batteries and removing heat from warmer ones.
*   **Thermal Gradient Control System:**
    *   **Sensors:** Each battery block includes multiple temperature sensors (thermistors) and voltage sensors.
    *   **Processor:** A dedicated processor monitors sensor data in real-time.
    *   **Control Algorithm:** A PID control algorithm (or more advanced machine learning model) calculates optimal TEM activation patterns to maintain a target thermal gradient across the battery array. The gradient is adjustable based on device usage patterns and ambient temperature.
*   **Dynamic Heat Source Modulation:**  The processor controls the power output of each heat-generating component (e.g., IR LED array) independently, further fine-tuning the thermal distribution.  This allows for targeted heating of specific batteries based on their discharge rate.
*   **Software Interface:**  A software interface exposes control parameters for the thermal gradient, allowing users (or automated systems) to prioritize battery lifespan, performance, or a balance of both.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Loop):**

```
// Initialize variables
target_gradient = [temp_1, temp_2, temp_3, ...]; //Desired temps for each battery
current_temps = [];

LOOP:
    // Read battery temps
    current_temps = read_battery_temps();

    // Calculate temp differences
    temp_diffs = current_temps - target_gradient;

    //For each battery block:
    FOR i = 0 TO num_batteries:
        IF temp_diffs[i] > threshold: //Battery too cold
            Activate TEM to transfer heat from warmer blocks
            Increase power to associated heat source (if available)
        ELSE IF temp_diffs[i] < -threshold: //Battery too hot
            Activate TEM to transfer heat to colder blocks
        END IF
    END FOR

    //Apply dynamic heat source modulation based on overall system load

    //Delay for next iteration
END LOOP
```
