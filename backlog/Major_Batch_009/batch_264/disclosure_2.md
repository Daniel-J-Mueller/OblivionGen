## Adaptive Session Key Distribution via Distributed Hash Table

**Concept:** Leverage a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to dynamically distribute and manage session keys, decoupling key exchange from specific transport mechanisms and enhancing resilience. This extends the idea of multi-transport sessions by allowing session resumption even if initial transport fails.

**Specification:**

**I. System Architecture**

*   **DHT Network:** A persistent DHT network (e.g., Kademlia, Chord) is established and maintained. Nodes in this network are independent of communicating applications.
*   **Key Exchange Coordinator (KEC):** A dedicated service responsible for initial key exchange and DHT registration. Can be implemented as a cluster for scalability and redundancy.
*   **Application Components:** The first and second applications (as described in the patent) are modified to interact with the KEC and DHT.

**II. Operational Flow**

1.  **Initial Handshake:**
    *   Application 1 initiates a standard TLS handshake with Application 2 via a primary transport mechanism (e.g., TCP).
    *   During the handshake, Application 1 and Application 2 establish a shared secret.
    *   Application 1 contacts the KEC, providing the shared secret (or a derivative thereof) and a unique session identifier.
    *   The KEC calculates a session key from the shared secret and hashes the session identifier to determine key storage locations within the DHT.
    *   The KEC stores the session key, encrypted with a DHT-wide public key, at multiple DHT nodes based on the hash of the session ID. The KEC returns DHT node addresses to both Application 1 and Application 2.

2.  **Subsequent Communication:**
    *   Applications 1 and 2 can now communicate using the session key over *any* transport mechanism. 
    *   If a transport failure occurs (as covered in the patent), either application can retrieve the session key from the DHT using the session identifier.
    *   Applications do not need to renegotiate the entire TLS session. They simply resume communication with the retrieved session key.

3.  **Key Rotation and Expiration:**
    *   The KEC manages key rotation based on pre-defined intervals or traffic volume.
    *   The KEC also enforces key expiration, removing outdated keys from the DHT.
    *   Applications are notified of key updates and refresh the key as needed.

**III. Pseudocode (Application 1 â€“ Key Retrieval)**

```
function retrieveSessionKey(sessionID):
  // Calculate DHT node addresses based on sessionID
  dhtAddresses = hash(sessionID) % DHT_NODE_COUNT

  // Attempt to retrieve key from DHT nodes
  for each address in dhtAddresses:
    try:
      key = DHT_GET(address, sessionID)
      if key != NULL:
        return key
    except DHT_ERROR:
      continue

  // Key not found in DHT
  return NULL
```

**IV. Data Structures**

*   **DHT Key:** {sessionID: String, key: EncryptedKey, timestamp: Long}
*   **Application Message:** {sessionID: String, message: String, encryptedMessage: String}

**V. Considerations**

*   **DHT Security:** The security of the DHT network is crucial. Strong encryption and access control mechanisms are required.
*   **Scalability:** The DHT network must be scalable to handle a large number of sessions.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The DHT network must be fault-tolerant to ensure that session keys are always available.
*   **Synchronization:** Efficient synchronization mechanisms are needed to manage key updates and expirations.
