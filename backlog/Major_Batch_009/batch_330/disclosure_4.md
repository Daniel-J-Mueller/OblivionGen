## Adaptive Request Sharding with Predictive Congestion

**Concept:** Extend the sideline queue concept by proactively *sharding* requests based on predicted congestion at the service endpoint *before* transmission, distributing these shards across multiple, potentially geographically diverse, service endpoint instances. This reduces the impact of endpoint-specific throttling and leverages available capacity more efficiently.

**Specs:**

**1. Request Profiler Module:**

*   **Input:** Incoming customer event data (including customer ID, service request type, request payload size, historical performance data for similar requests/customers).
*   **Process:**  Employ a machine learning model (trained on historical data including endpoint load, latency, and throttle responses) to *predict* the probability of throttling for the current request at each available service endpoint.  Also predict *estimated* processing time.
*   **Output:**  A "Shard Profile" containing:
    *   `endpoint_affinity_list`: Ordered list of service endpoint instances (e.g., `[endpoint_A, endpoint_B, endpoint_C]`) ranked by predicted throttling probability (lowest probability first).
    *   `shard_count`: Number of shards to create for the request (determined by request size and predicted congestion – larger requests/higher congestion = more shards).
    *   `shard_size`: Target size for each shard.
    *   `request_hash`: Cryptographic hash of the original request payload for reassembly.

**2. Request Sharder Module:**

*   **Input:** Original request payload, `Shard Profile`.
*   **Process:** Split the original request payload into `shard_count` equally sized (or as close as possible) shards.  Append metadata to each shard:
    *   `shard_index`: Integer indicating the shard's position in the original request (e.g., 0, 1, 2...).
    *   `total_shards`: Total number of shards.
    *   `request_hash`:  The `request_hash` from the `Shard Profile`.
    *   `customer_ID`: Customer Identification information.
*   **Output:** A stream of individual shard payloads, each containing the shard data and metadata.

**3. Adaptive Routing & Transmission Module:**

*   **Input:** Stream of shard payloads, `endpoint_affinity_list`.
*   **Process:** Distribute shards across the `endpoint_affinity_list` in a round-robin or weighted-round-robin fashion (weighting based on predicted capacity).  Each shard is sent to a *different* service endpoint instance.
*   **Transmission:** Utilize a reliable transport protocol (e.g., TCP) to ensure shard delivery. Implement automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.

**4.  Shard Reassembler Module (at Service Endpoint):**

*   **Input:** Shard payloads.
*   **Process:**
    *   Validate shard metadata (check `shard_index`, `total_shards`, `request_hash`).
    *   Buffer shards in order of `shard_index`.
    *   Once all shards are received, reassemble the original request payload.
    *   Forward the reassembled request to the backend processing logic.
*   **Output:**  Reassembled original request payload.

**5. Failure Handling & Redundancy:**

*   If a shard transmission fails (after retries), mark the shard as lost.
*   Implement a "shard regeneration" mechanism:  The originating system can re-shard and re-transmit the lost shard.
*   If a critical number of shards are lost, the entire request is marked as failed.
*   Consider implementing a “shadow shard” strategy:  Duplicate a small percentage of shards and send them to different endpoints for increased resilience.



**Pseudocode (Simplified - Adaptive Routing Module):**

```pseudocode
function routeShards(shardStream, endpointList):
  for each shard in shardStream:
    endpoint = endpointList[shard.shard_index % length(endpointList)]  //Distribute shards round robin
    transmit(shard, endpoint)
```

This adaptive sharding approach allows for proactive congestion avoidance, leveraging multiple service endpoints to distribute load and increase overall system throughput and resilience. It's significantly more robust than simply queuing requests when throttling occurs, as it actively *prevents* congestion at the endpoint level.
