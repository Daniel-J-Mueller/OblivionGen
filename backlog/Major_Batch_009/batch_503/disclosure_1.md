## Adaptive Tensor Sharding with Dynamic Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the existing sub-operation distribution across computing engines by introducing *dynamic* sharding granularity. Instead of pre-defined portions of tensors being assigned to sub-operations, the system analyzes data dependencies *during* execution and adjusts the sharding on-the-fly. This allows for optimized resource utilization, particularly with irregular or sparse tensors.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing multi-engine architecture as described in the provided patent. Add a lightweight, dedicated "Sharding Controller" unit per engine. This unit doesn't perform computation, but manages data flow and sharding adjustments.
*   **Software - Data Dependency Analyzer:** A runtime component that analyzes the data flow graph of the neural network. It identifies dependencies between tensor elements (or blocks) and estimates the computational cost of different sharding strategies. This analysis occurs *before* and *during* execution of each tensor operation.
*   **Sharding Granularity Levels:** Define multiple sharding granularity levels â€“ coarse (entire tensor), medium (blocks/slices), fine (individual elements/sparse blocks).
*   **Dynamic Sharding Algorithm:**

    1.  **Initial Sharding:** Begin with a default sharding strategy (e.g., even distribution of blocks).
    2.  **Dependency Analysis:** The Data Dependency Analyzer identifies critical paths and data dependencies within the tensor operation.
    3.  **Cost Estimation:** Estimate the communication cost and computation load for each engine based on different sharding configurations.
    4.  **Sharding Adjustment:** The Sharding Controller adjusts the sharding configuration based on the cost estimation. This involves:
        *   **Data Movement:** Relocating tensor elements (or blocks) between engines.
        *   **Sub-Operation Reassignment:** Reassigning sub-operations to different engines.
        *   **Synchronization:** Ensuring data consistency and synchronization between engines.
    5.  **Runtime Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the performance and adjust the sharding configuration based on runtime feedback.
*   **Data Format:** Support flexible data formats, including sparse tensors, to maximize the benefits of dynamic sharding.

**Pseudocode (Sharding Controller):**

```
function adjust_sharding(tensor_operation, data_dependency_analyzer, current_sharding):
  cost_estimates = data_dependency_analyzer.estimate_cost(tensor_operation, current_sharding)
  new_sharding = find_optimal_sharding(cost_estimates)

  if new_sharding != current_sharding:
    data_movement_plan = generate_data_movement_plan(current_sharding, new_sharding)
    execute_data_movement(data_movement_plan)
    reassign_suboperations(new_sharding)
    update_current_sharding(new_sharding)

function find_optimal_sharding(cost_estimates):
  // Implement a search algorithm (e.g., simulated annealing, genetic algorithm)
  // to find the sharding configuration with the lowest cost
  return optimal_sharding

function generate_data_movement_plan(current_sharding, new_sharding):
  // Generate a plan for moving tensor elements between engines
  // based on the difference between the current and new sharding
  return data_movement_plan

function execute_data_movement(data_movement_plan):
  // Execute the data movement plan, transferring tensor elements
  // between engines
  pass
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved resource utilization
*   Reduced communication overhead
*   Increased performance with irregular or sparse tensors
*   Adaptability to changing workloads
*   Greater scalability.
