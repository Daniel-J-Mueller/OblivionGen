## Modular Sensory Enclosure - "Chrysalis"

**Concept:** A reconfigurable enclosure utilizing flexible display technology and biofeedback integration to create personalized sensory environments. It builds on the existing collapsible enclosure concept, replacing static diffusion with dynamic, interactive visuals and incorporating physiological data for responsive adaptation.

**Specs:**

*   **Frame:** Collapsible geodesic dome structure fabricated from lightweight, high-strength carbon fiber. Retains the expandable/collapsible functionality of the original patent, but emphasizes structural rigidity in expanded state. Diameter: 2 meters (adjustable via modular segment addition/removal).
*   **Skin:** Composed of interconnected, flexible OLED panels. Resolution: 1920x1080 per panel. Panels are weatherproof and dustproof. Each panel is individually addressable. Modularity allows for panel replacement/repair.
*   **Biofeedback Sensors:** Integrated within the enclosure's base/floor. Sensors include:
    *   Electroencephalography (EEG) – Measures brainwave activity.
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) – Measures skin conductivity (stress/arousal).
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) – Measures heart rate fluctuations (emotional state).
    *   Respiration Rate – Measures breathing pattern.
*   **Control System:** Raspberry Pi 4B or equivalent. Runs custom software for:
    *   Sensor data acquisition and processing.
    *   Visual content generation/selection.
    *   Dynamic content mapping to sensor data.
    *   User interface (tablet/smartphone app).
*   **Lighting:**  Addressable RGB LED strips embedded within the frame and behind the OLED panels. Provides ambient and accent lighting.  Color temperature and intensity adjustable.
*   **Audio:**  Spatial audio system with multiple miniature speakers embedded within the enclosure walls. Supports 3D audio rendering.
*   **Haptic Feedback:**  Integrated vibrotactile transducers within the floor and potentially within select wall panels.  Provides subtle haptic sensations synchronized with visuals and audio.
*   **Air Purification/Aroma Diffuser:** Small HEPA filter and aroma diffuser integrated into the base.  Allows for controlled air quality and scent introduction.
*   **Power:** Wireless charging for portable devices inside the enclosure.  External power supply.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Connect to Biofeedback Sensors
Connect to OLED Panels
Connect to Audio System
Connect to Haptic System

// Main Loop
While (Enclosure is Active) {
  Read Biofeedback Data (EEG, GSR, HRV, Respiration)
  Analyze Biofeedback Data -> Determine User State (Relaxed, Stressed, Focused, etc.)

  // Content Selection/Generation
  If (User State == Relaxed) {
    Visuals = Generate Calming Nature Scene (Ocean Waves, Forest Canopy)
    Audio = Play Ambient Soundscape (Rain, Birds)
    Haptics = Gentle Vibration Patterns
  } Else If (User State == Stressed) {
    Visuals = Generate Abstract Geometric Patterns (Slowly Changing Colors)
    Audio = Play Binaural Beats (Delta/Theta Waves)
    Haptics = Slow, Rhythmic Pulsations
  } Else If (User State == Focused) {
    Visuals = Generate Minimalist Visuals (Solid Colors, Subtle Animations)
    Audio = Play White Noise/Isochronic Tones
    Haptics = Very Low Amplitude Vibration
  } Else {
    // Default Content (User Customizable)
  }

  // Render Content
  Display Visuals on OLED Panels
  Play Audio through Spatial Audio System
  Activate Haptic Feedback System

  // Update Content Dynamically
  Adjust Visuals, Audio, and Haptics based on Real-time Biofeedback Data
}
```

**Adaptations:**

*   **VR/AR Integration:** Add support for head tracking and gesture control to enable immersive VR/AR experiences within the enclosure.
*   **Multi-User Support:**  Implement multi-user biofeedback analysis and content adaptation to create shared sensory experiences.
*   **Therapeutic Applications:**  Develop specialized content and protocols for applications such as stress reduction, pain management, and anxiety relief.
*   **Educational Applications:** Create immersive learning environments for topics such as astronomy, biology, and history.
*    **Personalized lighting**: Integrate circadian rhythm lighting to help adjust sleep schedules.
