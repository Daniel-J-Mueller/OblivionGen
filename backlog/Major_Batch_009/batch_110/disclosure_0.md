## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted User Gaze & Foveated Rendering

**Concept:** Extend the patent's resource optimization by incorporating predicted user gaze data to proactively allocate resources using foveated rendering techniques. Instead of *reacting* to performance data after requests are made, *anticipate* resource needs based on where the user is likely looking.

**Specifications:**

**1. Gaze Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Client-side eye-tracking data (gaze coordinates, pupil dilation, fixation duration) & User behavior data (scroll speed, click patterns, content interaction)
*   **Processing:** Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) – trained on a large dataset of user viewing patterns.  The RNN predicts future gaze coordinates with a configurable prediction horizon (e.g., 100ms - 500ms).  Kalman filtering will smooth the gaze predictions.
*   **Output:** Predicted gaze coordinates (x, y) with confidence score.  A "Gaze Area of Interest" (GAOI) defined as a circular region (radius configurable, default 50 pixels) around the predicted gaze point.

**2. Resource Prioritization Engine:**

*   **Input:** Predicted gaze coordinates, GAOI, Current content layout/DOM, Resource metadata (image resolution, video bitrate, mesh complexity), Bandwidth availability, Client device capabilities (CPU, GPU, memory).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Identify resources (images, videos, 3D models) that fall within the GAOI.
    *   Prioritize these resources for high-quality rendering/transmission.
    *   Reduce the quality/detail of resources outside the GAOI.
    *   Dynamically adjust resource allocation based on bandwidth constraints and client device capabilities.
    *   The system will employ a weighted scoring system.
        *   **Gaze Weight:** 0.6
        *   **Content Importance:** 0.2 (determined by content provider metadata – e.g., hero images vs. background elements)
        *   **Bandwidth Availability:** 0.2
    *   The score will inform resource allocation decisions.

**3.  Foveated Rendering Pipeline:**

*   **Input:** Resource prioritization data, Content to be rendered.
*   **Processing:**
    *   For resources within the GAOI:
        *   Render at full resolution/quality.
        *   Utilize advanced rendering techniques (e.g., ray tracing, anti-aliasing).
    *   For resources outside the GAOI:
        *   Reduce resolution/quality (e.g., lower LOD models, compressed textures).
        *   Employ simpler rendering techniques.
        *   Implement dynamic level-of-detail (LOD) switching.
*   **Output:** Rendered content optimized for perceived visual quality.

**4.  Dynamic Resource Request Manager:**

*   **Input:** Predicted gaze coordinates, Resource prioritization data, Current resource requests.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Adjust the order of resource requests based on predicted gaze direction.  Prioritize resources likely to be viewed soon.
    *   Dynamically request different quality versions of resources based on predicted gaze and bandwidth.
    *   Cache high-quality versions of resources within the GAOI for faster rendering.
*   **Output:** Optimized resource request stream.

**Pseudocode (Resource Request Manager):**

```pseudocode
function optimizeResourceRequests(predictedGaze, resourceList, bandwidth):
  sortedResourceList = sort(resourceList, key=lambda x: distance(x.position, predictedGaze))
  for resource in sortedResourceList:
    if resource.position within predictedGazeAreaOfInterest:
      requestHighQualityVersion(resource)
    else:
      requestLowQualityVersion(resource)
  return optimizedRequestList
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Eye-tracking hardware (integrated or external).
*   Client-side software agent for gaze data capture and processing.
*   Server-side components for managing resource variations and delivery.
*   Machine learning framework for training the gaze prediction model (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Web browser or native application support for foveated rendering.
