## Predictive Data Shadowing & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Leverage access patterns and machine learning to proactively create ‘shadow’ copies of data segments *before* a full restore operation is needed, and dynamically reconstruct data states, significantly reducing restoration time and resource consumption.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Segmentation:**

*   Divide the primary data store into granular segments (e.g., 64KB - 1MB blocks). The segment size is configurable.
*   Each segment is assigned a ‘reconstruction priority’ score initialized to a baseline value.

**2. Access Pattern Monitoring:**

*   Real-time monitoring of all read/write operations at the segment level.
*   Data stored: Timestamp, Segment ID, Operation Type (read/write), Access Count.
*   Access data aggregated into rolling time windows (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week).

**3. Reconstruction Priority Adjustment:**

*   Priority score dynamically adjusted based on access pattern analysis.
*   Formula: `Priority = Baseline + (α * AccessRate) + (β * ChangeRate) - (γ * TimeSinceLastAccess)`
    *   `AccessRate`:  Frequency of access within the current time window.
    *   `ChangeRate`: Rate of modification (writes) within the current time window.
    *   `TimeSinceLastAccess`: Time elapsed since the last access.
    *   α, β, γ: Configurable weighting factors.
*   Segments with high access and change rates receive higher priority.
*   Segments with infrequent access receive lower priority.

**4. Shadow Copy Creation:**

*   A pool of 'shadow' storage is provisioned.
*   Based on priority scores, a background process proactively creates shadow copies of segments.
*   Copies are created incrementally (differential snapshots) to minimize storage overhead.
*   A configurable maximum number of shadow copies per segment is maintained.
*   Shadow copies are versioned (timestamped) to allow reconstruction of specific states.

**5. Reconstruction Process:**

*   When a restore request is received:
    *   Identify the desired restoration point in time.
    *   Attempt to reconstruct the data from existing shadow copies.
    *   If a complete shadow copy is available for the requested time, use it directly.
    *   If not, identify the closest available shadow copies and apply incremental changes (log records) to reconstruct the desired state.
    *   If necessary, fetch missing data from the primary data store.
*   Log records (describing changes to the data) are stored alongside shadow copies.

**6. Predictive Shadowing:**

*   Utilize time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future access patterns.
*   Proactively create shadow copies of segments predicted to have high access rates.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Process):**

```
function reconstructData(restoreTime, segmentId):
  shadowCopies = getShadowCopies(segmentId, restoreTime)

  if shadowCopies is not empty:
    closestCopy = findClosestShadowCopy(shadowCopies, restoreTime)
    if closestCopy.time == restoreTime:
      return closestCopy.data
    else:
      // Apply log records to reconstruct the desired state
      logRecords = getLogRecords(closestCopy.time, restoreTime)
      reconstructedData = applyLogRecords(closestCopy.data, logRecords)
      return reconstructedData
  else:
    // Fetch data from primary data store
    primaryData = fetchFromPrimary(segmentId)
    return primaryData
```

**Storage Considerations:**

*   Differential snapshots minimize storage overhead.
*   Data compression techniques further reduce storage requirements.
*   Tiered storage (e.g., SSD for frequently accessed segments, HDD for infrequently accessed segments) can optimize performance and cost.

**Monitoring and Tuning:**

*   Monitor shadow copy creation rates, storage utilization, and restoration times.
*   Adjust weighting factors (α, β, γ) to optimize performance based on observed access patterns.
*   Dynamically adjust the maximum number of shadow copies per segment based on storage capacity and performance requirements.
