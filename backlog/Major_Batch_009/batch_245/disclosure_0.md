**Dynamic Power Harvesting & Distribution Network**

**Concept:** A self-organizing network of micro-power harvesters integrated with a dynamically adjustable power distribution system, optimized for fluctuating loads and localized energy availability. This builds on the idea of dynamically adjusting current based on power demands, but expands it to a distributed system *creating* the power, not just managing it.

**Specs:**

*   **Harvester Nodes:**
    *   Type: Piezoelectric, thermoelectric, RF energy scavenging, and micro-wind turbines. Multiple types per node for redundancy & maximized capture.
    *   Size: 1cm x 1cm x 0.5cm (scalable).
    *   Energy Storage: Solid-state micro-batteries or supercapacitors (1-10mWh capacity).
    *   Communication: Low-power Bluetooth mesh network. Each node transmits energy availability and load requests.
    *   Quantity: Scalable, deployment density dependent on application.
*   **Distribution Network:**
    *   Topology: Decentralized mesh network. No central controller.
    *   Routing: Adaptive routing algorithm.  Nodes prioritize paths with highest available power and lowest latency. Uses a modified A\* search algorithm.
    *   Power Conversion: DC-DC converters at each node to step up/down voltage to optimize energy transfer.  Converter efficiency >90%.
    *   Load Balancing: Dynamic voltage adjustment. Nodes increase output voltage to meet demand and decrease to conserve energy.
*   **Control Algorithm (executed on each node):**

```pseudocode
// Node State Variables
availablePower: float // Power currently available from harvester
loadRequest: float // Power requested by connected load
outputVoltage: float // Current output voltage
neighborNodes: list // List of nearby nodes
routingTable: dictionary // Mapping of destination node to next hop

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Measure Available Power
    availablePower = measureHarvesterOutput();

    // 2. Receive Load Requests from connected devices
    loadRequest = receiveLoadRequest();

    // 3. Determine excess or deficit power
    powerDifference = availablePower - loadRequest;

    // 4. If power deficit, request power from neighbors
    if (powerDifference < 0) {
        requestPowerFromNeighbors(abs(powerDifference));
    }

    // 5. If power surplus, offer power to neighbors
    if (powerDifference > 0) {
        offerPowerToNeighbors(powerDifference);
    }

    // 6. Adjust Output Voltage
    outputVoltage = regulateVoltage(loadRequest);

    // 7. Update Routing Table based on neighbor status
    updateRoutingTable();
}

// Helper Functions (simplified)
function regulateVoltage(requestedPower) {
    // Adjust voltage to meet requested power, within safe limits
    // Implement PID control for stable voltage regulation
    return calculateVoltage(requestedPower);
}

function requestPowerFromNeighbors(powerNeeded) {
    // Send broadcast message to neighbors
    // Request power with priority based on urgency
}

function offerPowerToNeighbors(powerAvailable) {
    // Send broadcast message to neighbors
    // Advertise available power
}

function updateRoutingTable() {
    // Exchange routing information with neighbors
    // Use a distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm to calculate shortest paths
}

```

*   **Applications:** Wearable electronics, IoT sensor networks, remote monitoring systems, portable medical devices, implantable sensors.
*   **Materials:** Flexible PCB, lightweight polymers, advanced energy harvesting materials.
