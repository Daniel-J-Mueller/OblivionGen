## Dynamic Reputation Scoring & Proactive Blocking

**Concept:** Extend the existing unauthorized code detection to proactively *block* potentially malicious sources *before* infection, based on a dynamic reputation scoring system that leverages collective learning across an organization and potentially, with anonymized data, across a wider network.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Scoring:**

*   **Traffic Analysis:** Monitor network traffic as described in the provided patent.  Log *all* accessed information sources (URLs, IP addresses, domain names) along with the accessing device ID.
*   **Behavioral Analysis:** Beyond simply identifying known malicious sources, analyze the *behavior* of each accessing device. Track metrics like:
    *   Frequency of access to newly observed information sources.
    *   Download size from new sources.
    *   Execution of downloaded content.
    *   Changes to system files after accessing a source.
*   **Reputation Score Calculation:**  Assign a dynamic reputation score to each information source.
    *   **Base Score:** Initially, all sources start with a neutral score.
    *   **Positive Signals:**  High frequency access by many unaffected devices increases the score.  Verification by security teams (manual or automated analysis) further increases the score.
    *   **Negative Signals:**  Detection of malicious activity on a device *after* accessing a source drastically decreases the score.  Reports from threat intelligence feeds contribute to the decrease. Behavioral anomalies also decrease the score.
    *   **Decay:** Reputation scores decay over time.  This accounts for legitimate sources that may be temporarily compromised.
*   **Scoring Formula (Example – adaptable):** `Reputation = Base + (PositiveWeight * PositiveSignal) - (NegativeWeight * NegativeSignal) - (DecayRate * TimeSinceLastAccess)`

**2. Proactive Blocking Mechanism:**

*   **Thresholds:** Define configurable reputation score thresholds:
    *   **Safe:**  High score – allow access without further scrutiny.
    *   **Warning:** Medium score – prompt the user with a warning message before allowing access.  (e.g., “This website is infrequently visited and may pose a risk. Proceed with caution?”)
    *   **Block:** Low score – prevent access entirely.  (Requires administrator override.)
*   **Real-time Blocking:** Implement a proxy server or network appliance that intercepts all outbound HTTP/HTTPS requests.
*   **Blocking Logic:** Before allowing a request to proceed, the proxy server checks the reputation score of the requested information source.  Based on the score, it either:
    *   Allows the request.
    *   Displays a warning message to the user.
    *   Blocks the request.

**3. Collective Learning & Anonymization:**

*   **Centralized Reputation Database:** Maintain a centralized database of reputation scores accessible by all network devices within the organization.
*   **Anonymized Data Sharing (Optional):**  Enable anonymized sharing of reputation data with a trusted network of partner organizations. This allows for faster detection of emerging threats.  (Data should be stripped of all personally identifiable information.)
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Allow security analysts to manually review and adjust reputation scores. This provides a mechanism for correcting errors and improving the accuracy of the system.

**4. Pseudocode for Blocking Logic (Proxy Server):**

```
function processRequest(request):
  url = request.url
  reputationScore = getReputationScore(url)

  if reputationScore >= SafeThreshold:
    allowRequest(request)
  else if reputationScore >= WarningThreshold:
    displayWarningToUser(request)
    if userAcceptsRisk:
      allowRequest(request)
    else:
      blockRequest(request)
  else:
    blockRequest(request)

function getReputationScore(url):
  // Retrieve score from centralized database
  // If not found, assign a default neutral score
  return score
```

**5.  System Components:**

*   **Network Monitor:**  Collects network traffic data.
*   **Reputation Engine:** Calculates and maintains reputation scores.
*   **Centralized Database:** Stores reputation scores.
*   **Proxy Server/Network Appliance:** Enforces blocking policies.
*   **Security Analyst Interface:** Provides tools for manual review and adjustment of reputation scores.
