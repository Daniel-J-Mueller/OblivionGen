**Dynamic Contextual "Time Capsules"**

**Concept:** Expand the contextual retrieval beyond simply *what* was viewed alongside a resource, to *when* and *how* it was viewed – reconstructing a localized “time capsule” of the user’s browsing experience.

**Specification:**

1.  **Data Capture:** Beyond storing accessed resources, log granular user interaction data during browsing sessions. This includes:
    *   Scroll depth for each resource
    *   Time spent on each element (buttons, images, text blocks)
    *   Mouse movement/heatmap data
    *   Zoom level
    *   Device orientation (mobile)
    *   Network conditions (latency, bandwidth)
2.  **"Time Capsule" Creation:**  When a search request is initiated, construct a “Time Capsule” for the potentially relevant browsing session. This capsule isn’t just a list of URLs, but a layered representation of the user's experience.  Data is aggregated to provide a holistic view of engagement.
3.  **Contextual Prioritization:**  The system doesn't just retrieve contextual resources (like the patent describes). It *ranks* those resources based on the “Time Capsule” data.  Resources with high engagement metrics (long time spent, deep scrolling, interaction) are prioritized.
4.  **"Replay" Mode:**  Allow users to see a simplified “replay” of their browsing session alongside the search results. This replay shows the contextual resources in the order they were viewed, with visual cues indicating engagement levels (e.g., brighter highlighting for high engagement).
5.  **"Snapshot" Comparison:**  Enable users to compare different “Time Capsules” from different browsing sessions. This allows them to see how their engagement with similar content has changed over time.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function retrieveContextualResources(searchRequest, userId) {
  // 1. Retrieve browsing history for userId
  browsingHistory = getBrowsingHistory(userId);

  // 2. Filter history for sessions containing search terms
  relevantSessions = filterSessionsBySearchTerms(browsingHistory, searchRequest);

  // 3. For each relevant session, construct a "Time Capsule"
  timeCapsules = [];
  for each session in relevantSessions {
    timeCapsule = createTimeCapsule(session);
    timeCapsules.add(timeCapsule);
  }

  // 4. Rank contextual resources within each Time Capsule based on engagement metrics
  rankedResources = rankContextualResources(timeCapsules);

  // 5. Return the top-ranked resources.
  return rankedResources;
}

function createTimeCapsule(session) {
  timeCapsule = {
    sessionId: session.sessionId,
    resources: [],
    engagementData: {}
  };

  for each resource in session.resources {
    timeCapsule.resources.add(resource);
    timeCapsule.engagementData[resource.url] = resource.engagementData;
  }

  return timeCapsule;
}

function rankContextualResources(timeCapsules) {
  // Aggregate engagement data across time capsules.
  aggregatedData = {};

  for each timeCapsule in timeCapsules {
    for each resource in timeCapsule.resources {
      if (!aggregatedData[resource.url]) {
        aggregatedData[resource.url] = 0;
      }
      aggregatedData[resource.url] += timeCapsule.engagementData[resource.url].totalEngagementScore;
    }
  }

  // Sort resources by engagement score.
  sortedResources = sortResourcesByEngagementScore(aggregatedData);

  return sortedResources;
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Integrate with eye-tracking data for even more precise engagement measurement.
*   Allow users to customize the engagement metrics used for ranking.
*   Develop a predictive model to anticipate what contextual resources a user might find helpful.
*   Apply differential privacy techniques to protect user data.
