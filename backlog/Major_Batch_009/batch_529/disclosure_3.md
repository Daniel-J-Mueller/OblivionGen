## Temporal Data Provenance & Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the time-based anomaly detection to not just *react* to potential inconsistencies, but to proactively build a probabilistic model of data provenance, enabling intelligent rollback and prediction of future conflicts.

**Specifications:**

**1. Provenance Tracking Layer:**

*   **Data Structures:**  Each data record will be augmented with a 'Provenance Vector'. This vector stores a history of modifications represented as tuples: `(Timestamp, NodeID, OperationType, CommitID)`.  `OperationType` will include: `INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, LOCK`.
*   **NodeID:**  Unique identifier for the computing node that performed the operation.
*   **CommitID:**  Unique identifier for the transaction that included the operation.
*   **Metadata Storage:**  Provenance Vectors are stored in a separate, append-only log associated with the data record.  This log is indexed by `Timestamp` for efficient querying.
*   **Log Compaction:**  Periodically compact provenance logs to reduce storage overhead.  Compaction merges adjacent entries and can apply aggregation (e.g., calculating the total time spent locked).

**2. Probabilistic Conflict Prediction:**

*   **Model Training:** A machine learning model (e.g., a Recurrent Neural Network) is trained on historical provenance data. The model learns patterns of data access and modification, identifying sequences of operations that frequently lead to conflicts.
*   **Input Features:** Model input includes: the Provenance Vector for the target record, the Provenance Vector for related records (identified through data dependencies), current system load, and node latencies.
*   **Output:**  The model predicts a 'Conflict Probability Score' representing the likelihood of a conflict occurring if a new operation is applied.
*   **Adaptive Threshold:** The Conflict Probability Score is compared to an adaptive threshold. This threshold is adjusted dynamically based on the system's risk tolerance and the cost of false positives vs. false negatives.

**3. Predictive Rollback Mechanism:**

*   **Conflict Detection:** Before applying a write request, the system calculates the Conflict Probability Score. If the score exceeds the adaptive threshold, the system initiates a "Predictive Rollback" procedure.
*   **Snapshot Creation:**  A read-only snapshot of the affected data is created *before* applying the write request.  This snapshot captures the data's state at the time of the conflict prediction.
*   **Write Application:** The write request is applied as normal.
*   **Validation & Rollback:** After the write is committed, a validation process compares the current data state to the snapshot. If inconsistencies are detected (e.g., a read request would have returned a different value before the write), the system automatically rolls back the write operation and restores the data to the snapshot state.
*   **Retry Mechanism:** Following a rollback, the system retries the original write request after a short delay.  The delay is adjusted dynamically based on the frequency of rollbacks.

**4. Pseudocode (Predictive Rollback Flow):**

```
function applyWriteRequest(writeRequest):
  conflictProbability = calculateConflictProbability(writeRequest)
  if conflictProbability > adaptiveThreshold:
    createSnapshot(affectedData)
    applyWriteRequest(writeRequest) // Apply write recursively
    if validateData(affectedData, snapshot):
      // Data is consistent
      return
    else:
      // Rollback
      rollbackToSnapshot(snapshot)
      retryWriteRequest(writeRequest) //Retry after delay
  else:
    applyWriteRequest(writeRequest) //Apply write if low probability
```

**5.  Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:**

*   **Metrics:** Monitor the frequency of rollbacks, the latency of write operations, and the number of concurrent requests.
*   **Algorithm:** Employ a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to dynamically adjust the adaptive threshold. The algorithm learns the optimal threshold value that minimizes the overall system cost (latency + rollback frequency).
*   **Feedback Loop:**  The reinforcement learning algorithm receives feedback from the system based on the outcomes of write operations and rollbacks.
