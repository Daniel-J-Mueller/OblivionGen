## Adaptive Resolution Performance Snapshotter

**Concept:** Expand the time-window counting concept into a multi-resolution, probabilistic performance snapshotter. Instead of *fixed* counting periods, the system dynamically adjusts the time window *and* the event selection based on observed event rates, creating a layered probabilistic view of system activity.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:**  “Resolution Manager” – a dedicated hardware block controlling time window counters and event multiplexers.
*   **Event Prioritization:** A configurable priority queue for event selection. High-priority events receive finer granularity (shorter time windows). Lower-priority events utilize coarser granularity.
*   **Probabilistic Layering:** Multiple time window counters operate in parallel, each with a different resolution.  Data from these counters is combined probabilistically. This creates a multi-resolution “snapshot” of activity.
*   **Adaptive Time Window:** The Resolution Manager monitors the event rate for each selected event. If the rate exceeds a threshold, the time window is *shortened*. If the rate falls below a threshold, the time window is *lengthened*.
*   **Event Selection Multiplexer:** Dynamically switches between different events to monitor based on system state or programmer-defined criteria.  This allows focusing on specific areas of interest.
*   **“Bloom Filter” Integration:** Employ a hardware Bloom filter to track event occurrences. This reduces memory footprint and allows for approximate counting.  False positives are acceptable, as the probabilistic layering provides redundancy.
*   **Data Fusion:**  A dedicated hardware block combines the data from the multiple time window counters and Bloom filters.  This generates a probabilistic “activity profile”.
*   **Output:** Activity profiles are streamed to a dedicated memory buffer for analysis. Data is time-stamped and tagged with resolution information.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Resolution Manager
loop:
  for each Event in EventQueue:
    CurrentRate = EventCounterRate(Event)
    if CurrentRate > HighThreshold:
      TimeWindow = MinTimeWindow
    elif CurrentRate < LowThreshold:
      TimeWindow = MaxTimeWindow
    else:
      TimeWindow = BaseTimeWindow
    StartCounter(Event, TimeWindow)

  //Bloom Filter Update
  for each Event in MonitoredEvents:
    UpdateBloomFilter(EventCounterValue(Event))

  //Data Fusion
  ActivityProfile = CombineCounterData(CounterValues) + BloomFilterData()

  SendActivityProfile(ActivityProfile, Timestamp)
end loop
```
