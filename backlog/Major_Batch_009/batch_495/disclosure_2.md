## Dynamic Policy Inheritance & 'Shadow' Environments

**Concept:** Expand the notion of policy tags beyond simple enforcement to enable *dynamic* policy inheritance and the creation of temporary, isolated “shadow” environments for data testing and validation before full deployment.

**Specs:**

**1. Policy ‘Recipes’:**

*   Introduce “Policy Recipes” - structured data blocks defining a set of policies and their application criteria (tags, data types, user roles, etc.). These are versioned.
*   Recipes aren’t policies themselves, but *instructions* on how to assemble policies.
*   Recipes can be chained – a base recipe can be extended with add-on recipes for specific scenarios.

**2. Shadow Environment Provisioning:**

*   Upon receiving a data object with associated policy identifiers, a system component can request a “Shadow Environment” instance.
*   Shadow Environments are temporary, isolated containers (e.g., lightweight VMs, serverless functions) provisioned on-demand.
*   The system assembles the relevant policies from the identified recipes and applies them *within* the Shadow Environment.

**3. Data ‘Replay’ & Validation:**

*   A copy of the data object is sent to the Shadow Environment.
*   The system automatically executes a pre-defined set of validation tests against the data within the Shadow Environment, checking for policy compliance (access control, data masking, encryption, etc.).
*   Validation results are reported back to the originating system.

**4. Policy ‘Drift’ Detection:**

*   The system monitors changes to Policy Recipes.
*   If a Recipe used by a deployed data object is modified, a notification is triggered.
*   Optionally, the system can automatically re-validate affected data objects in production (or a staging environment) against the updated policies.

**5. Tag-Based Policy Assembly:**

*   Policy Recipes utilize tags embedded in data objects to dynamically assemble the appropriate policy set.
*   Tags aren’t just identifiers; they can also carry parameters influencing policy behavior (e.g., “sensitivity=high”, “retention=90days”).

**Pseudocode (Shadow Environment Provisioning):**

```
function provisionShadowEnvironment(dataObject, policyIdentifier) {

  recipe = getPolicyRecipe(policyIdentifier);
  if (recipe == null) {
    throw "Policy Recipe not found";
  }

  environment = createIsolatedEnvironment(); // Container or function

  // Apply policies to the environment based on the recipe and data tags
  applyPolicies(environment, recipe, dataObject.tags);

  return environment;
}

function applyPolicies(environment, recipe, dataTags) {
  for (policy in recipe.policies) {
    if (dataTags.includes(policy.tag)) {
      installPolicy(environment, policy.implementation);
    }
  }
}
```

**Innovation Focus:** This pushes beyond simple policy enforcement to enable proactive validation and adaptation of policies.  The “Shadow Environment” concept allows for safe testing of data and policies before full deployment, mitigating risks and ensuring compliance. The recipe-based system allows for a flexible and auditable approach to policy management. It allows for complex policies to be built from modular blocks, which is key to maintainability and scalability.
