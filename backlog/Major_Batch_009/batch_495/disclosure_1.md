## Dynamic Dimensionality Adjustment

**Concept:** The existing patent centers around a hybrid storage approach leveraging both multidimensional region hierarchies and column-centric data. This proposal builds on that by introducing *dynamic dimensionality adjustment* within the hierarchy. The system will analyze data distribution and automatically adjust the number of dimensions used to represent regions at different levels of the hierarchy. This addresses the 'curse of dimensionality' and optimizes storage and search efficiency.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Distribution Analyzer:**
    *   Module to analyze incoming data for each dimension.
    *   Calculates entropy or variance for each dimension.
    *   Establishes a threshold for acceptable dimensionality. Dimensions below the threshold are candidates for reduction.
*   **Dimensionality Reduction/Expansion Engine:**
    *   Algorithm to combine or split dimensions based on data distribution analysis.
    *   **Dimension Combination:** If two dimensions exhibit strong correlation (above a configurable threshold), combine them into a single, derived dimension using a mathematical transformation (e.g., linear combination, principal component analysis).  The transformation parameters are stored alongside the region data.
    *   **Dimension Splitting:**  If a dimension has a highly uneven distribution, split it into multiple sub-dimensions with narrower ranges.
*   **Hierarchy Adaptation Logic:**
    *   Regions at lower levels of the hierarchy (leaf nodes) maintain the highest dimensionality for granular data access.
    *   As you move up the hierarchy, dimensions are dynamically combined or split based on the analysis, reducing the overall dimensionality at higher levels for faster range queries.
*   **Metadata Extension:**
    *   Each region record (interior and leaf) must store metadata indicating:
        *   Active dimensions: A bitmask identifying which dimensions are currently used for this region.
        *   Transformation parameters: If dimensions were combined, store the linear transformation matrix or other relevant parameters.
        *   Dimension split information: If a dimension was split, store the boundaries of the sub-dimensions.
*   **Query Processor Adaptation:**
    *   The query processor must be modified to:
        *   Understand the active dimensions for each region.
        *   Apply the appropriate transformation to the query parameters if necessary.
        *   Iterate over the relevant sub-dimensions for split dimensions.
*   **Storage Format:**
    *   Columnar data will be adapted to store a variable number of dimensions.  The metadata for each region indicates how many dimensions are active.  Inactive dimensions are ignored during queries.
*   **Pseudocode (Query Processing):**

```
function processQuery(query, region):
  activeDimensions = getActiveDimensions(region)
  transformedQuery = transformQuery(query, region) // Apply transformation if any
  
  filteredData = []
  
  for dataPoint in region.data:
    
    match = true
    for dimension in activeDimensions:
      if not (dataPoint[dimension] >= transformedQuery[dimension][0] AND dataPoint[dimension] <= transformedQuery[dimension][1]):
        match = false
        break
    
    if match:
      filteredData.append(dataPoint)
  
  return filteredData
```

**Rationale:**

The core idea is to tailor the dimensionality to the specific data distribution at each level of the hierarchy. This can significantly improve query performance by reducing the search space and minimizing irrelevant dimensions. It also allows the system to adapt to changing data patterns over time, maintaining optimal efficiency. By intelligently reducing dimensionality, the system sidesteps the inefficiencies introduced by high-dimensional data, while still providing the granularity needed for accurate searches.
