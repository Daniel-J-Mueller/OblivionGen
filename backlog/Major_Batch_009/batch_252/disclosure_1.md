## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Mapping for Spatial Awareness

**Concept:** Expand the proximity sensing beyond simple presence detection to create a rudimentary spatial map of objects surrounding the device. Utilize the capacitance changes detected by the existing system, not just as a trigger for power reduction, but as data points for building a localized "resonance map". 

**Specs:**

*   **Capacitance Array:** Integrate multiple, physically distinct, capacitively sensitive pads on the device housing (beyond those already used for the antenna system). These pads should be arranged in a non-linear fashion – consider a spiral or hexagonal pattern for broader coverage. Each pad connects to a dedicated analog-to-digital converter (ADC).
*   **Resonance Frequency Sweep:** Instead of a single, fixed frequency for the capacitance sensor, implement a dynamic sweep across a range of low frequencies (e.g., 100 Hz – 1 MHz). The optimal frequency will vary based on the dielectric properties and size of the nearby object.
*   **Object Profiling:** Algorithm to analyze the capacitance *and* resonance frequency response of each pad. This data allows the system to differentiate between different materials (metal, organic, liquid) and approximate object size.
*   **Spatial Mapping Engine:** A localized map is constructed, representing the presence and approximate shape of objects near the device. The map doesn’t need to be high-resolution or visually rendered – it’s a data structure (e.g., occupancy grid) representing the probability of an object being present at a given location.
*   **Predictive Power Control:** Based on the spatial map, the system anticipates potential interference or signal blockage.  It dynamically adjusts transmission power and antenna beamforming to minimize interference and maintain connection quality.  For example, if the map indicates a large metal object is blocking the signal path, the system can increase power or switch to a different antenna.
*    **Haptic Feedback Integration:** Use the spatial map data to generate localized haptic feedback. For example, if a hand is detected near the device, a vibration pattern can be activated to simulate a button press or provide a confirmation signal.

**Pseudocode (Core Mapping Engine):**

```
// Data Structures
OccupancyGrid grid[X][Y]; // Represents the spatial map
SensorData sensorArray[N]; // Data from each capacitance pad

// Function: Update Spatial Map
function updateMap() {
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        sensorArray[i] = readSensorData(i); // Get capacitance & resonance frequency
        objectType = identifyObjectType(sensorArray[i]); // Determine material and size
        location = calculateLocation(i); // Map sensor to spatial coordinates
        grid[location.x][location.y].probability = sensorArray[i].signalStrength;
        grid[location.x][location.y].objectType = objectType;
    }
}

// Function: Identify Object Type
function identifyObjectType(sensorData) {
    if (sensorData.resonanceFrequency > thresholdHigh) {
        return "Metal";
    } else if (sensorData.resonanceFrequency < thresholdLow) {
        return "Organic";
    } else {
        return "Unknown";
    }
}
```

**Materials:** Existing device housing materials, additional low-power ADCs, minor PCB redesign.
