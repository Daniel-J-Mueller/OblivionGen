## Dynamic Preference Propagation via Decentralized Social Graphs

**Concept:** Expand the recommendation engine beyond direct user-social network connections to leverage a *decentralized* network of preference propagation. This addresses the limitations of centralized social graphs (privacy, single points of failure, susceptibility to manipulation) while enhancing discovery beyond immediate circles.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Source:** Integrate with federated social protocols (ActivityPub, Nostr) alongside traditional centralized platforms (with user consent, of course). This creates a heterogeneous, distributed social graph.
*   **Preference Encoding:** Represent user preferences not as explicit ratings, but as *interaction vectors*. This captures nuanced engagement (time spent viewing, scrolling speed, share patterns, etc.). These vectors will be continually updated.
*   **Propagation Algorithm:** Implement a weighted random walk algorithm on the distributed social graph.  Weights are determined by:
    *   **Explicit connections:**  Friendships, follows, etc.
    *   **Implicit affinity:**  Calculated based on the cosine similarity of interaction vectors between users. This allows for “weak ties” to contribute.
    *   **Content affinity:**  Similarity between items interacted with.
*   **Decentralized Trust Scoring:** Assign a "trust score" to each propagation hop based on the reputation of the user transmitting the preference.  Reputation is calculated from interactions *within* the federated network, making it resistant to centralized manipulation.
*   **Recommendation Generation:**  For a target user, run multiple random walks originating from their connections. Aggregate the weighted recommendations from each walk.  Higher weight is given to walks originating from high-trust nodes and those with strong content affinity.
*   **"Serendipity Factor":** Introduce a probabilistic element to the propagation, allowing for exploration of distant nodes.  The probability is inversely proportional to the distance (number of hops) and directly proportional to the serendipity preference of the user.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Generation):**

```
function generateRecommendation(targetUser, numWalks):
  recommendations = {}
  for i in range(numWalks):
    startNode = getRandomConnection(targetUser)
    walk = []
    currentNode = startNode
    for j in range(maxWalkLength):
      walk.append(currentNode)
      nextNodes = getConnections(currentNode)
      nextNode = weightedRandomChoice(nextNodes, getTrustScores(currentNode))
      if nextNode == currentNode: // prevent loops
        break
      currentNode = nextNode
    
    for item in getItemsInteractedWith(walk): // Get items the walk interacted with
      if item not in recommendations:
        recommendations[item] = 0
      recommendations[item] += calculateWalkWeight(walk) // Walk Weight considers trust and path length
      
  return sortRecommendations(recommendations)
```

**Hardware Considerations:** Requires substantial distributed computing resources to maintain and query the federated social graph. Edge computing may be used to cache portions of the graph for faster response times.

**Potential Applications:** 
*   Hyper-personalized recommendations beyond the limitations of existing centralized systems.
*   Discovery of niche products and content that would otherwise be missed.
*   Increased user privacy and control over their data. 
*   Creation of a more resilient and democratic recommendation ecosystem.
