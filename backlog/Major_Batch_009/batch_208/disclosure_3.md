## Distributed File System – Predictive Pre-Rename

**Concept:** Introduce a predictive pre-rename mechanism leveraging machine learning to anticipate renames *before* they are requested, optimizing metadata operations and reducing latency. This builds on the existing atomic operation concepts, but moves towards proactive management.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Rename Service (PRS). Runs as a separate microservice, integrated with the existing metadata subsystem.
*   **Data Source:**  PRS monitors file system access patterns: read/write frequency, access times, user/application initiating access, and the directory structure traversed.  Logs of prior rename operations are also ingested.
*   **Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on historical access and rename data. The LSTM predicts the probability of a file being renamed *within a defined time window* (e.g., next hour, next day).
*   **Pre-Rename Procedure:**
    1.  PRS identifies files with a high rename probability (threshold configurable).
    2.  PRS initiates a *shadow* metadata entry for the anticipated new name *without* user intervention.  This includes reserving the name in the directory listing (but marking it as ‘reserved-shadow’).
    3.  PRS pre-locks the existing directory entry *at low priority* – enough to prevent immediate conflicting renames, but not interfering with normal operations.
    4.  When a user *actually* initiates a rename to the predicted new name:
        *   PRS detects the match.
        *   The shadow entry is promoted to a live entry.
        *   The existing directory entry is deleted.
        *   The low-priority lock is released.
        *   All operations occur within the existing atomic operation framework, guaranteeing consistency.
    5.  If the predicted rename *doesn’t* happen within the time window:
        *   The shadow entry is deleted.
        *   The low-priority lock is released.
*   **Failure Handling:**
    *   If a conflicting rename request arrives *before* the PRS-initiated rename, the PRS rename is cancelled, and standard atomic operations proceed.
    *   PRS monitors its own success rate. If the prediction accuracy falls below a threshold, it dynamically adjusts the prediction window or retrains the model.
*   **API:**
    *   `PRS.PredictRename(file_path)`: Returns a probability score for a rename within the prediction window.
    *   `PRS.Monitor(file_path)`:  Starts monitoring a file for potential rename events.
*   **Pseudocode (PRS.Monitor):**

```
function Monitor(file_path):
  // Check if file_path is already being monitored
  if IsMonitored(file_path):
    return

  // Get prediction score
  prediction_score = PredictRename(file_path)

  //If prediction_score > threshold:
  //  Create shadow metadata entry for predicted new name
  //  Acquire low-priority lock on existing directory entry
  //  Start a timer for the prediction window
  //  On timer expiry:
  //    Release low-priority lock
  //    Delete shadow metadata entry
  //  Listen for actual rename request for file_path:
  //    If rename request matches predicted name:
  //      Promote shadow metadata entry to live entry
  //      Delete existing directory entry
  //      Release lock
  //    else:
  //      Delete shadow metadata entry
  //      Release lock
```

This system aims to anticipate and partially pre-execute rename operations, reducing latency and improving the user experience. The low-priority locks minimize interference with normal file system operations, and the machine learning model adapts to changing access patterns.
