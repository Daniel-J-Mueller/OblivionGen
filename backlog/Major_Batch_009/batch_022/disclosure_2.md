**Dynamic Cluster Sharding Based on Real-Time User Behavior**

**Specification:**

**1. Overview:**

This system extends the concept of clustering users for CDN routing by introducing *dynamic sharding* within those clusters. Instead of static cluster assignments, users are momentarily assigned to sub-clusters (shards) based on their immediate browsing behavior—specifically, the *type* of content they are actively requesting. This allows for granular, real-time optimization of resource delivery.

**2. Components:**

*   **Behavioral Analyzer:** A module integrated with the DNS server. It analyzes incoming DNS queries not just for the resource requested, but also classifies the *type* of resource (e.g., video stream, static image, Javascript file, API call).  This classification uses a continuously updated machine learning model.
*   **Shard Manager:** Responsible for dynamically assigning users to shards.  Shards represent different configurations optimized for specific content types.  A user may be assigned to different shards over a short period as their browsing activity changes.
*   **Shard Profiles:** Configuration profiles for each shard, defining:
    *   Cache Component Selection Strategy: The algorithm for choosing which CDN cache server to use.
    *   DNS Server Prioritization: The order in which DNS servers are queried.
    *   Traffic Shaping Rules:  QoS settings applied to traffic from users in that shard.
*   **Performance Monitor:** Continuously tracks the performance of each shard (latency, throughput, error rate) and feeds this data back to the Shard Manager.
*   **Adaptive Weighting Engine:** This component dynamically adjusts the probability weighting of each shard based on observed performance and user load.

**3. Workflow:**

1.  A DNS query arrives at the CDN's DNS server.
2.  The Behavioral Analyzer classifies the requested resource type.
3.  The Shard Manager determines the optimal shard for the user based on the resource type *and* the user’s recent browsing history (a short-term memory of resource types requested).
4.  The user is temporarily assigned to the selected shard.
5.  The CDN routes the request according to the shard’s configuration (cache selection, DNS server prioritization, traffic shaping).
6.  The Performance Monitor tracks the delivery performance.
7.  The Adaptive Weighting Engine adjusts the shard probabilities based on performance data.

**4. Pseudocode (Shard Manager):**

```
function selectShard(userID, resourceType, recentHistory):
  // recentHistory: List of resource types requested by user in last X seconds
  shardCandidates = getShardCandidates(resourceType)

  //Score each candidate shard based on:
  //-Shard's average performance for this resource type
  //-User's historical preference for shards handling this resource
  for each shard in shardCandidates:
    score = calculateShardScore(shard, resourceType, userID)
    shardScores[shard] = score

  //Select the highest scoring shard
  bestShard = maxShard(shardScores)

  return bestShard
```

**5. Novelty & Benefits:**

*   **Granular Optimization:**  Moves beyond broad cluster-based routing to extremely granular, real-time adaptation.
*   **Improved User Experience:** Reduces latency and improves throughput by delivering content optimized for the user’s *current* activity.
*   **Adaptive Load Balancing:** Dynamically distributes load across CDN resources based on content type and user behavior.
*   **Resilience:** If a shard experiences issues, users are seamlessly shifted to other healthy shards.
