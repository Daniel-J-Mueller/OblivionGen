## Dynamic Audio ‘Sculpting’ Based on Emotional Resonance

**Concept:** Expand on the selective audio data removal concept by shifting from purely temporal/interval-based removal to *emotionally-informed* sculpting of audio. The system aims to retain audio segments most strongly correlated with perceived emotional content, discarding those deemed less impactful, creating a highly condensed yet emotionally resonant audio stream.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Emotional Analysis Engine:**
    *   Input: Raw audio stream (PCM, WAV, etc.).
    *   Process: Employ a multi-modal emotional analysis pipeline. This combines:
        *   **Acoustic Feature Extraction:**  Analyze prosodic features (pitch, intensity, rhythm, pauses) indicative of emotion.
        *   **Semantic Analysis (ASR & NLU):** Utilize ASR to transcribe speech. Employ NLU to extract semantic meaning & identify emotional keywords/phrases.
        *   **Contextual Awareness:** Incorporate metadata (e.g., location, time of day, user activity) to refine emotional interpretation.
    *   Output:  Emotional "heat map" – a time-series representation assigning an emotional intensity score (ranging from -1 to +1 – negative to positive) to each short audio segment (e.g., 50ms-100ms).

*   **Component 2: Sculpting Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Raw audio stream, Emotional Heat Map.
    *   Process:
        1.  **Segmentation:** Divide the raw audio into segments aligned with the Emotional Heat Map.
        2.  **Thresholding:**  Establish a dynamic threshold based on a user-defined 'emotional retention' parameter (0-100%). Segments falling below the threshold are candidates for removal.  The threshold is *not* static; it dynamically adjusts based on the overall emotional intensity of the audio.  Higher average intensity -> stricter threshold.
        3.  **Redundancy Analysis:**  Within segments *not* removed by thresholding, identify and remove highly similar audio frames.  This uses a perceptual audio hashing algorithm (e.g., based on spectral centroid, bandwidth, flatness) to detect redundancy.
        4.  **Smoothing:**  Apply a smoothing filter to the resulting audio to minimize any abrupt transitions caused by the removal process.
    *   Output: Sculpted Audio Stream.

*   **Component 3: Decompression Engine:**
    *   Input: Sculpted Audio Stream, Metadata (threshold used, redundancy hash table)
    *   Process:
        1.  Reconstruct the audio by inserting placeholder silence or synthesized audio where segments were removed.  The choice of reconstruction method depends on the metadata.
        2.  If redundancy hashing was used, access the hash table to recreate the removed frames.
        3.  Smooth the reconstructed audio.
    *   Output: Reconstructed Audio Stream.

**Pseudocode (Sculpting Algorithm):**

```
function sculptAudio(audio, emotionalHeatMap, retentionPercentage):
  segments = splitAudioIntoSegments(audio, segmentDuration)
  threshold = calculateThreshold(emotionalHeatMap, retentionPercentage)

  sculptedSegments = []
  for segment in segments:
    emotionalIntensity = getEmotionalIntensity(emotionalHeatMap, segmentIndex)
    if emotionalIntensity < threshold:
      //Remove Segment
      continue
    else:
      //Perform redundancy removal
      segment = removeRedundantFrames(segment)
      sculptedSegments.append(segment)

  return concatenateSegments(sculptedSegments)
```

**Novelty:** Existing compression focuses on data size. This focuses on *emotional preservation*, allowing for potentially extreme compression ratios without losing perceived emotional impact. This could be used in applications like:

*   **Emotion-focused audio summaries:** Creating highly condensed summaries that retain the emotional essence of longer content.
*   **Low-bandwidth communication:** Delivering audio with minimal bandwidth while preserving emotional context.
*   **Adaptive audio for accessibility:**  Condensing audio to emphasize key emotional cues for individuals with hearing impairments.
