## Dynamic Contextual Item Introduction via Augmented Reality

**Concept:** Leverage the existing user tracking and pathing system to dynamically introduce relevant items *directly into the user’s field of view* via augmented reality (AR) headsets or smart glasses. Instead of simply modifying the path, proactively *present* items, increasing impulse buys and enhancing the overall experience.

**System Specs:**

*   **AR Headset Integration:** System compatible with commercially available AR headsets (e.g., Microsoft HoloLens, Magic Leap, future iterations of smart glasses).
*   **Real-time 3D Rendering Engine:**  A robust rendering engine capable of overlaying high-quality 3D models of items onto the user’s live view.  Model fidelity scaled based on headset capabilities.
*   **Spatial Mapping & Anchoring:** Precise spatial mapping of the materials handling facility to accurately anchor AR item projections. Ongoing recalibration to maintain accuracy during user movement.
*   **Contextual Data Pipeline:** Integrates with existing user data (pick lists, purchase history, wish lists) *and* real-time environmental data (location, nearby items, time of day, promotional campaigns).
*   **AI-Powered Item Selection:** Algorithm to determine *which* items to present based on contextual data. Prioritization of:
    *   Items directly related to the pick list (e.g., accessories, consumables).
    *   Recommended items based on purchase history and preferences.
    *   Promotional items relevant to the user's location or current activity.
    *   ‘Discovery’ items – entirely new or unexpected recommendations.
*   **Dynamic Projection Parameters:** Control over:
    *   Item size and scale within the user’s view.
    *   Animation and highlighting effects.
    *   Audio cues (e.g., subtle sounds associated with the item).
    *   Placement within the environment (e.g., appearing *on* shelves, *beside* the user).
*   **Gesture & Voice Control:** Users can interact with AR items using hand gestures or voice commands:
    *   “Add to cart”
    *   “Show details”
    *   “Dismiss”
*   **Data Analytics & Feedback:** Track user interactions with AR items (views, clicks, purchases) to refine the item selection algorithm and optimize the AR experience.

**Pseudocode (Item Presentation Logic):**

```
FUNCTION PresentARItems(userLocation, userPickList, userPreferences)

    // Get nearby items within a defined radius
    nearbyItems = GetNearbyItems(userLocation)

    // Filter items based on pick list and preferences
    relevantItems = FilterItems(nearbyItems, userPickList, userPreferences)

    // Prioritize items using AI algorithm
    prioritizedItems = AI.PrioritizeItems(relevantItems, userHistory, context)

    // Select top N items to present (N configurable)
    selectedItems = prioritizedItems.TopN(3)

    // For each selected item
    FOR EACH item IN selectedItems
        // Calculate optimal AR projection parameters
        projectionParams = CalculateProjectionParams(item, userLocation)

        // Render AR item in user’s view
        RenderARItem(item, projectionParams)
    END FOR

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateProjectionParams(item, userLocation)
    // Determine optimal size, position, and orientation based on:
    // - Distance to user
    // - Shelf location
    // - Obstructions
    // - User’s gaze direction

    // Calculate size based on distance (larger objects appear further away)
    size = CalculateSize(distance)

    // Position the item to appear on the shelf or near the user
    position = CalculatePosition(shelfLocation, userLocation)

    // Orient the item for optimal viewing angle
    orientation = CalculateOrientation(userGaze)

    RETURN size, position, orientation
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**

This isn’t simply path optimization. It's proactive item *presentation*. It anticipates needs and introduces items directly into the user’s perceptual field, creating a more immersive and engaging experience.  It shifts the focus from reactive route changes to proactive, personalized recommendations.
