## Dynamic Key Sharding & Temporal Access Control

**Concept:** Extend the existing encrypted volume key management to incorporate key *sharding* and *temporal access control* policies, enabling granular control over data access based on both *who* is accessing the data *and* *when*. This isn't just about permissions, it’s about data availability windows.

**Specs:**

**1. Key Sharding Module:**

*   **Function:** Divide the encrypted volume key into multiple "key shares".
*   **Algorithm:** Utilize a Secret Sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir’s Secret Sharing) to generate `n` key shares from the volume key.  A threshold `k` determines the minimum number of shares required to reconstruct the original key.
*   **Storage:** Distribute key shares across physically separate, trusted hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure enclaves. *Not* a single centralized location.
*   **Reconstruction Trigger:**  Initiated by the host computer system *only* when access to the volume is required.  A distributed key agreement protocol (e.g., using a consensus algorithm like Raft) is used to coordinate reconstruction.

**2. Temporal Access Control Policy Engine:**

*   **Policy Definition:** Policies are defined using a JSON-based language with the following structure:

    ```json
    {
      "volume_id": "unique_volume_identifier",
      "client_id": "client_identifying_string",
      "start_time": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
      "end_time": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
      "access_level": "read/write/execute",
      "required_shares": "integer between 1 and n"
    }
    ```
*   **Policy Storage:** Policies are stored in a distributed, tamper-proof database.
*   **Evaluation:**  When an access request is made, the policy engine evaluates the request against the defined policies.  It checks:
    *   Client ID matches the policy.
    *   Current time falls within the specified `start_time` and `end_time`.
    *   The requesting host can provide the `required_shares` for key reconstruction.

**3. Host System Integration:**

*   **API Calls:** New API calls are added to the host system:
    *   `RequestVolumeAccess(volume_id, client_id)` – Initiates the access request, triggering policy evaluation.
    *   `ProvideKeyShare(key_share_id)` – Allows the host to contribute a key share during reconstruction.
    *   `ReleaseVolumeAccess(volume_id)` - Signals the end of access and triggers key reconstruction teardown.
*   **Key Reconstruction Coordinator:** The host system acts as a coordinator for key reconstruction. It:
    *   Collects `required_shares` from the HSMs.
    *   Initiates key reconstruction using the Secret Sharing algorithm.
    *   Obtains the plaintext volume key.
    *   Provides access to the volume based on the reconstructed key.

**4. Auditing & Logging:**

*   **Detailed Logging:** All access requests, policy evaluations, key reconstruction events, and key share contributions are logged with timestamps and client/host identifiers.
*   **Tamper-Proof Audit Trail:**  Audit logs are stored in a write-once, append-only format, potentially leveraging blockchain technology.



**Pseudocode (Host System - `RequestVolumeAccess`):**

```
function RequestVolumeAccess(volume_id, client_id):
  // 1. Retrieve access policy from distributed database
  policy = GetAccessPolicy(volume_id, client_id)

  // 2. Check if access is permitted based on policy (time, client ID)
  if (policy == null || !IsAccessPermitted(policy, currentTime)):
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  // 3. Initiate key share requests from HSMs
  required_shares = policy.required_shares
  key_shares = []
  for i = 0 to required_shares:
    // Network call to HSM to request key share
    share = GetKeyShare(HSM_ID_i) //HSM IDs are preconfigured
    key_shares.append(share)

  // 4. Reconstruct the volume key
  plaintext_volume_key = ReconstructKey(key_shares)

  // 5. Provide access to the volume using the plaintext key
  GrantVolumeAccess(plaintext_volume_key)

  return ACCESS_GRANTED
```

This system enhances security by reducing the blast radius of a compromised HSM, enforcing time-based access restrictions, and creating a detailed audit trail. It builds on the existing encrypted volume key concept by adding layers of control and resilience.
