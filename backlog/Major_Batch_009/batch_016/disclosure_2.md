## Adaptive Memory Partitioning for Live Update

**Concept:** Dynamically allocate and partition memory regions based on observed access patterns *during* the paused state, optimizing checkpoint size and live update speed. The existing patent focuses on checkpointing known state. This expands on that by *learning* what is truly necessary to preserve, rather than relying on a static descriptor.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Profiling Phase (during pause):**
    *   Initiate a memory access profiler upon pausing the instance.
    *   The profiler tracks all read and write operations within the memory space of the paused instance.
    *   Access frequency, data types accessed, and code sections triggering accesses are logged.
    *   A “heat map” of memory access is created. Higher frequency = higher ‘heat’.

2.  **Partitioning Algorithm:**
    *   The memory space is divided into partitions based on the heat map.
    *   **Critical Partition:** Highest heat – Contains essential state for immediate restoration. Smallest size.
    *   **Warm Partition:** Medium heat – Contains frequently used, but potentially reconstructable state. Medium size.
    *   **Cold Partition:** Lowest heat – Contains rarely used or easily reconstructible state. Largest size.
    *   Partitions are defined by memory address ranges.

3.  **Checkpointing Strategy:**
    *   **Critical Partition:** Fully checkpointed to a persistent storage.
    *   **Warm Partition:** Checkpointed using a lossy compression algorithm (e.g., Delta encoding). Lossy is acceptable due to frequent reconstructability.
    *   **Cold Partition:** Not checkpointed. Reconstructed on resume via lazy loading from disk or re-computation.

4.  **Resume Phase:**
    *   Load Critical Partition from persistent storage into memory.
    *   Load Warm Partition (compressed) and decompress it into memory.
    *   Allocate memory for Cold Partition on demand, reconstructing data as needed.
    *   Resume execution.

5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   The profiling and partitioning process should be re-run periodically during operation.
    *   This adapts to changing application behavior and optimizes checkpoint/resume performance.
    *   If a Cold Partition segment is consistently accessed, it is promoted to Warm or Critical.

**Pseudocode (Partitioning Algorithm):**

```
function partitionMemory(memoryMap, threshold_warm, threshold_critical):
  critical_partition = []
  warm_partition = []
  cold_partition = []

  for address, access_count in memoryMap.items():
    if access_count > threshold_critical:
      critical_partition.append(address)
    elif access_count > threshold_warm:
      warm_partition.append(address)
    else:
      cold_partition.append(address)

  return critical_partition, warm_partition, cold_partition
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires a memory controller capable of dynamic memory region allocation.
*   Benefits from fast persistent storage (e.g., NVMe SSD) to minimize resume time.
*   Hardware-accelerated compression/decompression can improve performance.
