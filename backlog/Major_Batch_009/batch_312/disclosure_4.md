## Decentralized Policy Enforcement with Attestation Tokens

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of delegated authentication to enable granular, decentralized policy enforcement *after* initial authentication, leveraging blockchain-based attestation tokens. This moves beyond simple allow/deny decisions to facilitate dynamic access control based on real-time conditions and verifiable credentials.

**Specification:**

**1. Attestation Token Generation:**

*   Upon successful authentication (as described in the base patent), the authentication system generates an Attestation Token.
*   The token isn't merely a confirmation of identity; it *encodes* a set of dynamically generated policies relevant to the authenticated client. These policies are defined by the service provider (or potentially even the client, subject to provider approval).
*   Token format: JSON Web Token (JWT) signed by the authentication system. Payload includes:
    *   `subject`: Client identifier.
    *   `iss`: Authentication system identifier.
    *   `aud`: Audience – identifies the services the token is valid for.
    *   `policies`: An array of JSON objects defining the allowed actions, resource access, and conditions. Example:
        ```json
        [
            {
                "resource": "database_x",
                "action": "read",
                "condition": "time_of_day < 18:00"
            },
            {
                "resource": "api_y",
                "action": "write",
                "condition": "user_role == 'admin'"
            }
        ]
    *   `expiration`: Token validity timeframe.

**2. Blockchain Integration:**

*   A permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) is used to anchor the Attestation Token's metadata. *Not the entire token is stored on the blockchain;* only a cryptographic hash of the token's content, along with a timestamp and issuer identifier.
*   This creates an immutable audit trail, proving the token's existence and its state at a specific point in time.  Blockchain transactions are minimal to reduce overhead.

**3. Policy Enforcement at Second/Third Systems:**

*   The second (and potentially subsequent) systems do *not* directly communicate with the authentication system for every access request. They receive the Attestation Token from the first system.
*   **Validation Steps:**
    1.  **Signature Verification:** Verify the token’s signature using the authentication system’s public key.
    2.  **Blockchain Verification:**  Query the blockchain to confirm the existence of the token's hash at the claimed timestamp.
    3.  **Policy Evaluation:** Evaluate the token’s `policies` array against the incoming request (resource, action, user context).  A dedicated Policy Engine module handles this.
*   Access is granted *only* if all validation steps pass and the request aligns with the token's policies.

**4. Dynamic Policy Updates:**

*   Policies can be updated by the authentication system.
*   A new Attestation Token is generated with the updated policies.
*   The old token is marked as revoked (by adding its hash to a revocation list on the blockchain).
*   Second/third systems periodically check the revocation list.

**Pseudocode (Policy Engine - Second System):**

```
function enforcePolicy(request, token) {
  if (!verifyTokenSignature(token)) {
    return ACCESS_DENIED;
  }

  blockchainHash = getBlockchainHash(token);
  if (!verifyBlockchainHash(blockchainHash)) {
    return ACCESS_DENIED;
  }

  for (policy in token.policies) {
    if (request.resource == policy.resource &&
        request.action == policy.action) {
      if (evaluateCondition(policy.condition, request.context)) {
        return ACCESS_GRANTED;
      } else {
        return ACCESS_DENIED;
      }
    }
  }

  return ACCESS_DENIED; // No matching policy
}
```

**Scalability & Benefits:**

*   Reduced load on the authentication system.
*   Fine-grained access control.
*   Enhanced auditability.
*   Support for complex, dynamic policies.
*   Increased resilience (decentralization).
