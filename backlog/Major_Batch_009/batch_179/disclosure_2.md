## Adaptive Request Obfuscation with Dynamic Payload Splitting

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of protecting data in transit by not just replacing encrypted data with plaintext, but by *dynamically splitting* the original request payload into multiple, seemingly unrelated sub-requests, each handled by different intermediary services before reassembly. This dramatically increases the complexity of interception and reconstruction of the original data.

**Specifications:**

**1. Payload Decomposition Module:**

   *   **Input:** Original Request (containing sensitive data).
   *   **Process:**
        *   Analyze the request payload to identify data fields.
        *   Employ a configurable splitting algorithm (e.g., based on field size, data type, entropy).
        *   Divide the payload into *N* sub-payloads. Each sub-payload contains a portion of the original data *and* metadata indicating its position within the original payload and the total number of sub-payloads (*N*).
        *   Each sub-payload is then encapsulated within a distinct, independent request.
   *   **Output:** *N* independent requests, each containing a sub-payload and metadata.

**2. Dynamic Routing Engine:**

   *   **Input:** *N* independent requests.
   *   **Process:**
        *   Route each sub-request to a different intermediary service (Service A, Service B, Service C, etc.). The routing is not fixed; itâ€™s determined dynamically based on configurable policies (e.g., load balancing, geo-location, security level).
        *   The dynamic routing policy should be capable of avoiding routing *all* sub-requests through a single intermediary.
        *   Each intermediary service performs a trivial operation on its respective sub-payload (e.g., simple data transformation, timestamping, checksum calculation). The goal isn't functionality, but obfuscation and increased hop count.
   *   **Output:** Modified sub-requests routed to their respective destinations.

**3. Payload Reassembly Module:**

   *   **Input:** Responses from all intermediary services, each containing a modified sub-payload.
   *   **Process:**
        *   Receive responses from all intermediary services.
        *   Use the metadata embedded within each sub-payload to reassemble the original payload in the correct order.
        *   Perform error checking to ensure all sub-payloads were received and are valid.
   *   **Output:** Reconstructed original payload.

**4. Encryption Layer (Optional but Recommended):**

   *   Each sub-payload should be encrypted *before* being sent to the intermediary services. This adds an extra layer of security in case one of the intermediaries is compromised.  Use a symmetric key derived from a master key shared between the request originator and the reassembly module.

**Pseudocode (Reassembly Module):**

```
function reassemblePayload(responses):
  subPayloads = []
  for response in responses:
    subPayload = extractSubPayload(response)
    subPayloads.append(subPayload)

  # Sort subPayloads based on sequence number
  subPayloads.sort(key=lambda x: x.sequenceNumber)

  # Verify sequence numbers
  if not isValidSequence(subPayloads):
    return error("Invalid sequence detected")

  # Concatenate subPayloads to reconstruct original payload
  reconstructedPayload = concatenate(subPayloads)
  return reconstructedPayload
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   `N`: Number of sub-payloads to split the request into.
*   `splittingAlgorithm`: Algorithm used to divide the payload.
*   `routingPolicy`: Policy used to determine which intermediary service receives each sub-request.
*   `encryptionKey`: Encryption key used to encrypt sub-payloads.
*   `intermediaryServiceList`: List of available intermediary services.
