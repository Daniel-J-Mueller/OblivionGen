## Modular Acoustic Skins

**Concept:** Wireless speaker with interchangeable, magnetically-attached "acoustic skins" that radically alter sound dispersion and aesthetic profile.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Speaker Unit:** Cylindrical, 150mm diameter, 200mm height. Contains all drivers, amplifiers, wireless connectivity (Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6), and power supply (USB-C PD). Material: Primarily recycled aluminum alloy.
*   **Skin Interface:** 360-degree array of high-strength neodymium magnets embedded within the core speaker unit's outer surface. Magnet polarity consistently oriented.
*   **Skin Materials:**
    *   **Acoustic Foam (Standard):** Highly absorptive, diffuses sound for a wide, ambient listening experience. Available in multiple colors/textures.
    *   **Reflective Panel (Directional):** Smooth, rigid material (polished aluminum, acrylic) to reflect sound forward, creating a focused "spotlight" effect. Angle adjustable via a hidden mechanism.
    *   **Diffraction Grid (Spatial):**  Grid of precisely-spaced ridges/grooves molded into the skin material. Manipulates sound waves to create 3D audio effects. Ridge/groove spacing adjustable via a companion app.
    *   **Fabric Wrap (Absorbent/Aesthetic):**  Various fabric options (wool, silk, linen) bonded to a sound-absorbing backing. Primarily aesthetic, with minor acoustic properties.
    *   **Bio-Resin Composite (Organic):**  Sustainably sourced bio-resin with embedded natural fibers. Offers unique acoustic damping and visual texture.
*   **Skin Attachment:**  Magnetic attachment system. Skins snap onto the core speaker unit with a satisfying click. No visible fasteners.
*   **Skin Dimensions:** Diameter: 160mm. Thickness: 10-20mm (depending on material and acoustic properties).
*   **Companion App Integration:**
    *   **Skin Profiles:**  Stores pre-defined acoustic profiles for each skin material.
    *   **EQ Adjustment:**  Allows users to fine-tune the sound signature for each skin.
    *   **Spatial Audio Customization:** For diffraction grid skins, app controls ridge/groove spacing to adjust the spatial audio effect.
    *   **Skin Marketplace:** A platform for users to design and share custom skin designs.
*   **Power/Data:** Skin contains no active electronics. Power and data transfer are handled entirely by the core speaker unit.
*   **Manufacturing:** Skins are injection molded or 3D printed. Core speaker unit is assembled from standard components.

**Pseudocode (App - Diffraction Grid Control):**

```
function calculateRidgeSpacing(desiredSpatialWidth, frequency) {
  // Constants (determined through acoustic modeling)
  const speedOfSound = 343;
  const baseSpacing = 0.05; // Meters

  // Calculate wavelength
  const wavelength = speedOfSound / frequency;

  //Adjust ridge spacing based on desired spatial width and frequency
  const spatialFactor = desiredSpatialWidth / wavelength;

  const ridgeSpacing = baseSpacing * spatialFactor;

  return ridgeSpacing;
}

function updateGridParameters(desiredSpatialWidth, frequency) {
    const newRidgeSpacing = calculateRidgeSpacing(desiredSpatialWidth, frequency);
    //Send parameters to skin via bluetooth/wifi.
    sendToSkin("ridgeSpacing", newRidgeSpacing);
}
```

**Refinements:**

*   Skins could incorporate integrated mood lighting.
*   Develop a "pro" version of the skins with advanced acoustic materials and customizable diffusers.
*   Explore the use of generative algorithms to create unique skin designs.
*   Investigate the possibility of incorporating haptic feedback into the skins.
