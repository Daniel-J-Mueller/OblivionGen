## Dynamic Aesthetic Profile Generation & Projection

**Concept:** Extend image analysis beyond static criteria to create a continuously evolving "aesthetic profile" for a user, and then *project* that profile onto new images to predict user preference *before* they even see the image.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Acquisition Module:**
    *   Capture user interactions with digital images (likes, dislikes, edits, time spent viewing, sharing). Log *all* interactions.
    *   Integrate with metadata sources (location, time of day, camera settings) to build contextual data.
    *   Track user edits:  Not just ‘filter X applied’, but granular parameters – brightness adjustments, saturation curves, localized color corrections, cropping ratios, object masking/blurring.
    *   Implement eye-tracking integration (optional, but highly beneficial) to identify areas of focus within images.

2.  **Aesthetic Profile Builder:**
    *   Employ a multi-layered neural network.  Layer 1: Visual Feature Extraction (CNN pre-trained on ImageNet). Layer 2:  Non-Visual Feature Extraction (metadata, time-of-day, location). Layer 3:  Interaction/Behavioral Feature Extraction (edit history, viewing time, eye-tracking data).
    *   Dynamic Weighting:  Assign weights to different features based on their predictive power.  Weights are adjusted in real-time based on user interactions.
    *   Profile Representation: Represent the aesthetic profile as a high-dimensional vector. Each dimension corresponds to a specific aesthetic attribute (e.g., "warm color palettes", "high contrast", "rule of thirds composition", "natural lighting", "subject matter preference").
    *   Continuous Learning: The aesthetic profile is *never* static. It constantly evolves as the user interacts with more images.

3.  **Predictive Image Scoring Engine:**
    *   Analyze incoming images using the same visual feature extraction process as the profile builder.
    *   Calculate a “similarity score” between the image’s feature vector and the user’s aesthetic profile vector.  Use cosine similarity or a similar metric.
    *   Predictive Score: The similarity score is the predictive score – an estimate of how much the user will like the image.

4.  **Image Presentation Module:**
    *   Prioritized Display:  Present images to the user in descending order of their predictive scores.  This ensures that the user sees the images they are most likely to enjoy first.
    *   Personalized Filtering:  Allow the user to set a minimum predictive score threshold.  Images below this threshold are automatically filtered out.
    *   "Surprise Me" Mode:  Occasionally present images with lower predictive scores, but that exhibit novel aesthetic qualities that the user might not have encountered before. This encourages exploration and broadens the user’s aesthetic horizons.
    *   Real-Time Adaptation: The presentation module dynamically adjusts the prioritization and filtering based on the user’s ongoing interactions. If the user consistently rejects images with certain characteristics, the system learns to avoid them in the future.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Scoring):**

```
function calculatePredictiveScore(image, userProfile):
  imageFeatures = extractVisualFeatures(image)
  userPreferences = userProfile.aestheticPreferences
  similarityScore = cosineSimilarity(imageFeatures, userPreferences)
  return similarityScore

function displayImages(imageList, userProfile):
  sortedList = sort(imageList, by: calculatePredictiveScore(image, userProfile), descending: true)
  displayedImages = sortedList.slice(0, displayLimit)  // Limit the number of images displayed
  return displayedImages
```

**Novelty:** This differs from the patent’s focus on *analyzing* existing images based on predefined criteria. This system *predicts* user preference *before* the image is displayed, creating a truly personalized and dynamic visual experience. It moves beyond static aesthetic rules to learn and adapt to individual tastes in a continuous and nuanced way.
