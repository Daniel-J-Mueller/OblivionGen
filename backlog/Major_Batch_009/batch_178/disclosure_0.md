**Proximity-Based Dynamic Access Control for IoT Devices**

**Concept:** Extend the location-based security to a network of IoT devices, creating a dynamic access control system where device functionality is enabled/disabled based on proximity to a designated ‘home’ device (e.g., a smartphone, smart hub). This moves beyond just *shutting down* a device, and enables/disables *features* based on location.

**Specifications:**

*   **Device Roles:** Define two primary roles: ‘Anchor’ (typically user’s phone/hub) and ‘Peripheral’ (any IoT device – lights, locks, appliances, etc.).
*   **Proximity Zones:**  Establish configurable proximity zones around the Anchor device (e.g., “Home,” “Office,” “Away”).  These zones are defined by radius in meters.
*   **Feature Mapping:**  Allow users to map specific device features to proximity zones. For example:
    *   "Living Room Lights – On" when in “Home” zone.
    *   “Smart Lock – Unlock” when within 5 meters of the Anchor.
    *   "Thermostat - Eco Mode" when in "Away" zone.
    *   "Security Camera - Record" when the anchor device is not within any defined zones.
*   **Dynamic Rule Engine:** A rule engine within the Anchor device calculates feature activation based on:
    *   Anchor's current location (obtained via GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, Bluetooth beacons).
    *   Peripheral device’s supported features (discovered during initial pairing).
    *   User-defined feature mappings.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Utilize a low-power, short-range communication protocol (Bluetooth Low Energy, Zigbee, Thread) between the Anchor and Peripheral devices.
*   **Security:**
    *   End-to-end encryption of all communication.
    *   Secure pairing process to prevent unauthorized devices from joining the network.
    *   Regular key rotation.
*   **Fail-Safe Mechanism:** Implement a fail-safe mode where devices revert to a default state (e.g., lights on, locks unlocked) in case of communication failure or loss of Anchor device signal.

**Pseudocode (Rule Engine):**

```
function process_device(device) {
  anchor_location = get_anchor_location()
  device_location = get_device_location() // For devices with location awareness
  if (device_location == null) {
    device_location = anchor_location  // Assume same location as anchor
  }
  zone = determine_proximity_zone(anchor_location, device_location)
  rules = get_device_rules(device)

  for (rule in rules) {
    if (rule.zone == zone) {
      if (rule.action == "enable") {
        enable_device_feature(device, rule.feature)
      } else if (rule.action == "disable") {
        disable_device_feature(device, rule.feature)
      }
    }
  }
}

function determine_proximity_zone(anchor_location, device_location) {
  // Calculate distance between anchor and device
  distance = calculate_distance(anchor_location, device_location)

  if (distance <= 5) { // Example radius for "Home" zone
    return "Home"
  } else if (distance <= 50) { // Example radius for "Office" zone
    return "Office"
  } else {
    return "Away"
  }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Multi-Anchor Support:** Allow multiple Anchor devices (e.g., family members’ phones) to control the network.
*   **Geofencing:** Combine proximity-based control with geofencing to trigger actions based on entering/exiting predefined geographic areas.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Implement machine learning to automatically adjust proximity zone radii based on user behavior.
*   **Voice Control Integration:** Allow users to control the network using voice commands.
