## Adaptive Session Key Derivation with Biometric Anchoring

**Concept:** Extend the existing session security by dynamically adjusting the cryptographic key derivation function (KDF) based on real-time biometric data from the client. This creates a continuously evolving key, increasing resilience against key compromise and potentially allowing for proactive session termination if biometric signals indicate a change in user state.

**Specifications:**

**1. Biometric Data Acquisition & Processing Module (Client-Side):**

*   **Input:** Continuous stream of biometric data (e.g., heart rate variability (HRV), typing rhythm, mouse movement patterns, gait analysis via device sensors).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Real-time feature extraction from biometric data streams.
    *   Normalization and filtering of extracted features to remove noise and anomalies.
    *   Generation of a ‘biometric signature’ – a compact representation of the client’s current physiological/behavioral state.  This could be a vector of normalized feature values or a hash of the feature set.
    *   Secure transmission of the biometric signature to the server.  Encryption with a pre-shared key, derived during initial session establishment, is mandatory.
*   **Frequency:** Biometric signature transmission frequency configurable (e.g., 1-10 Hz). Higher frequency provides greater security but increases bandwidth usage.
*   **Failure Handling:** Implement fallback mechanisms in case of biometric data acquisition failures.  Option 1: Temporarily reduce key derivation complexity. Option 2: Session termination. Configurable.

**2. Adaptive Key Derivation Function (Server-Side):**

*   **Base KDF:**  Utilize a robust KDF (e.g., HKDF, Argon2) as the foundation.
*   **Input:**
    *   Shared Secret: Established during initial handshake.
    *   Session Parameters:  Values used in the original key exchange (e.g., Diffie-Hellman parameters, nonces).
    *   Biometric Signature: Received from the client.
    *   Timestamp:  Current server time.
*   **Derivation Process:**
    *   Concatenate the inputs above to create a combined input string.
    *   Pass the combined input through the base KDF to generate a new session key.
    *   Key rotation frequency configurable (e.g., every 1-60 seconds).
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement server-side anomaly detection to identify sudden changes in the biometric signature.  Trigger alerts or initiate session termination if anomalies exceed a configurable threshold.

**3. Secure Communication Protocol Modification:**

*   Modify the existing secure communication protocol to incorporate the biometric signature exchange and adaptive key derivation process.
*   Add a new message type for transmitting the biometric signature.
*   Define a standardized format for the biometric signature.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side Adaptive Key Derivation):**

```
function deriveSessionKey(sharedSecret, sessionParams, biometricSignature, timestamp):
  combinedInput = sharedSecret + sessionParams + biometricSignature + timestamp
  sessionKey = HKDF(combinedInput, salt, info) // Use a strong KDF
  return sessionKey
```

**Considerations:**

*   **Biometric Data Privacy:**  Ensure strict adherence to privacy regulations. Consider local processing of biometric data on the client-side before transmission.
*   **Computational Overhead:** Minimize the computational overhead of biometric processing and key derivation to avoid impacting performance.
*   **Synchronization:** Maintain accurate synchronization between client and server to ensure consistent key derivation.
*   **False Positives/Negatives:** Tune anomaly detection thresholds to minimize false positives (incorrectly triggering session termination) and false negatives (failing to detect compromised sessions).
*    **Sensor Spoofing:** Consider methods to detect sensor spoofing or manipulation attempts on the client side.
