## Acoustic Resonance Enhancement for RF Motion Detection

**Concept:** Integrate a micro-acoustic resonator network with the RF motion detection circuit to amplify subtle changes in the reflected RF signal caused by movement, even with minimal displacement. The existing patent focuses on direct RF reflection. This expands on that by *modulating* the RF signal through induced acoustic vibrations.

**Specs:**

*   **Resonator Material:** Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) micro-cantilever array, approximately 1mm x 1mm, 100 cantilever elements.
*   **Resonator Frequency:** Tuned to 40kHz - 60kHz. This range is sensitive to air pressure changes caused by even small movements.
*   **Integration:** The PZT array is mounted *within* the RF antenna housing, physically coupled to the antenna element but electrically isolated.
*   **Excitation:** A low-power, variable-frequency sinusoidal wave is applied to the PZT array. This causes the array to vibrate, creating a localized acoustic field.
*   **RF Modulation:** Movement in the environment causes subtle pressure variations in the acoustic field. These variations *modulate* the impedance of the antenna, changing the reflected RF signal.
*   **Signal Processing:** A dedicated amplifier and bandpass filter (centered on the modulated RF frequency) are added to the existing microcontroller circuitry.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   Establish a baseline acoustic profile (no motion).
    *   Monitor the amplitude and frequency shift of the amplified RF signal.
    *   Calculate the difference between the current signal and the baseline.
    *   Apply a threshold to detect significant deviations, indicating motion.
    *   Implement a Kalman filter to reduce noise and improve accuracy.
*   **Power:** <5mW for resonator excitation. System powered by existing battery source.
*   **Housing:** Existing RF motion detection housing adapted to accommodate PZT array and associated circuitry.
*   **Calibration:** Automated self-calibration routine to adjust excitation frequency and baseline profile based on environmental conditions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize PZT array and excitation signal
PZT_init()
excitation_signal_init(frequency = 45kHz, amplitude = 1V)

// Establish Baseline
baseline_profile = capture_RF_signal(duration = 5 seconds)
average_baseline = calculate_average(baseline_profile)

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    current_signal = capture_RF_signal(duration = 0.1 seconds)
    difference = current_signal - average_baseline

    //Apply Noise Reduction
    filtered_difference = kalman_filter(difference)

    if (abs(filtered_difference) > threshold) {
        motion_detected = true
        trigger_camera()
    } else {
        motion_detected = false
    }
}
```

**Innovation:**

This approach moves beyond solely detecting reflections to *actively sensing* changes in the environment through acoustic modulation of the RF signal.  The PZT array acts as a highly sensitive “ear” for the RF system, enabling the detection of extremely subtle movements. This is especially advantageous in scenarios where traditional RF-based motion detection may struggle due to low signal strength or cluttered environments. The self-calibration routine addresses potential environmental variations and ensures optimal performance.
