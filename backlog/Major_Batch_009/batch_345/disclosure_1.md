## Dynamic Granularity Sharding with Predictive Pre-Fetch

**Concept:** Extend the granularity level tracking by implementing a dynamic sharding strategy *based* on predicted query patterns, coupled with a pre-fetch mechanism for anticipated data access. This moves beyond simply *accessing* identified granularity levels, to proactively organizing and preparing data *before* a query even arrives.

**Specs:**

1.  **Query Pattern Analyzer:** A component that monitors incoming spatial queries, identifying frequently accessed regions (defined by granularity levels) and common query predicates (e.g., within a radius of X, intersects polygon Y). This builds a “heat map” of spatial access patterns.

2.  **Dynamic Sharding Engine:**  Based on the heat map, this engine dynamically shards the spatial index.  Instead of a static granularity level definition, it creates “virtual shards” that represent predicted high-access regions *across* multiple traditional granularity levels.  These shards are not necessarily contiguous in the underlying data structure.

3.  **Shard Metadata:**  Each shard is associated with metadata including:
    *   Shard ID
    *   Defining Spatial Extent (bounding box, polygon)
    *   Granularity Levels Comprising the Shard (pointers to underlying data)
    *   Access Frequency (updated by Query Pattern Analyzer)
    *   Pre-fetch Status (see below)

4.  **Pre-fetch Mechanism:** For shards with high access frequency, a pre-fetch mechanism loads data from those shards into a dedicated “warm cache” (e.g., in-memory or fast SSD). This is triggered either periodically or based on predicted query arrival (based on historical data).

5.  **Query Rewriter:**  Incoming spatial queries are intercepted by a Query Rewriter.  This component:
    *   Analyzes the query’s spatial extent.
    *   Identifies which virtual shards intersect the query.
    *   Rewrites the query to access *only* those shards.
    *   If a shard is not in the warm cache, it issues a request to load it.

**Pseudocode (Query Rewriter):**

```
function rewriteQuery(spatialQuery):
  queryExtent = getSpatialExtent(spatialQuery)
  intersectingShards = findShardsIntersecting(queryExtent)

  if intersectingShards is empty:
    // Fallback to full scan (or appropriate default)
    return originalQuery

  // Load shards not in warm cache
  for shard in intersectingShards:
    if shard not in warmCache:
      loadShardIntoCache(shard)

  // Rewrite query to target only intersecting shards
  rewrittenQuery = createShardTargetedQuery(spatialQuery, intersectingShards)
  return rewrittenQuery
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Shard Table:**  A hash table or similar structure mapping shard IDs to shard metadata.
*   **Warm Cache:**  An in-memory or SSD-based cache storing pre-fetched shard data.
*   **Heat Map:** A spatial data structure (e.g., quadtree, R-tree) representing query access frequency.



**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significant reduction in query latency, especially for frequently accessed regions.
*   Improved scalability by distributing workload across shards.
*   Proactive data preparation reduces the need for on-demand data access.
*   Adaptability to changing query patterns.
