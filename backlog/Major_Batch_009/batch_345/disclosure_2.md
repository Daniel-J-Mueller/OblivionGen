## Adaptive Threat Response via Dynamic Graph Mutation

**Concept:** Extend the threat model generation by not just *identifying* risks based on the graph, but by allowing the graph itself to *mutate* in response to detected anomalies, creating a self-evolving security posture. This moves beyond static analysis towards a predictive and adaptive defense.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Graph Structure:**

*   **Nodes:** Represent system entities (processes, services, files, network connections, user accounts, etc.). Nodes store attribute data (permissions, integrity hashes, resource usage, connection counts).
*   **Edges:**  Represent relationships between entities (process calls another, file accessed by process, network connection between IPs). Edges store metadata (frequency of interaction, data transfer size, timestamp of last interaction).
*   **Edge/Node Weighting:** Assign weights to edges and nodes reflecting their criticality/sensitivity. High-weight nodes/edges represent core system functions or sensitive data flows.

**2. Anomaly Detection Module:**

*   **Behavioral Profiling:** Establish baseline behavior for each node and edge (resource usage patterns, communication frequencies, data transfer characteristics). Use statistical methods (e.g., time series analysis, anomaly detection algorithms) to identify deviations from the baseline.
*   **Correlation Engine:** Identify correlated anomalies across multiple nodes and edges. A single anomaly might be benign, but a combination of anomalies could indicate a coordinated attack.
*   **Risk Scoring:** Assign a risk score to each anomaly based on its severity, frequency, correlation with other anomalies, and the weight of the affected nodes/edges.

**3. Dynamic Graph Mutation Engine:**

*   **Edge Forging:** If an anomalous communication pattern is detected (e.g., a process communicating with an unknown IP address), *forge* a new edge in the graph representing this connection, but with a low weight and a 'suspicious' flag. This allows the system to monitor the connection without immediately blocking it.
*   **Edge Severing:** If a connection is confirmed to be malicious (e.g., through intrusion detection systems or threat intelligence feeds), *sever* the corresponding edge in the graph. This isolates the malicious entity.
*   **Node Splitting:** If a node exhibits highly anomalous behavior and cannot be reliably attributed to a known entity, *split* the node into multiple nodes, each representing a potential sub-entity or compromise. This allows for granular monitoring and containment.
*   **Node Merging:** If multiple nodes exhibit similar anomalous behavior and are likely related, *merge* them into a single node representing a consolidated threat.
*   **Weight Adjustment:** Continuously adjust the weights of nodes and edges based on detected anomalies and threat intelligence data. High-risk nodes/edges should have their weights increased, while benign entities should have their weights decreased.

**4. Predictive Threat Modeling:**

*   **Graph Traversal:** Use graph traversal algorithms (e.g., shortest path, centrality measures) to identify potential attack vectors and critical vulnerabilities.
*   **Simulation:** Simulate potential attacks on the graph to assess the effectiveness of existing security controls and identify areas for improvement.
*   **Proactive Mitigation:** Based on the simulation results, proactively implement security rules and policies to mitigate potential risks.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Graph Mutation Engine):**

```
function mutateGraph(graph, anomalyData) {
  if (anomalyData.type == "newConnection") {
    addEdge(graph, anomalyData.source, anomalyData.destination, weight: 0.1, flag: "suspicious")
  } else if (anomalyData.type == "maliciousConnection") {
    removeEdge(graph, anomalyData.source, anomalyData.destination)
  } else if (anomalyData.type == "compromisedNode") {
    splitNode(graph, anomalyData.nodeId) // Create multiple sub-nodes
  } else if (anomalyData.type == "correlatedAnomalies") {
    mergeNodes(graph, anomalyData.nodeIds)
  } else {
    adjustNodeWeight(graph, anomalyData.nodeId, anomalyData.weightChange)
    adjustEdgeWeight(graph, anomalyData.edgeId, anomalyData.weightChange)
  }

  return graph
}
```

**Output:** A continuously evolving threat model that adapts to changing attack patterns and provides a more resilient and proactive security posture. This system allows for granular threat containment and enables more effective security response.
