## Dynamic Authentication & Predictive Security System

**System Overview:** This system builds upon the concept of dynamic authentication triggered by location/behavior anomalies, but layers in *predictive* security measures based on established user routines and anticipates potential theft *before* it occurs.  It moves beyond simply reacting to a potentially stolen device and proactively safeguards data.

**Core Components:**

*   **Routine Learning Engine (RLE):**  Constantly monitors and learns the user’s typical device usage patterns. This includes:
    *   **Location History:** Regularly tracked GPS coordinates.
    *   **App Usage:**  Frequency, duration, and time of day for each application.
    *   **Communication Patterns:** Who the user typically communicates with and when.
    *   **Network Connections:**  Typical Wi-Fi networks used and connection times.
*   **Anomaly Detection Module (ADM):**  Compares current device behavior against the RLE’s established baseline. Flags deviations as potential security risks.  Severity levels are assigned based on the degree of deviation.
*   **Predictive Security Protocol (PSP):**  Activated when the ADM detects anomalies. This is where the system moves beyond simple challenges. The PSP utilizes a tiered approach:
    *   **Tier 1 - Subtle Verification:**  If the anomaly is minor (e.g., using the device at an unusual time), the system initiates a subtle verification step – a push notification asking "Is this you?" with a simple Yes/No option.  This is designed to be non-intrusive.
    *   **Tier 2 – Behavioral Biometrics:** If Tier 1 fails or the anomaly is more significant, the system initiates behavioral biometrics authentication. This goes beyond passwords and relies on unique user interactions:
        *   **Typing Rhythm Analysis:** Tracks typing speed, pauses, and common errors.
        *   **Swiping/Scrolling Patterns:** Analyzes the user’s typical interaction with the touchscreen.
        *   **App Launch Sequences:** The order in which the user typically opens applications.
    *   **Tier 3 – Proactive Lockdown & Remote Wipe Initiation:**  If Tier 2 fails or the anomaly suggests an immediate threat (e.g., rapid location changes consistent with theft), the system initiates a complete lockdown. This includes:
        *   Disabling all access to sensitive data.
        *   Initiating a remote wipe of the device.
        *   Activating a loud, attention-grabbing alarm (independent of the audible alert in the original patent).
*   **Geofence Prediction Engine (GPE):**  This module analyzes the user's historical location data to *predict* future locations. If the device deviates from the predicted path, it triggers the PSP. The GPE differs from a standard geofence in that it is dynamic and adjusts to the user's changing routines.
*   **Decoy Data Injection (DDI):** Periodically injects fake data into commonly accessed accounts and files. If the device is compromised and the attacker accesses this data, it triggers an alert and provides valuable information about the intrusion.

**Pseudocode - Core Logic:**

```
// Main Loop
while (device_is_on) {
  current_behavior = capture_device_behavior();
  expected_behavior = RLE.predict_behavior();

  anomaly_score = ADM.calculate_anomaly_score(current_behavior, expected_behavior);

  if (anomaly_score > threshold) {
    // Activate Predictive Security Protocol
    if (anomaly_score < critical_threshold) {
      // Tier 1: Subtle Verification
      send_subtle_verification_notification();
      response = await_notification_response();
      if (response == negative) {
        activate_tier_2();
      }
    } else {
      activate_tier_2(); // Bypass Tier 1 if critical anomaly
    }
  }
}

// Activate Tier 2 (Behavioral Biometrics)
function activate_tier_2() {
  biometric_data = capture_behavioral_biometrics();
  if (biometric_data != expected_biometrics) {
    // Initiate lockdown & remote wipe
    initiate_lockdown_and_wipe();
  }
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   GPS module
*   Accelerometer/Gyroscope (for motion detection)
*   Secure Enclave (for storing sensitive data and biometric information)
*   Fast processor for real-time analysis

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with a trusted contacts network – automatically notify designated contacts if the device is potentially stolen.
*   Machine learning to refine the anomaly detection algorithms and improve accuracy.
*   Cloud-based analysis to leverage larger datasets and identify emerging threats.
