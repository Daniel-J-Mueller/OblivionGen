## Adaptive Notification ‘Bubbles’ – Contextual Spatial Audio & Visuals

**Concept:** Expanding upon the contextual notification awareness, instead of simply varying alert *types*, create dynamic, spatially-aware notification ‘bubbles’ that emanate from the *source* of the notification, even across multiple devices. These bubbles exist in the user's perceived space, blending audio and visual cues.

**Specs:**

*   **Core System:** A distributed system running on all linked devices (smart TV, phone, laptop, etc.). Requires a baseline understanding of device positions (via Bluetooth beaconing, Wi-Fi triangulation, or camera-based positioning).
*   **Notification Origin:** When a notification arrives, the system determines the originating application/service.
*   **Spatial Audio Engine:**  A spatial audio engine that simulates sound emanating from the originating device.  If a notification originates on a phone, the sound *appears* to come from the phone’s physical location. The volume decreases with distance, and occlusion is simulated (sound dampened if ‘behind’ an object detected via camera).
*   **Visual Bubble Generation:** A semi-transparent, dynamically sized 'bubble' is projected visually (via screen display or, ideally, AR projection) around the originating device. The bubble’s color and animation indicate the notification type (e.g., red pulsing for urgent, blue for informational).
*   **Contextual Bubble Adaptation:** The bubble's size, color, animation, and audio characteristics are adjusted based on contextual information, building on the original patent:
    *   **User Gaze:** If the user is looking *at* the originating device, the bubble is more prominent and the audio more directional.
    *   **Device Proximity:** The bubble shrinks as the user approaches the originating device.
    *   **User Activity:** If the user is in a meeting (calendar integration), bubbles are muted and/or minimized.
    *   **Moving Devices:** Bubbles “follow” devices as they move (within the perceived space).
*   **Interaction Model:**
    *   **Gaze-Activated Details:** Looking at a bubble for a set duration expands it to reveal a brief notification summary.
    *   **Gesture Control:** Air gestures (if AR-capable) allow dismissing or expanding notifications.
    *   **Haptic Feedback:** Devices within proximity to the bubble provide subtle haptic feedback.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Notification Handling):**

```
function handleNotification(notificationData, originatingDevice) {
    devicePosition = getDevicePosition(originatingDevice);
    userGazePosition = getUserGazePosition(); //From head/eye tracking
    distance = calculateDistance(devicePosition, userGazePosition);

    bubbleSize = baseBubbleSize * (1 - (distance / maxDistance));
    bubbleColor = determineBubbleColor(notificationType);
    audioVolume = calculateAudioVolume(distance);

    renderBubble(originatingDevice.screen, bubbleSize, bubbleColor);
    playSpatialAudio(originatingDevice.speaker, audioVolume, notificationSound);
}

function calculateAudioVolume(distance) {
  //Apply inverse square law + occlusion
  volume = 1.0 / (distance * distance);
  //Occlusion check (requires scene understanding via camera)
  if(isOccluded(originatingDevice, userGazePosition)){
      volume *= 0.5;
  }
  return volume;
}

```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-Device Coordination:**  Notifications can ‘flow’ between devices. For example, a calendar reminder could start as a bubble on a TV, then migrate to a phone as the user leaves the house.
*   **Personalized Bubble Aesthetics:** Allow users to customize bubble colors, animations, and sounds.
*   **Environmental Awareness:** Integrate with smart home data to adjust bubble behavior based on lighting, noise levels, and other environmental factors.
