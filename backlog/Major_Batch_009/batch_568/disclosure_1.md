## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Temporal Echo Mapping

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple sound source *localization* to create a dynamic, temporally-aware “echo map” of the environment. This map isn't just about *where* sounds come from, but *how* sound propagates and reflects within a space over time. Imagine a 3D volumetric representation where the intensity and delay of echoes are continuously updated.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Minimum of 8 synchronized microphones, optimally arranged in a spherical or dodecahedral configuration for omnidirectional coverage. Include inertial measurement units (IMUs) integrated with each microphone to precisely track their position and orientation, compensating for movement or vibration.
*   **Data Acquisition:** High sample rate (minimum 96 kHz) with at least 24-bit resolution for accurate capture of transient sounds and subtle reflections.
*   **Processing Modules:**
    *   **TDOA Estimation:** Utilize a generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) for robust TDOA calculation, modified to handle non-stationary noise and reverberation. Explore wavelet-based TDOA estimation for improved time resolution.
    *   **Echo Decomposition:** Employ a blind source separation (BSS) algorithm (e.g., independent component analysis (ICA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)) adapted for acoustic echo separation. The goal is to isolate individual reflections and estimate their time of arrival relative to the direct sound.
    *   **Temporal Echo Mapping:** Construct a volumetric grid representing the environment. Each voxel stores:
        *   Echo Intensity: A measure of the energy of the echo within that voxel.
        *   Time-of-Flight (TOF): The estimated time delay between the direct sound and the echo.
        *   Direction-of-Arrival (DOA): The estimated direction from which the echo originates.
        *   Material Properties (estimated): An estimate of the surface's reflective properties (e.g., absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient). This would involve machine learning models trained on known materials and their acoustic signatures.
    *   **Dynamic Map Update:** Implement a recursive Bayesian filter to continuously update the echo map as new sound events occur. This allows the map to adapt to changes in the environment (e.g., moving objects, opening doors).
*   **Output:** A dynamic 3D echo map visualized as a volumetric rendering. Users can interact with the map to explore the acoustic environment, isolate individual echoes, and analyze sound propagation patterns.

**Pseudocode (Map Update):**

```
// Input: New acoustic data from sensor array
//       Current Echo Map
// Output: Updated Echo Map

function updateEchoMap(acousticData, echoMap) {

    // 1. Estimate TDOA for each microphone pair
    tdoa = estimateTDOA(acousticData);

    // 2. Decompose acoustic data into direct sound and echoes
    [directSound, echoes] = decomposeAcousticData(acousticData, tdoa);

    // 3. For each echo:
    for each echo in echoes {
        // 4. Estimate echo source location using TDOA and microphone positions
        echoLocation = estimateEchoLocation(echo, microphonePositions);

        // 5. Update echo map voxel:
        voxel = echoMap.getVoxel(echoLocation);
        voxel.intensity += echo.energy;
        voxel.timeOfFlight = echo.timeOfFlight;
        voxel.directionOfArrival = echo.directionOfArrival;
        // Optionally: Update material properties based on echo characteristics
        voxel.materialProperties = updateMaterialProperties(voxel.materialProperties, echo);
        echoMap.setVoxel(voxel);
    }

    // 6. Apply smoothing and noise reduction filters to the echo map

    return echoMap;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Audio Conferencing:** Noise cancellation and echo reduction based on real-time echo map analysis.
*   **Acoustic Scene Understanding:** Automated identification of objects and materials within a space based on their acoustic signatures.
*   **Virtual and Augmented Reality:** Realistic sound rendering and spatial audio effects based on accurate echo map modeling.
*   **Security and Surveillance:** Detection of anomalous sounds or activities based on deviations from the expected echo map.
*   **Architectural Acoustics:** Design and optimization of spaces for optimal sound quality.
