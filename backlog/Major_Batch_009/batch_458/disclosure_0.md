## Dynamic RF Energy Harvesting & Signal Boost

**Concept:** Integrate RF energy harvesting into the receiver’s analog front end to supplement or even *power* the low-noise amplifier (LNA) or dynamically adjust impedance matching networks for improved signal reception, and potentially extend battery life or even enable battery-less operation. This builds on the dynamic path selection concept but introduces an active energy component.

**Specifications:**

*   **Energy Harvesting Module:**
    *   Frequency Range: 700 MHz – 2.7 GHz (adaptable via software configuration)
    *   Antenna: Integrated planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) – small footprint, optimized for near-field RF scavenging.
    *   Rectifier: Multi-stage charge pump with voltage multiplier. Output regulation to 3.3V/1.8V.
    *   Storage: Micro-battery or supercapacitor (selectable based on power requirements and lifecycle considerations).
    *   Power Management IC (PMIC):  Handles charging, discharging, and voltage regulation.  Includes overvoltage/overcurrent protection.

*   **Dynamic Impedance Matching Network (DIMN):**
    *   Technology:  MEMS-based tunable capacitors and inductors.
    *   Control: Digital control via microcontroller (integrated into PMIC).
    *   Frequency Range: 700 MHz - 2.7 GHz
    *   Resolution:  1 dB step size
    *   Algorithm:  Continuous impedance matching optimization based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and error vector magnitude (EVM). The DIMN will also be integrated with the energy harvesting module.

*   **LNA Integration:**
    *   Control: The PMIC dynamically adjusts the LNA bias current based on available harvested energy and RSSI.  Higher energy = higher bias current = higher gain.
    *   Switching: LNA can be selectively powered by harvested energy OR battery power (with seamless switching).

*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Energy Management Algorithm: Prioritizes critical functions (signal amplification) over less critical ones.
    *   Adaptive Learning: The system learns the RF environment and adjusts the energy harvesting and signal boosting strategies accordingly.
    *   Diagnostic Reporting: Provides real-time data on harvested energy, LNA performance, and system health.

**Pseudocode (Energy Management Algorithm):**

```
LOOP
    Read RSSI, Battery Level, Harvested Energy
    IF RSSI < Threshold AND Battery Level < LowThreshold
        Enable LNA with maximum bias (using Battery OR Harvested Energy)
        Adjust DIMN for optimal signal reception
    ELSE IF Harvested Energy > ActivationThreshold
        Enable LNA with optimized bias (using Harvested Energy)
        Adjust DIMN for optimal signal reception
        Reduce Battery Usage (if applicable)
    ELSE
        Maintain current settings
    ENDIF
    Monitor System Health and Log Data
ENDLOOP
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple path selection by actively *creating* a power source to improve reception, potentially enabling new applications for low-power devices and extending operating lifetimes. It’s a symbiotic relationship where the receiver both receives a signal *and* scavenges power from the surrounding RF environment. The dynamic impedance matching network integrated with the energy harvesting module is novel because it creates a self-optimizing system.
