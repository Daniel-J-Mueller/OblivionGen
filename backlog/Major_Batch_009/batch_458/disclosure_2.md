## Dynamic GPU Partitioning & Task Swapping

**Specification:** Implement a system for dynamically partitioning a physical GPU into multiple independent ‘slices’, and swapping execution contexts (tasks) between these slices *during* application runtime. This builds upon the idea of virtual GPUs but moves beyond static allocation to truly dynamic resource management.

**Core Components:**

*   **GPU Partitioning Module:** Software responsible for dividing the physical GPU’s resources (CUDA cores, memory bandwidth, cache) into configurable slices.  Partitioning isn’t fixed; slice sizes are adjustable in real-time.
*   **Task Context Manager:** A module to capture and restore the complete execution state of a task – including register values, memory pointers, and instruction addresses. Lightweight context switching is critical.
*   **Workload Analyzer:** Continuously monitors GPU utilization for each running task.  Identifies tasks that are underutilized or hitting resource bottlenecks.
*   **Scheduler & Swapper:** Based on the Workload Analyzer’s data, the scheduler determines if a task should be moved to a different GPU slice (or have its slice resized). The swapper executes the context switch.
*   **Virtualization Layer:** Provides a consistent interface to applications, abstracting the underlying dynamic partitioning.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop (Runs per time slice)

FOR EACH Task IN RunningTaskList:
    WorkloadData = WorkloadAnalyzer.Analyze(Task)
    IF WorkloadData.Utilization < Threshold AND AnotherTask.Utilization > HighThreshold:
        // Task is underutilized, another is overloaded

        // 1. Identify a suitable slice to move the overloaded task to.
        TargetSlice = FindAvailableSlice(OverloadedTask.ResourceRequirements)

        IF TargetSlice != NULL:
            // 2. Save the state of the overloaded task
            OverloadedTaskState = TaskContextManager.SaveState(OverloadedTask)

            // 3. Move task to the TargetSlice.
            MoveTask(OverloadedTask, TargetSlice)

            // 4. Restore the saved state of the moved task
            TaskContextManager.RestoreState(OverloadedTask, OverloadedTaskState)

            // 5. Resize original slice for underutilized task
            ResizeSlice(UnderutilizedTask, NewSize)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires a GPU architecture that supports fine-grained resource partitioning (e.g., a future generation of NVIDIA’s Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology).
*   High-bandwidth interconnect between GPU slices to minimize data transfer overhead.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased GPU Utilization:** By dynamically shifting tasks to available resources, overall GPU utilization can be maximized.
*   **Improved Application Responsiveness:** Tasks facing resource contention can be moved to less crowded slices, improving responsiveness.
*   **Enhanced Multi-Tenancy:** Allows for more efficient sharing of GPU resources among multiple users or applications.
*   **Adaptive Performance:**  The system can adapt to changing workloads in real-time, providing consistent performance.

**Novelty:**

Existing virtual GPU solutions typically offer static resource allocation. This design enables *runtime* adjustment of GPU resources, moving beyond static division and allowing for true dynamic optimization. It is a reactive system which responds to application needs, rather than pre-allocating resources.
