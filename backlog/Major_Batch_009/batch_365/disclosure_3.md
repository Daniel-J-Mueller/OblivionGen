## Dynamic CDN Tiering Based on Content Sentiment & User Engagement

**Concept:** Extend the existing CDN selection logic to incorporate real-time content sentiment analysis and user engagement metrics. Instead of *only* reacting to network usage thresholds, proactively shift content delivery based on *how* users are interacting with it.  This aims to optimize not just cost/bandwidth, but also user experience and potentially viral content distribution.

**Specs:**

**1. Sentiment & Engagement Data Acquisition:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate with social media APIs (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit), comment sections, and website analytics (time on page, bounce rate, shares, likes).
*   **Sentiment Analysis Engine:**  Employ a machine learning model to analyze text-based content (comments, social media posts) for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). Assign a sentiment score to each piece of content.
*   **Engagement Metrics:** Track key engagement metrics in real-time:
    *   **Viral Velocity:** Rate of shares/likes/comments over a short period.
    *   **Comment Sentiment:** Aggregate sentiment score of comments associated with content.
    *   **Time-Based Engagement:** Track engagement trends over time (e.g., spike in engagement after a certain event).

**2. Tiered CDN Infrastructure:**

*   **Tier 1 (Premium):** High-performance CDN with low latency, advanced caching features, and geographically diverse POPs. Reserved for content exhibiting:
    *   High positive sentiment.
    *   Rapidly increasing viral velocity.
    *   High user engagement (long time on page, low bounce rate).
*   **Tier 2 (Standard):**  Balanced performance and cost. Used for most content.
*   **Tier 3 (Economy):**  Lowest cost, potentially lower performance.  Reserved for content with:
    *   Negative sentiment.
    *   Low engagement.
    *   Stale content.

**3. Dynamic CDN Selection Logic:**

```pseudocode
function selectCDNTier(contentID):
  sentimentScore = getSentimentScore(contentID)
  viralVelocity = getViralVelocity(contentID)
  engagementScore = getEngagementScore(contentID)

  if sentimentScore > 0.7 and viralVelocity > 0.5 and engagementScore > 0.8:
    return "Tier 1"
  elif sentimentScore < -0.3 or engagementScore < 0.2:
    return "Tier 3"
  else:
    return "Tier 2"
```

**4. Real-time Monitoring & Adjustment:**

*   **Monitoring Dashboard:**  Visualize CDN tier distribution, content sentiment, and engagement metrics.
*   **Automated Adjustment:** Implement a system that automatically shifts content between CDN tiers based on the real-time data.
*   **Threshold Configuration:** Allow administrators to configure the thresholds for sentiment, viral velocity, and engagement that trigger tier changes.

**5.  Cache Invalidation Enhancement:**

*   Content moving *down* tiers (e.g., from Tier 1 to Tier 2) triggers a more aggressive cache invalidation on Tier 1 nodes to free up resources for more actively trending content. Conversely, content moving *up* tiers benefits from prioritized cache population on the upgraded CDN.
