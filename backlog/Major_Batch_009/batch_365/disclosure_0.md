## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Multi-Device Audio

**Concept:** Extend the multi-device audio control to incorporate localized haptic feedback, creating a more immersive and nuanced experience. The system detects speech characteristics *and* semantic content to dynamically modulate haptic feedback on wearable devices (watches, bracelets, clothing) synchronized with audio output across multiple devices.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Wearable haptic devices with a range of actuators (vibration motors, linear resonant actuators, electro-tactile stimulators). Minimum of 6 actuators per device.
    *   Microphone array on the primary input device (phone, smart speaker) for accurate speech analysis.
    *   Multi-device audio output system (speakers, headphones) as currently defined.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Speech Analysis Module:** Extracts features from input audio: volume, pitch, tone, rate of speech, and identified keywords/semantic intent.  Utilizes a pre-trained model for speech emotion recognition.
    *   **Haptic Mapping Module:**  Translates speech features and semantic intent into haptic patterns.  This is a configurable mapping – allowing users to personalize the experience. Example mappings:
        *   *Whispered Speech:* Gentle, localized vibration on the wrist closest to the primary audio source.
        *   *Loud Speech/Command:* Stronger, more widespread vibration, potentially incorporating directional cues.
        *   *Specific Keywords (e.g., "bass," "treble," "volume"):* Haptic pulses corresponding to frequency ranges, felt on different parts of the arm or torso.
        *   *Emotional Tone (e.g., anger, joy):* Different haptic textures and rhythms.
    *   **Synchronization Engine:**  Ensures precise timing between audio output and haptic feedback across all devices.  Uses a network time protocol (NTP) server for synchronization.
    *   **User Profile Management:** Stores user preferences for haptic mappings, intensity levels, and device configurations.
*   **Pseudocode (Haptic Mapping Logic):**

```
function generateHapticPattern(speechFeatures, semanticIntent, userProfile) {
  // Retrieve user-defined haptic preferences
  preferences = userProfile.getHapticPreferences();

  // Analyze speech characteristics
  volume = speechFeatures.volume;
  pitch = speechFeatures.pitch;
  emotion = speechFeatures.emotion;

  // Determine base haptic pattern
  basePattern = preferences.getBasePattern(emotion);

  // Modify base pattern based on volume
  if (volume > thresholdHigh) {
    basePattern.intensity = maxIntensity;
    basePattern.spread = maxSpread;
  } else if (volume < thresholdLow) {
    basePattern.intensity = minIntensity;
    basePattern.spread = minSpread;
  }

  // Add keyword-specific haptic elements
  if (semanticIntent.contains("bass")) {
    basePattern.addFrequencyPulse(60, wrist);
  }
  if (semanticIntent.contains("treble")) {
    basePattern.addFrequencyPulse(2000, forearm);
  }

  // Adjust intensity based on user profile
  finalIntensity = basePattern.intensity * userProfile.intensityMultiplier;

  return basePattern;
}
```

*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Synchronized Audio/Haptic:**  Primary mode – audio and haptic feedback operate in tandem.
    *   **Haptic-Only Alerts:**  Use haptic feedback to provide discreet notifications (e.g., incoming calls, messages) without audio.
    *   **Immersive Mode:**  Utilize a wider range of haptic actuators and more complex patterns to create a fully immersive audio experience (e.g., simulating the feel of instruments in music).

This system goes beyond simply changing audio output; it adds a tactile dimension, enhancing immersion and providing a more personalized and intuitive user experience. It would require a novel method for generating and synchronizing haptic patterns with complex audio streams.
