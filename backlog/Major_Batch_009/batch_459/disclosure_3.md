## Dynamic Authentication Credential 'Lifespans' & Behavioral Biometrics Integration

**Concept:** Expand upon the credential uniqueness verification system by introducing dynamically adjusting credential lifespans based on user behavior *and* integrating behavioral biometrics as an ongoing authentication factor. This moves beyond simply verifying uniqueness at credential creation to continuously assessing risk and adjusting access permissions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Biometric Profile Creation & Monitoring Module:**

*   **Data Inputs:**  Keyboard dynamics (typing speed, pressure, rhythm), mouse movement (speed, acceleration, patterns), touchscreen interaction (pressure, swipe speed, multi-touch gestures), device orientation data, application usage patterns.
*   **Profile Generation:**  Establish baseline behavioral profiles for each user during initial usage. This should occur transparently during normal application interaction.  Employ a machine learning model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model, Recurrent Neural Network) to capture subtle behavioral variations.
*   **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:**  Continuously monitor user behavior and compare it against the established baseline profile. Implement a scoring system â€“ higher scores indicate greater deviation.

**2. Dynamic Credential Lifespan Adjustment Engine:**

*   **Risk Score Integration:**  Combine the behavioral anomaly score with other risk factors (e.g., location, time of access, device type, network conditions).
*   **Lifespan Calculation:** Map the combined risk score to a credential lifespan range (e.g., high risk = lifespan of minutes, low risk = lifespan of months).
*   **Automated Credential Rotation:**  Automatically trigger credential rotation (password change, biometric re-scan) when the lifespan expires or the risk score exceeds a predefined threshold.  Rotation should happen *before* a breach, not after.
*   **Granular Lifespan Control:**  Allow administrators to define different lifespan policies for different applications or data sets. Critical systems get shorter lifespans.

**3. Enhanced Verification Workflow:**

*   **Initial Verification:** Use the existing patent's system to verify the uniqueness of the initially requested credential.
*   **Continuous Authentication:** After initial verification, replace traditional static authentication with a continuous stream of behavioral biometric data. 
*   **Step-Up Authentication:**  If behavioral anomalies are detected, trigger a 'step-up' authentication challenge (e.g., two-factor authentication, knowledge-based questions) *before* access is granted.
*    **Adaptive Security Thresholds**: Implement machine learning to adapt security thresholds based on observed usage patterns, reducing false positives and improving user experience. 

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
FUNCTION authenticateUser(userID, requestedCredential):
    // Initial Uniqueness Verification (from patent)
    IF !verifyCredentialUniqueness(requestedCredential):
        RETURN ACCESS_DENIED

    // Create Behavioral Profile (if not exists)
    profile = getBehavioralProfile(userID)
    IF profile == NULL:
        initializeBehavioralProfile(userID)

    // Continuous Authentication Loop
    WHILE accessGranted:
        behaviorData = collectBehavioralData()
        anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(behaviorData, profile)
        
        IF anomalyScore > threshold:
            // Step-Up Authentication
            challengeResult = performStepUpAuthentication()
            IF challengeResult == FAILED:
                RETURN ACCESS_DENIED
        
        credentialLifespan = calculateCredentialLifespan(anomalyScore)
        IF credentialLifespanExpired():
            // Trigger Credential Rotation
            triggerCredentialRotation()

        // Grant Access
        grantAccess()

        // Wait for next interaction
        wait()

    // Access Denied
    RETURN ACCESS_DENIED
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:**  Ensure that behavioral data is collected and processed in compliance with privacy regulations. Anonymization and data minimization are crucial.
*   **Usability:**  Balance security with usability. Excessive authentication challenges can frustrate users.
*   **Scalability:**  The system must be able to handle a large number of users and devices.
*   **Device Compatibility:** Support a wide range of devices and operating systems.
