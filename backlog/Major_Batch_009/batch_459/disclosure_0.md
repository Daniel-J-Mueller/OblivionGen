## Secure Data Attestation via Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) & Verifiable Credentials

**Concept:** Extend the existing signed envelope encryption scheme with a decentralized identity layer using DIDs and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to enhance trust and auditability, while removing reliance on centralized key management.

**Specifications:**

**1. Component Overview:**

*   **Issuer:** A trusted entity (could be the cryptography service) responsible for issuing VCs to clients.
*   **Holder:** The client initiating the secure communication.
*   **Verifier:** The receiving system (second system in the original patent).
*   **DID Document:** A JSON-LD document containing the Holder's DID, public keys, and service endpoints. Stored on a decentralized ledger (e.g., blockchain, distributed hash table).
*   **Verifiable Credential (VC):** A digitally signed assertion by the Issuer attesting to the Holder's identity and authorized cryptographic keys.
*   **Encrypted Data Envelope:** Contains the encrypted message, digital signature, and attestation (as defined in the original patent).

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **DID Provisioning:** Holder generates a DID and publishes its DID Document to a decentralized ledger.
2.  **Credential Issuance:** Holder requests a VC from the Issuer. The Issuer verifies the Holder’s identity and issues a VC containing the Holder’s public key(s) used for encryption and signing.
3.  **Data Encryption & Signing:** The Holder encrypts the data using a symmetric key. The Holder then generates a digital signature of the encrypted data using its private key. The Holder packages the encrypted data, signature, and an attestation encoding the public key and ciphertext of the symmetric key.
4.  **Credential Presentation:** Along with the encrypted data envelope, the Holder presents a digitally signed VC to the Verifier.
5.  **Verification & Trust Establishment:**
    *   The Verifier retrieves the Holder’s DID Document from the decentralized ledger using the DID embedded in the VC.
    *   The Verifier verifies the signature on the VC using the Issuer’s public key (obtained from the Issuer’s DID Document or a trusted source).
    *   The Verifier validates the VC's claims – specifically, the Holder’s public key used for encryption and signing matches the one presented in the VC.
    *   The Verifier verifies the digital signature on the encrypted message, using the public key from the validated VC.
    *   If all verifications pass, the Verifier trusts the authenticity of the data and decrypts the message.

**3.  Data Structures (JSON-LD Example):**

**VC Example:**

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
  "@type": "VerifiableCredential",
  "issuer": "did:example:issuer",
  "issuanceDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:holder",
    "publicKey": [
      {
        "type": "EC",
        "key": "0x..."
      }
    ]
  },
  "signature": {
    "type": "ECDSA",
    "data": "...",
    "signature": "..."
  }
}
```

**4. Pseudocode (Verifier Side):**

```
function verifyData(encryptedData, vc):
  didDocument = retrieveDIDDocument(vc.credentialSubject.id)
  issuerPublicKey = retrieveIssuerPublicKey(didDocument)

  if not verifyVC(vc, issuerPublicKey):
    return false  // VC is invalid

  holderPublicKey = vc.credentialSubject.publicKey

  if not verifySignature(encryptedData.signature, holderPublicKey):
    return false // Data signature is invalid

  // Proceed with decryption using the verified public key
  return true
```

**5. Advantages:**

*   **Decentralized Trust:** Removes reliance on centralized authorities for key management and trust.
*   **Enhanced Auditability:** All credential issuance and verification events are recorded on a distributed ledger.
*   **Improved Privacy:** Holder controls their identity and shares only necessary information.
*   **Interoperability:** VCs are based on W3C standards, promoting interoperability between different systems.
*   **Scalability**: Decentralized Identity is designed to be highly scalable and adaptable.
