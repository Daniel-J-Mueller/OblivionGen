## Dynamic Data Sharding based on Write Amplification Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the entropy-aware symbol mapping to proactively shard data *across* different physical memory locations (e.g., different flash chips in an SSD) based on predicted write amplification. The goal is to distribute write load, lessening wear on any single memory location, beyond the scope of a single table.

**Specs:**

**1. Write Amplification Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Database operation logs (writes, updates, deletes), table metadata (column types, size), data characteristics (entropy of data within columns â€“ leverage existing entropy calculations).
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze write patterns for each column/field over a rolling window (e.g., last hour, last day).
    *   Model predicted write amplification for each column/field based on write frequency, data entropy, and data type. High entropy + high write frequency = high predicted write amplification. Consider leveraging a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future write amplification.
    *   Assign a "Wear Score" to each column/field based on the predicted write amplification.
*   **Output:** Wear Score for each column/field.

**2. Dynamic Sharding Manager:**

*   **Input:** Wear Scores from the Write Amplification Prediction Module, physical memory map (available space on each memory chip/region), database schema.
*   **Process:**
    *   Periodically (e.g., every few minutes, or triggered by significant changes in Wear Scores) re-evaluate data sharding.
    *   Prioritize sharding columns/fields with high Wear Scores onto different physical memory locations.
    *   Implement a sharding strategy:
        *   **Column-level sharding:**  Store different columns of a table on different memory locations.
        *   **Row-level sharding (with affinity):** Distribute rows across memory locations, but maintain affinity for related data (e.g., related rows remain on the same chip/region).
    *   Consider data locality: Minimize cross-chip/region access for common queries.
*   **Output:** Updated sharding map.

**3. Storage Engine Integration:**

*   **Intercept write operations:** Before writing data to memory, consult the sharding map.
*   **Route data:**  Direct each piece of data (column, field) to the appropriate memory location based on the sharding map.
*   **Manage read operations:**  When reading data, retrieve data from multiple memory locations as needed. Cache frequently accessed data for performance.

**Pseudocode (Sharding Manager):**

```
function RebalanceSharding(schema, wearScores, memoryMap):
  shardingMap = {}
  
  // Sort columns by Wear Score (descending)
  sortedColumns = sort(schema.columns, key=lambda col: wearScores[col.name])
  
  for column in sortedColumns:
    // Find least loaded memory location
    targetLocation = findLeastLoaded(memoryMap)
    
    // Assign column to target location
    shardingMap[column.name] = targetLocation
    
    // Update memoryMap (mark location as used)
    memoryMap[targetLocation].usedSpace += column.size
  
  return shardingMap
```

**Considerations:**

*   **Data Consistency:** Implement mechanisms to ensure data consistency across multiple memory locations (e.g., distributed transactions, replication).
*   **Performance Overhead:** Minimize the performance overhead of sharding and data retrieval.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to scale to handle large datasets and high write loads.
*   **Dynamic Rebalancing:** Continuously monitor wear levels and dynamically rebalance data as needed.
