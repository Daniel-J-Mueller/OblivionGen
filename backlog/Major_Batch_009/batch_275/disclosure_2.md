## Context-Aware Haptic Feedback System for Multi-Device Interaction

**System Overview:**

This design details a system that extends the concept of device arbitration by adding a layer of haptic feedback directed *towards the user* to reinforce the selected device and provide intuitive confirmation of command execution.  It acknowledges that arbitration isn't just about *which* device responds, but about *how* the user perceives that response.

**Core Components:**

*   **Wearable Haptic Array:** A wrist-worn or potentially full-arm band equipped with an array of micro-actuators capable of generating localized tactile sensations. The array density should be sufficient to represent directional cues.
*   **Proximity/Directional Sensors:** Embedded within the wearable device, these sensors detect the user’s gaze direction and hand/body orientation relative to nearby devices.  Could employ miniature cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic emitters.
*   **Device Mapping Database:** A local database storing the spatial arrangement of devices within the typical user environment (e.g., living room, office). Updated via initial calibration and potentially ongoing sensor data.
*   **Arbitration Engine Integration:**  The system integrates with the existing device arbitration engine (from the provided patent) to receive information about the selected device *before* the command is sent.
*   **Haptic Feedback Generator:**  Software component translating the selected device information into specific haptic patterns.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Speech Input & Arbitration:** The user issues a voice command. The device arbitration engine determines the appropriate device to respond.
2.  **Device Location Retrieval:** The system queries the Device Mapping Database to determine the physical location of the selected device relative to the user.
3.  **Haptic Pattern Generation:** The Haptic Feedback Generator creates a haptic pattern based on the device’s location. This pattern consists of:
    *   **Directional Cue:** Activates actuators on the wearable array corresponding to the device’s direction from the user.  Higher intensity represents closer proximity.
    *   **Confirmation Pulse:** A short, distinct vibration confirming the command is being processed *by* the selected device.
    *   **Operation Feedback:**  Varying vibration patterns/intensities indicating the *type* of operation being performed (e.g., a continuous vibration for volume up, a staccato burst for channel change).
4.  **Haptic Output:** The generated haptic pattern is transmitted to the wearable array, providing the user with tactile feedback.
5.  **Ongoing Feedback (Optional):** As the selected device executes the command (e.g., music plays, TV displays content), subtle haptic vibrations can continue to reinforce the interaction.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Pattern Generation):**

```pseudocode
function generateHapticPattern(selectedDeviceId, commandType):
    deviceLocation = getDeviceLocation(selectedDeviceId)
    directionAngle = calculateAngleToDevice(deviceLocation, userOrientation)

    // Map angle to actuator array indices
    actuatorIndices = mapAngleToActuators(directionAngle)

    // Intensity based on distance
    distance = calculateDistance(deviceLocation, userLocation)
    intensity = 100 - (distance * scalingFactor) //Normalize distance to intensity

    // Command-Specific Pattern
    if commandType == "VOLUME_UP":
        pattern = continuousVibration(intensity)
    elif commandType == "CHANNEL_CHANGE":
        pattern = staccatoBurst(intensity)
    else:
        pattern = shortPulse(intensity)

    // Apply pattern to actuators
    for index in actuatorIndices:
        activateActuator(index, pattern)
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Gesture Integration:**  Combine haptic feedback with gesture recognition.  A user could point at a device to explicitly select it before issuing a command.
*   **Personalized Profiles:** Allow users to customize haptic patterns and intensity levels.
*   **Ambient Awareness:** Integrate data from other sensors (e.g., room lighting, temperature) to further refine the haptic experience.
*   **Multi-User Support:**  Distinguish between users and tailor haptic feedback accordingly.
*   **Integration with AR/VR environments:** Layer haptic feedback onto virtual device representations.
