## Dynamic UI Control Grouping & Predictive Action Sequencing

**Concept:** Extend the adaptive action system to dynamically group UI controls based on user behavior and predictively sequence actions *across* multiple controls, minimizing user interaction for complex tasks.

**Specs:**

*   **UI Control Grouping Module:**
    *   **Input:** User interaction data (taps, swipes, dwell time) across all visible UI controls. Control metadata (associated action, parameters, price info).
    *   **Process:**  Employ a clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, K-Means) to identify frequently co-activated UI controls. Define a ‘cohesion score’ based on the frequency and temporal proximity of activations.
    *   **Output:** Dynamic UI control groups. Each group represents a logical unit of interaction (e.g., “Order Confirmation”, “Shipping Options”, "Related Items"). Visually indicated by subtle highlighting or grouping on the display.
*   **Predictive Action Sequencing Engine:**
    *   **Input:** User’s current task context (derived from app state and recent interactions). Historical user behavior data (aggregated and anonymized).  UI control group definitions.
    *   **Process:**  A probabilistic model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model, Recurrent Neural Network) predicts the *next* most likely UI control activation *within* the current control group. Consider factors like sequence length, transition probabilities, and task completion rates.
    *   **Output:**  Predicted next action. Confidence score for the prediction.
*   **Automated Action Execution:**
    *   If the confidence score exceeds a predefined threshold, the predicted action is automatically executed *without* requiring explicit user interaction. Provide visual feedback to the user (e.g., a brief animation) confirming the automated action.
    *   Implement a “veto” mechanism allowing the user to quickly cancel an automated action before it is fully executed.
*   **Adaptive Thresholding:**
    *   The confidence score threshold for automated action execution is dynamically adjusted based on the user’s interaction patterns. Users who frequently override automated actions will have a higher threshold.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   All user behavior data used for predictive modeling is anonymized and aggregated. Users have the option to opt out of data collection.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Action Sequencing Engine):**

```
FUNCTION predictNextAction(currentUser, currentTaskContext, currentControlGroup):
    // Load user's historical interaction data
    userHistory = LOAD_USER_HISTORY(currentUser)

    // Load task-specific interaction data
    taskHistory = LOAD_TASK_HISTORY(currentTaskContext)

    // Combine data sources
    combinedData = MERGE_DATA(userHistory, taskHistory)

    // Train probabilistic model
    model = TRAIN_MODEL(combinedData)

    // Get current control group state
    currentState = GET_CURRENT_STATE(currentControlGroup)

    // Predict next state
    predictedState = PREDICT_NEXT_STATE(model, currentState)

    // Get predicted action
    predictedAction = GET_ACTION_FROM_STATE(predictedState)

    // Calculate confidence score
    confidenceScore = CALCULATE_CONFIDENCE_SCORE(model, predictedState)

    RETURN predictedAction, confidenceScore
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **E-commerce:** Automatically adding a frequently purchased item to the cart after browsing a related product.
*   **Media Streaming:** Automatically starting the next episode of a series after the current one finishes.
*   **Smart Home Control:** Automatically adjusting the thermostat based on the user's location and time of day.
*   **Gaming:** Automatically performing a common action sequence during gameplay.
