## Acoustic Resonance Mapping for Internal Defect Detection

**Concept:** Adapt the principles of vibrometric analysis to create a non-destructive testing (NDT) method for detecting internal defects within complex structures, specifically targeting aerospace components. Instead of solely observing external vibration modes, this system focuses on mapping acoustic resonance *within* the material itself, revealing voids, cracks, or delamination invisible to traditional methods.

**Specifications:**

*   **Excitation Source:** Phased array of ultrasonic transducers capable of generating complex wave patterns across a broad frequency spectrum (10 kHz – 5 MHz). These will be embedded within a flexible 'skin' conforming to the target structure's geometry.
*   **Sensor Array:** High-resolution digital micro-mirror device (DMD) coupled with a hyperspectral camera. The DMD projects structured light onto the target surface, and the hyperspectral camera captures subtle deformations indicative of internal resonances. (Resolution < 10 microns).
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance GPU cluster for real-time signal processing and image reconstruction.  Algorithms to incorporate both amplitude *and phase* information from the hyperspectral data.
*   **Software Stack:**
    *   **Resonance Mapping Algorithm:**
        1.  Sweep excitation frequencies across the specified range.
        2.  For each frequency:
            *   Project a known light pattern using the DMD.
            *   Capture a hyperspectral image.
            *   Calculate the displacement field using digital image correlation (DIC).
            *   Perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the displacement field to identify resonant frequencies.
            *   Create a ‘resonance map’ visualizing the spatial distribution of resonant frequencies.
        3.  Machine learning module to classify resonance signatures corresponding to different defect types (voids, cracks, delamination).
    *   **3D Reconstruction Module:** Integrate resonance map data with 3D CAD models of the structure to pinpoint defect locations and sizes.
    *   **User Interface:** Intuitive visual display of 3D defect maps with adjustable parameters for frequency range, sensitivity, and defect classification.

*   **System Calibration:** Automated calibration procedure using a known defect standard to ensure accurate resonance mapping.

*   **Materials:**
    *   Flexible transducer array substrate: Silicone or polyurethane.
    *   Transducer elements: Piezoelectric ceramics (PZT).
    *   Hyperspectral camera: Visible and near-infrared (VNIR) range.

**Pseudocode - Resonance Mapping Algorithm:**

```
FUNCTION MapResonances(StructureCADModel, FrequencyRange, Resolution)

  Initialize TransducerArray
  Initialize HyperspectralCamera
  Initialize ResonanceMap

  FOR Frequency IN FrequencyRange:
    ProjectStructuredLight(Frequency)
    CaptureImage()
    DisplacementField = CalculateDisplacementField()
    FrequencyDomain = FFT(DisplacementField)
    ResonantFrequencies = IdentifyResonantFrequencies(FrequencyDomain)
    UpdateResonanceMap(ResonantFrequencies)
  END FOR

  ClassifyDefects(ResonanceMap)
  Return ResonanceMap
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**  Existing vibrometric methods primarily analyze surface vibrations. This system aims to detect resonances *within* materials, enabling detection of subsurface defects inaccessible to conventional methods.  The combination of structured light projection and hyperspectral imaging with advanced signal processing provides a high-resolution, non-destructive testing solution for complex structures.
