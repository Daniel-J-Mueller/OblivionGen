## Haptic Audio Projection System

**Concept:** A system utilizing focused ultrasound arrays to create localized haptic feedback synced with audio playback, effectively "projecting" the feeling of sound directly onto the user. This builds upon the patent’s concurrent audio/ultrasound transmission but fundamentally shifts the *purpose* – from simply transmitting both signals to creating a localized, tactile experience.

**I. System Specifications:**

*   **Core Components:**
    *   **Multi-Element Ultrasound Array:** A phased array of miniature ultrasonic transducers (minimum 64 elements, optimally 256+).  Each element must be individually addressable with precise timing control. Frequency range: 20kHz - 80kHz (tunable).
    *   **Audio Processing Unit:** A high-fidelity audio processor capable of real-time spectral analysis and mapping of audio frequencies to ultrasound modulation patterns.
    *   **Spatial Mapping System:**  A system (camera-based or sensor-based) to determine user position and orientation relative to the ultrasound array.  Minimum accuracy: 5cm.
    *   **Control Unit:** A microcontroller or dedicated processor to manage signal processing, spatial mapping, and array element control.
    *   **Power Amplifier:**  High-efficiency power amplifier to drive the ultrasound transducers.
    *   **Enclosure:**  A structurally sound enclosure to house the array and associated electronics, designed to minimize acoustic reflections.

*   **Array Configuration:**
    *   **Physical Arrangement:**  Planar array preferred, but flexible arrangements (curved, spherical) are possible.  Element spacing: 2-5mm.
    *   **Beamforming:**  Digital beamforming techniques to focus ultrasound energy at a specific point in space.  Adjustable focal length (5cm - 2m).
    *   **Steering:**  Electronic steering of the ultrasound beam to track user movements.

*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Audio Analysis Module:** Real-time spectral analysis of audio signals (FFT, wavelet transforms). Identify dominant frequencies and transients.
    *   **Haptic Mapping Algorithm:** Maps audio frequencies and amplitudes to ultrasound modulation parameters (frequency, amplitude, pulse width).
        *   Low Frequencies (20Hz – 200Hz):  Modulate ultrasound amplitude to create broad, subtle vibrations.
        *   Mid Frequencies (200Hz – 2kHz):  Modulate ultrasound frequency for sharper, localized sensations.
        *   High Frequencies (2kHz – 20kHz): Create a tingling sensation by precisely controlling pulse width of the ultrasound waves.
    *   **Spatial Tracking & Beamforming Control:**  Integrates data from the spatial tracking system to dynamically adjust the ultrasound beam's position and focus.
    *   **Safety Limiter:**  A software-based safety limiter to ensure ultrasound intensity remains within safe exposure limits (IEC 62366-1).

**II. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initialization:** Spatial tracking system calibrates and determines initial user position.
2.  **Audio Input:** Audio signal is fed into the audio processing unit.
3.  **Analysis & Mapping:** The audio analysis module analyzes the signal and the haptic mapping algorithm generates corresponding ultrasound modulation parameters.
4.  **Beamforming & Control:** The control unit drives the ultrasound array elements to generate a focused ultrasound beam with the specified modulation.
5.  **Spatial Tracking & Adjustment:** The spatial tracking system continuously monitors user position and adjusts the beam's direction and focus to maintain accurate tactile stimulation.
6.  **Safety Monitoring:** The safety limiter continuously monitors ultrasound intensity and adjusts parameters as needed to prevent overexposure.

**III. Pseudocode (Haptic Mapping Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION MapAudioToHaptics (audio_signal, user_position):
  spectrum = FFT(audio_signal)
  
  FOR frequency, amplitude IN spectrum:
    IF frequency < 200 Hz:
      ultrasound_amplitude = amplitude * 0.5  //Scale amplitude for lower frequencies
      ultrasound_frequency = 40kHz // Base Frequency
    ELSE IF frequency < 2kHz:
      ultrasound_frequency = 40kHz + (frequency / 10) // Modulate freq for mids
      ultrasound_amplitude = amplitude * 0.2
    ELSE:
      ultrasound_amplitude = amplitude * 0.1
      ultrasound_frequency = 40kHz //high frequency base
      
    beam_position = CalculateBeamPosition(user_position, frequency) //Determine target location
    SetBeamParameters(beam_position, ultrasound_frequency, ultrasound_amplitude)
  END FOR

  RETURN

**IV. Potential Applications:**

*   **Immersive Gaming:** Provide tactile feedback for in-game events (explosions, impacts, wind).
*   **Accessibility:** Create tactile representations of audio content for visually impaired individuals.
*   **Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality:** Enhance VR/AR experiences with realistic tactile sensations.
*   **Medical Applications:** Targeted drug delivery, non-invasive therapy.
*   **Entertainment:** Create unique and engaging sensory experiences.
