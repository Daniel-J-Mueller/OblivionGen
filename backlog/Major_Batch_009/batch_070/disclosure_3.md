## Adaptive Model Lineage & Drift Compensation

**Concept:** Extend the aggregated model training framework to track not just error rates, but *lineage* – the specific training data subsets and algorithm versions used for each constituent model.  Introduce a drift compensation mechanism that proactively re-weights or retrains models based on detected deviations in input data characteristics *before* performance degradation occurs.

**Specifications:**

**1. Lineage Tracking Module:**

*   **Data:** For each trained model (first, second, aggregated, etc.), store:
    *   Algorithm Version (e.g., v1.2.3 of a specific neural network architecture).
    *   Training Data Subset ID (unique identifier for the portion of user data used).
    *   Hyperparameter Configuration (all parameters used during training).
    *   Training Timestamp.
    *   Evaluation Metrics (error rate, precision, recall, etc. on hold-out data).
*   **Implementation:**  Utilize a graph database to represent model lineage.  Each model is a node, and edges represent dependencies (e.g., model A was combined with model B to create model C).
*   **API:**
    *   `record_model_lineage(model_id, algorithm_version, data_subset_id, hyperparameters, metrics)`
    *   `get_model_lineage(model_id)`
    *   `query_lineage(algorithm_version, data_subset_id)` – returns a list of models trained with specific configuration.

**2. Drift Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time incoming inference requests (user data).
*   **Method:** Employ a statistical drift detection algorithm (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Population Stability Index) to compare the distribution of features in the incoming data to the distribution of features in the original training data subsets (stored during lineage tracking).
*   **Output:** Drift Score (a numerical value indicating the degree of deviation) for each training data subset.

**3. Adaptive Re-weighting/Retraining Module:**

*   **Input:** Drift Scores, Model Lineage, Current Model Weights.
*   **Logic:**
    *   If Drift Score for a specific training data subset exceeds a threshold:
        *   **Option 1: Dynamic Re-weighting:** Reduce the weight of models trained on that dataset in the aggregated model. The reduction is proportional to the Drift Score.
        *   **Option 2: Incremental Retraining:** Trigger incremental retraining of the affected models using the most recent incoming data (consider using a 'replay buffer' of recent requests).
    *   Periodically (e.g., daily), re-evaluate all models on a hold-out dataset and adjust weights accordingly, even if no drift is detected.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function adjust_model_weights(drift_scores, model_lineage, current_weights, threshold):
    new_weights = current_weights
    for model_id, lineage_data in model_lineage:
        data_subset_id = lineage_data.data_subset_id
        drift_score = drift_scores[data_subset_id]
        if drift_score > threshold:
            weight_reduction = drift_score / threshold  # Scale reduction based on score
            new_weights[model_id] = new_weights[model_id] * (1 - weight_reduction)
            # Optionally trigger incremental retraining here
    return new_weights
```

**4.  Multi-Level Aggregation:**

*   Expand beyond simple weighted averaging of two models.  Allow for hierarchical aggregation.  E.g., train multiple aggregated models from different combinations of base models.  The drift detection and re-weighting modules can then select the *best performing aggregated model* based on real-time data.

**Data Storage Requirements:**

*   Graph database (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) to store model lineage.
*   Storage for training data subsets and historical feature distributions.
*   Replay buffer for recent inference requests.
