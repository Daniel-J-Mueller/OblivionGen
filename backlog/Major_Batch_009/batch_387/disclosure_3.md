## Dynamic Metadata Weighting for Flow Prioritization

**Concept:** Extend the metadata collection to incorporate real-time performance metrics for network flows, and dynamically weight metadata entries based on these metrics to prioritize traffic rewriting. This allows the system to not just *know* about flows, but to *react* to their current behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Metadata Extension:**

*   Add fields to existing metadata summaries (local decisions, flow state) for:
    *   `Latency_ms`: Recent average latency experienced by the flow (measured in milliseconds).
    *   `Packet_Loss_Percent`: Recent percentage of packets lost for the flow.
    *   `Bandwidth_Kbps`: Current bandwidth utilization of the flow.
    *   `Priority_Score`: A calculated score based on latency, loss, and bandwidth (see Calculation below).

**2. Priority Score Calculation:**

*   The `Priority_Score` is calculated using a weighted formula.  Weights are configurable via system administration.

```
Priority_Score = (Weight_Latency * (1 / Latency_ms)) + (Weight_Loss * (1 - (Packet_Loss_Percent / 100))) + (Weight_Bandwidth * (Bandwidth_Kbps / Max_Bandwidth))
```

    *   `Weight_Latency`, `Weight_Loss`, `Weight_Bandwidth` are configurable weights (summing to 1).
    *   `Max_Bandwidth` is a system-defined maximum bandwidth value.  The division normalizes the bandwidth value.
    *   The `1 / Latency_ms` provides higher scores for lower latency.
    *   The `(1 - (Packet_Loss_Percent / 100))` gives higher scores for lower packet loss.

**3. Dynamic Weighting Algorithm:**

*   During metadata update iterations, the system calculates a ‘relevance score’ for each metadata entry based on its associated `Priority_Score`.
*   The relevance score is used to dynamically adjust the influence of that metadata entry on rewrite decision calculations.

```pseudocode
function calculate_rewrite_entry(metadata_collection):
  weighted_sum = 0
  total_weight = 0

  for entry in metadata_collection:
    weight = entry.relevance_score
    weighted_sum += entry.value * weight
    total_weight += weight

  if total_weight > 0:
    rewrite_value = weighted_sum / total_weight
  else:
    rewrite_value = default_rewrite_value # fallback if all weights are zero

  return rewrite_value
```

**4.  Data Collection & Monitoring:**

*   Integrate with network monitoring tools (e.g., NetFlow, sFlow, telemetry) to collect real-time performance metrics for each flow.
*   Implement a monitoring dashboard to visualize flow performance and adjust weight parameters.
*   Consider using a time-decay function to give more weight to recent data when calculating performance metrics.

**5. Implementation Details**

*   Metadata collection will need to be thread-safe to support concurrent access.
*   Weight parameter configuration must be accessible via a system administration interface.
*   The system should log performance data to facilitate analysis and troubleshooting.
*   A watchdog process should monitor data collection and alert administrators if data is stale or missing.
