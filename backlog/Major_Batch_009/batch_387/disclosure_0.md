## Adaptive Trust Beaconing

**Concept:** Expand the trust model beyond paired devices to incorporate localized, ephemeral trust beacons. These beacons, emitted by trusted mobile devices, dynamically adjust the trust level granted to nearby, less-trusted devices. Think of it like a localized ‘reputation’ system for device authentication.

**Specs:**

*   **Beacon Type:** Short-range, low-power broadcast signal (Bluetooth Low Energy, Ultra-Wideband). The beacon payload includes:
    *   User Account Identifier (encrypted)
    *   Trust Level (numerical value, e.g., 1-10) – reflecting user-defined settings & historical device interactions.
    *   Timestamp & validity duration.
    *   Digital signature (user-private key).
*   **Device Roles:**
    *   *Trust Anchor:* User's mobile device (smartphone, smartwatch) – source of the Trust Beacon.
    *   *Requesting Device:* The device needing authentication (smart TV, set-top box, POS terminal).
    *   *Gateway:* (Optional) A central hub, if network connectivity is required for validation.
*   **Authentication Flow:**
    1.  Requesting Device initiates authentication request.
    2.  Requesting Device scans for Trust Beacons.
    3.  If Beacons are detected:
        *   Requesting Device collects Beacon data (Trust Level, User ID).
        *   Requesting Device validates the Beacon’s signature.
        *   Requesting Device transmits the validated Beacon data to the Network Server (or Gateway).
    4.  Network Server (or Gateway) verifies the User ID against its database.
    5.  Network Server (or Gateway) uses the received Trust Level, potentially combining it with its own device reputation score, to determine access permissions.
    6.  Access is granted (or denied) based on the combined trust score.
*   **Dynamic Trust Adjustment:**
    *   Trust Level is user-configurable. Users can increase or decrease the Trust Level emitted for specific scenarios (e.g., home network vs. public Wi-Fi).
    *   Trust Level can be time-decayed. A high Trust Level is temporarily granted, but reduces over time if no further interaction occurs.
    *   Trust Level can be influenced by user behavior. Frequent, successful interactions increase Trust Level, while failed interactions decrease it.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   Beacon payloads must be encrypted to prevent eavesdropping and spoofing.
    *   Digital signatures are essential to verify the authenticity of the Beacon source.
    *   Regular key rotation is crucial to mitigate the risk of compromised keys.
    *   Protection against relay attacks (where a malicious actor intercepts and retransmits Beacons) is needed.

**Pseudocode (Requesting Device):**

```
function authenticate():
    scanForBeacons()
    if beaconsFound:
        for beacon in beacons:
            if verifySignature(beacon.signature):
                userId = decrypt(beacon.userId)
                trustLevel = beacon.trustLevel
                sendToNetworkServer(userId, trustLevel)
                //Await response from network server
                if response.status == "authorized":
                    grantAccess()
                    return
    //If no beacons or authorization failed
    requestTraditionalAuthentication()
```

**Possible Extensions:**

*   **Proximity-Based Trust:** Vary the Trust Level based on the distance from the Trust Anchor (closer = higher trust).
*   **Contextual Trust:** Adjust Trust Level based on the surrounding environment (e.g., trusted network vs. public Wi-Fi).
*   **Behavioral Biometrics:** Incorporate behavioral data (e.g., typing speed, gait analysis) into the Trust Level calculation.
