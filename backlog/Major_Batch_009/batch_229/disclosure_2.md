## Adaptive Proof-of-Work Difficulty Based on Client Reputation

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the computational difficulty of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) task not just on a global basis, but *per-client*, factoring in a “reputation score” derived from historical interactions. This aims to reduce resource waste from consistently high difficulty for trusted clients, while simultaneously increasing resistance to botnets and denial-of-service attacks.

**Specs:**

*   **Reputation System:**
    *   Each client device is assigned a reputation score, initialized at a baseline value (e.g., 50).
    *   Successful SPA requests *increase* the reputation score (e.g., +1 per successful request, capped at 100).
    *   Failed SPA requests (due to PoW failure *or* authentication failure) *decrease* the reputation score (e.g., -2 for PoW failure, -5 for authentication failure).
    *   Reputation score is stored server-side, associated with a persistent client identifier (e.g., hardware ID, browser fingerprint, account ID – using a privacy-respecting approach).
    *   Scores decay over time (e.g., lose 1 point per day if inactive) to account for potential compromised devices or changes in user behavior.
*   **Adaptive Difficulty:**
    *   The PoW difficulty is *not* fixed. Instead, it is calculated based on the client’s reputation score.
    *   Difficulty levels:
        *   **Low (Reputation 80-100):** Minimal PoW requirement –  a simple hash calculation or short-duration computation.
        *   **Medium (Reputation 50-79):** Moderate PoW requirement – a more complex hash chain or longer computation.
        *   **High (Reputation 0-49):** Significant PoW requirement – a computationally expensive task like a multi-round hash chain or a constrained cryptographic puzzle.
    *   The access control service dynamically adjusts the PoW task parameters (e.g., number of leading zeros required in a hash, complexity of the cryptographic puzzle) based on the calculated difficulty level.
*   **PoW Task Variety:**
    *   Implement a pool of different PoW tasks (e.g., hashing, prime factorization, solving a constraint satisfaction problem).
    *   The access control service randomly selects a PoW task from the pool for each client request, adding an additional layer of complexity for attackers.
*   **Client-Side Implementation:**
    *   The client device receives the PoW task parameters (task type, difficulty level) from the access control service.
    *   The client performs the PoW task and submits the result (output of the task) along with the SPA request.
*   **Server-Side Validation:**
    *   The access control service validates the PoW result against the expected parameters and difficulty level.
    *   If the validation succeeds, the reputation score is updated accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function handleSPARequest(clientIdentifier, spaCredential, powOutput):
  clientReputation = getClientReputation(clientIdentifier)
  difficultyLevel = calculateDifficultyLevel(clientReputation)
  powTask = selectPowTask(difficultyLevel)
  if verifyPowOutput(powOutput, powTask):
    if authenticate(spaCredential):
      allowAccess()
      updateClientReputation(clientIdentifier, +1) //Reward successful request
    else:
      updateClientReputation(clientIdentifier, -5) //Penalize authentication failure
  else:
    updateClientReputation(clientIdentifier, -2) //Penalize PoW failure

function calculateDifficultyLevel(reputation):
  if reputation >= 80:
    return "Low"
  elif reputation >= 50:
    return "Medium"
  else:
    return "High"
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Resource Waste:** Trusted clients perform minimal PoW, saving energy and resources.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Untrusted or malicious clients face a significantly higher PoW barrier.
*   **Dynamic Adaptability:**  The system learns from client behavior and adjusts accordingly.
*   **Botnet Mitigation:**  Difficulties scale up significantly making botnets ineffective.
