## Dynamic Trust Scoring with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the existing secure communication framework by integrating continuous, dynamic trust scoring based on behavioral biometrics alongside the static secret information. This moves beyond verifying *who* the client is, to verifying *how* the client is behaving.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection Module (BDCM):**

*   **Data Points:**  Collect keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure, patterns), mouse movement (speed, acceleration, path complexity), scrolling behavior, and network traffic patterns (timing, packet size variations) during sign-on and subsequent interactions.
*   **Implementation:**  Javascript embedded within the client site (or a browser extension) for local data collection.  Data transmitted to the sign-on service in an encrypted format.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  Data anonymization and aggregation techniques to minimize personally identifiable information.  User consent required for data collection.

**2. Trust Scoring Engine (TSE):**

*   **Model:** Machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM) trained on a large dataset of authenticated user behavior.
*   **Features:**  Derived features from the collected behavioral data (e.g., keystroke entropy, mouse movement smoothness, network jitter).
*   **Output:**  A dynamic trust score ranging from 0 to 100, representing the likelihood that the current session is legitimate.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The model continuously retrains itself based on new data and feedback.

**3. Enhanced Verification Protocol:**

*   **Initial Sign-On:**
    *   Standard secret-based verification.
    *   Establish a baseline behavioral profile for the user.
*   **Subsequent Interactions:**
    *   Calculate the current trust score.
    *   Combine the trust score with the secret-based verification.
    *   Implement tiered access control based on the combined score:
        *   **High Score (90-100):**  Transparent access.
        *   **Medium Score (70-89):**  Multi-factor authentication prompt (e.g., SMS code, authenticator app).
        *   **Low Score (0-69):**  Session termination or significantly restricted access.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Identify unusual behavior patterns that deviate significantly from the established baseline. Trigger alerts and/or initiate additional verification steps.

**4.  Communication Protocol Updates:**

*   **New Request Parameters:** Include the dynamic trust score and relevant behavioral data within the request sent to the sign-on service.
*   **Response Codes:**  Introduce new response codes to indicate the level of trust associated with the current session.
*   **Encryption:** Enhance encryption protocols to protect the sensitive behavioral data during transmission.

**Pseudocode (Sign-On Service):**

```
function verifyRequest(request):
  secretMatch = verifySecret(request.secret)
  behavioralData = request.behavioralData
  trustScore = calculateTrustScore(behavioralData)

  combinedScore = (secretMatchWeight * secretMatch) + (trustScoreWeight * trustScore)

  if combinedScore >= thresholdHigh:
    grantAccess()
  else if combinedScore >= thresholdMedium:
    promptMFA()
  else:
    terminateSession()
```

**Engineer Notes:**

*   The machine learning model requires a substantial dataset for training and continuous refinement.
*   Privacy concerns must be addressed through data anonymization and user consent mechanisms.
*   Performance optimization is critical to minimize the impact on user experience.
*   The system should be designed to be resilient to adversarial attacks (e.g., behavioral spoofing).
*   Consider using federated learning to train the model on decentralized data sources.
