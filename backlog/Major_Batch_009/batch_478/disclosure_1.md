## Dynamic Trust Scoring & Adaptive Key Derivation

**Concept:** Extend the existing dynamic key derivation to incorporate a trust scoring system, adapting key complexity and lifespan based on ongoing behavioral analysis of the requestor. This moves beyond simple authentication to a continuously assessed trust level, influencing cryptographic operations.

**Specifications:**

**1. Trust Score Calculation Module:**

*   **Input:** Request metadata (IP address, timestamp, request type, payload size), behavioral data (request frequency, successful operation rate, resource consumption, deviation from established patterns).
*   **Process:**
    *   Initial Trust Score: Assign a base score to new requestors.
    *   Real-time Analysis: Analyze each request against historical behavioral data.
    *   Weighted Factors: Assign weights to different behavioral factors (e.g., high successful operation rate = positive weight; unusual request frequency = negative weight).
    *   Score Update: Adjust the trust score based on the weighted factors. Utilize a decaying average to prevent rapid score fluctuations.
*   **Output:** A normalized trust score (0.0 - 1.0).

**2. Adaptive Key Derivation Module:**

*   **Input:** Trust score, shared cryptographic material, derivation parameters.
*   **Process:**
    *   Key Complexity Adjustment: Based on the trust score, dynamically adjust the complexity of the cryptographic key derivation function (e.g., number of hashing rounds, key length).  Higher trust = simpler derivation, lower trust = more complex derivation.
    *   Key Lifespan Adjustment:  Dynamically adjust the lifespan of the derived key. High trust = longer lifespan, low trust = shorter lifespan, requiring more frequent key rotation.
    *   Derivation Parameter Modification: Trust score influences the selection of derivation parameters. A trusted entity may receive parameters optimized for speed, while a less trusted entity may receive parameters prioritizing security.
*   **Output:** Derived cryptographic key.

**3. Signature Generation & Verification Updates:**

*   **Signature Generation:**  Integrate the adaptive key into the digital signature generation process. The signature algorithm utilizes the dynamically derived key.
*   **Verification:** Update verification process to support dynamically derived keys and associated key metadata (derivation parameters, key lifespan).

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Key Derivation):**

```
function deriveKey(sharedMaterial, derivationParams, trustScore):
  if trustScore >= 0.9:
    complexityLevel = "low"
    keyLifespan = 3600  // 1 hour
  else if trustScore >= 0.6:
    complexityLevel = "medium"
    keyLifespan = 600 // 10 minutes
  else:
    complexityLevel = "high"
    keyLifespan = 60 // 1 minute

  if complexityLevel == "low":
    derivedKey = hash(sharedMaterial + derivationParams) // Simple hash
  else if complexityLevel == "medium":
    derivedKey = hash(hash(sharedMaterial + derivationParams) + salt) // Hashing with salt
  else:
    derivedKey = complexHash(sharedMaterial, derivationParams, iterations=10000) // Complex iterative hashing

  return derivedKey, keyLifespan
```

**4. Trust Store & Monitoring:**

*   Maintain a trust store mapping requestors to their current trust scores and associated key metadata.
*   Implement a monitoring system to detect anomalous behavior and trigger trust score adjustments.
*   Integrate with threat intelligence feeds to identify malicious actors and proactively lower their trust scores.
