## Resource Prediction & Dynamic Test Case Generation - "Chameleon Testing"

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing resource prediction system to *dynamically generate* test cases based on predicted resource constraints, aiming for maximum test coverage within allocated budgets.  Instead of fixed test suites, the system creates a 'chameleon' test plan adapting to available resources.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Resource Allocation Module:**
    *   Input: Predicted resource costs (from existing patent system), budget constraints (user input), testing priorities (user/system defined - e.g., critical path, high-risk areas).
    *   Process:  Applies optimization algorithms (e.g., linear programming, genetic algorithms) to allocate resources to different test categories.
    *   Output:  Resource budget per test category (e.g., functional testing, performance testing, security testing).

2.  **Test Case Generation Engine:**
    *   Input: Resource budget per test category, system specifications (API definitions, UI models, data schemas), coverage criteria (e.g., statement coverage, branch coverage, path coverage).
    *   Process: Generates test cases *on-demand* within the resource constraints.
        *   **Prioritization Heuristic:** Test cases are ranked based on coverage contribution and estimated execution cost. (Higher coverage / lower cost = higher priority).
        *   **Generation Techniques:**
            *   **Boundary Value Analysis:** Automatic generation of test cases around input boundaries.
            *   **Equivalence Partitioning:** Automatic generation of test cases representing different input classes.
            *   **Random Testing:**  Generation of random test inputs with constraints.
            *   **Model-Based Testing:** Generate tests based on a system model (state machine, UML diagram).
    *   Output:  A prioritized list of test cases for each category, designed to maximize coverage within budget.

3.  **Dynamic Test Execution & Monitoring:**
    *   Process: Executes test cases from the prioritized list.
    *   Monitoring:  Tracks resource consumption (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, time).
    *   Adaptive Adjustment: If resource usage exceeds predicted levels:
        *   Reduce the number of test cases executed.
        *   Prioritize critical test cases.
        *   Terminate long-running tests.
        *   Reduce the complexity of generated tests (e.g., fewer data combinations).

4.  **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Collects data on actual resource consumption during testing.
    *   Feeds this data back into the resource prediction model to improve accuracy.
    *   Adjusts prioritization heuristics based on test results.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Module):**

```
function allocateResources(predictedCosts, budget, priorities):
  // weights for each test category
  weights = {
    "functional": 0.4,
    "performance": 0.3,
    "security": 0.3
  }

  // Calculate total predicted cost
  totalCost = sum(predictedCosts.values())

  // Calculate resource allocation for each category
  allocations = {}
  for category, cost in predictedCosts.items():
    allocations[category] = (cost / totalCost) * budget * weights[category]

  return allocations
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `predictedCosts`: Dictionary {category: cost}
*   `allocations`: Dictionary {category: budget}
*   `TestCase`: Object {id, category, priority, input, expectedOutput, executionCost}

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond static resource prediction to *proactive* resource management during testing. It allows for dynamic adaptation to changing resource availability, maximizing test coverage within given constraints. It effectively turns testing into a real-time optimization problem.
