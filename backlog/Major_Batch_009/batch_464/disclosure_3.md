## Dynamic Resolution Window Previews with Predictive Scaling

**Concept:** Extend the window preview functionality by dynamically adjusting the resolution of the preview image *before* transmission to the client, based on both network conditions *and* predicted user interaction with the streamed window. This goes beyond simply ensuring bandwidth for transmission – it proactively prepares the preview for *how* the user is likely to engage with the full window.

**Specs:**

*   **Preview Resolution Profiles:** Define a set of pre-defined resolution/quality profiles (e.g., 'Low-Res Thumbnail', 'Medium-Res Hover Preview', 'High-Res Detailed Preview'). Each profile includes target resolution, compression settings, and a 'responsiveness' metric (delay acceptable for rendering).
*   **Network Condition Monitoring:** Continuously monitor network bandwidth, latency, and packet loss between the streaming server and client.
*   **Interaction Prediction Engine:**  Develop an engine (potentially AI-driven) that predicts user interaction. Factors:
    *   **Application Type:**  (e.g., Video Editor, Text Document, Web Browser). Different apps imply different interaction patterns.
    *   **Window History:**  How has the user interacted with this specific window in the past? (e.g., Frequent zooming, panning, content scrolling).
    *   **System Resource Usage:** What resources is the server currently allocating to this streamed application? (High CPU/GPU usage suggests limited ability to render a detailed preview rapidly).
    *   **Mouse/Touch Tracking:** (Client-side) - Monitor mouse movements *around* the window preview.  Rapid, precise movements suggest the user is preparing to interact actively.  Slow, hovering movements suggest passive viewing.
*   **Dynamic Preview Generation:**
    1.  Based on the Interaction Prediction Engine’s output and Network Condition Monitoring: Select an appropriate Resolution Profile.
    2.  Render the preview image *at* the selected resolution.
    3.  Compress the image using the profile’s compression settings.
    4.  Transmit the image to the client.
*   **Client-Side Preview Handling:**
    1.  Receive the preview image.
    2.  Display the image at its native resolution.
    3.  Potentially scale the image smoothly if a higher-resolution version becomes available (in response to improved network conditions or a more active predicted interaction).
*   **Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function generate_preview(window_id)
    network_data = get_network_conditions()
    interaction_prediction = predict_user_interaction(window_id)

    resolution_profile = select_resolution_profile(network_data, interaction_prediction)

    preview_image = render_window_preview(window_id, resolution_profile)

    compressed_image = compress_image(preview_image, resolution_profile)

    send_image_to_client(compressed_image)
end function
```

**Refinement & Potential:**

*   **AI-Driven Interaction Prediction:**  Use machine learning to train a model on user interaction data to improve the accuracy of the prediction engine.
*   **Content-Aware Scaling:** Adapt the scaling algorithm to prioritize areas of the window that are likely to be of interest to the user (e.g., text in a document, active video frame).
*   **Progressive Preview Rendering:**  Start with a very low-resolution preview and progressively increase the resolution as network conditions improve or user interaction becomes more active.
*   **Integration with Multi-Monitor Setups:**  Adjust the preview size and position based on the number and arrangement of monitors on the client device.
