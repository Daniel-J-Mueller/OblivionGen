## Adaptive Application Persona Generation

**Concept:** Extend the state persistence idea to create and maintain *multiple* application personas for a user, dynamically switching between them based on context (time of day, network location, detected task). Instead of simply restoring a single saved state, the system learns and profiles user behavior to *predict* desired application states.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Profiler Module:**

*   **Input:** Application usage data (keystrokes, mouse movements, open files, UI element interactions), system context (time, location, network, running processes).
*   **Process:**
    *   Time-series analysis of user input to identify recurring patterns.
    *   Machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) trained to predict application state based on context and past behavior.
    *   Creation of application "personas" - snapshots of application state associated with specific contexts.  Each persona includes application settings, open files, UI layout, and even predicted next actions.
    *   Automatic persona generation and refinement based on user interaction.
*   **Output:**  Persona profiles stored as JSON objects. Example:

```json
{
  "persona_id": "work_morning_001",
  "context": {
    "time_of_day": "08:00-10:00",
    "location": "office",
    "network": "company_wifi"
  },
  "application_state": {
    "application_id": "spreadsheet_app",
    "open_files": ["monthly_report.xlsx", "project_budget.xlsx"],
    "UI_layout": ["tab_1_visible", "column_3_frozen"],
    "settings": {
      "autosave_interval": 60,
      "theme": "dark"
    },
    "predicted_next_action": "input_sales_data"
  }
}
```

**2. Context Awareness Module:**

*   **Input:** System context (time, location, network), user activity (current application, open files).
*   **Process:**
    *   Real-time context monitoring.
    *   Matching current context to existing persona profiles.
    *   Selecting the most relevant persona.
    *   If no relevant persona is found, initiating a "learning phase" where the system observes user behavior and creates a new persona.
*   **Output:** Persona ID selected for activation.

**3. Application State Manager:**

*   **Input:** Persona ID, Application ID.
*   **Process:**
    *   Retrieves application state data from the selected persona.
    *   Applies the state data to the target application. This includes:
        *   Loading open files.
        *   Restoring UI layout.
        *   Setting application settings.
        *   Potentially pre-loading data or initiating automated tasks based on the "predicted_next_action".
*   **Output:**  Application restored to the desired state.

**4. API & Communication:**

*   Standardized API for communication between modules.
*   Message queue for asynchronous communication.
*   Secure data storage for persona profiles.

**Pseudocode (Context Awareness Module):**

```
function selectPersona(currentTime, currentLocation, currentNetwork, currentApp):
  relevantPersonas = []
  for persona in personaDatabase:
    if persona.context.time_of_day matches currentTime AND \
       persona.context.location matches currentLocation AND \
       persona.context.network matches currentNetwork:
      relevantPersonas.append(persona)

  if relevantPersonas is not empty:
    // Select the persona with the highest confidence score (based on matching criteria)
    selectedPersona = selectBestPersona(relevantPersonas)
    return selectedPersona.persona_id

  else:
    // Start learning phase - create a new persona based on current activity
    newPersona = createNewPersona(currentTime, currentLocation, currentNetwork, currentApp)
    savePersona(newPersona)
    return newPersona.persona_id
```

This system allows for a truly adaptive user experience, going beyond simply restoring a previous state to proactively predicting and preparing the application environment for the user's current needs. It's like having an assistant that anticipates your next move.
