## Dynamic Annotation 'Echoes' & Predictive Highlighting

**Concept:** Extend annotation transfer beyond simple position mapping to create 'echoes' of annotations across versions, incorporating predictive highlighting based on user reading patterns and version change deltas.

**Specs:**

**1. Echo Generation & Storage:**

*   **Data Structure:**  ‘Echo’ object. Fields:  `annotation_id`, `original_version`, `original_position`, `version_history` (array of `{version, position, confidence}`), `user_id`.
*   **Generation:** When an annotation is created/modified, an Echo object is generated.  `original_version` and `original_position` are recorded.
*   **Version Tracking:** When a user switches to a new version, the system attempts to map the annotation (using the existing position map tech).  A new `{version, position, confidence}` entry is added to `version_history`. Confidence is determined by the quality of the position map (metadata confidence factors, word match density).
*   **Storage:** Echo objects are stored in a graph database, linking annotations across versions.

**2. Predictive Highlighting:**

*   **Reading Pattern Analysis:** Monitor user reading speed, dwell time on sections, and annotation frequency.  Build a user profile.
*   **Delta Analysis:** When a user opens a new version, compare it to the last viewed version. Identify insertions, deletions, and modifications.
*   **Highlight Prediction:** Based on:
    *   User Profile (what sections do they typically annotate?).
    *   Delta Analysis (sections that have changed are likely to be relevant).
    *   Echo History (sections with annotations in prior versions are likely to be relevant).
*   **Highlighting Intensity:**  A ‘relevance score’ is calculated. This score determines the highlight color/intensity.  Higher score = more prominent highlight.

**3.  System Components:**

*   **Annotation Service:** Manages annotation creation, modification, and deletion.  Generates Echo objects.
*   **Version Service:** Tracks ebook versions. Provides version metadata.
*   **Position Map Service:** Provides position mapping functionality (as per existing patent).
*   **User Profile Service:** Stores user reading patterns and preferences.
*   **Highlight Prediction Engine:** Calculates relevance scores and generates highlights.
*   **Rendering Engine:** Applies highlights to the ebook text.

**Pseudocode (Highlight Prediction Engine):**

```pseudocode
function calculateRelevanceScore(user_id, version, position):
  user_profile = UserProfileService.getUserProfile(user_id)
  version_delta = VersionService.getDelta(version, user_profile.last_viewed_version)
  echo_history = EchoHistoryService.getEchoes(position)

  user_interest_score = user_profile.interest_in_topic(position)
  delta_score = VersionService.calculateDeltaRelevance(version_delta, position)
  echo_score = calculateEchoScore(echo_history)

  relevance_score = (user_interest_score * weight_user) + (delta_score * weight_delta) + (echo_score * weight_echo)
  return relevance_score

function calculateEchoScore(echo_history):
  total_confidence = 0
  for echo in echo_history:
    total_confidence += echo.confidence
  average_confidence = total_confidence / len(echo_history) if len(echo_history) > 0 else 0
  return average_confidence
```

**Novelty:** This expands the position mapping concept to create a *dynamic* annotation history that anticipates user interest across ebook versions, enhancing the reading experience and encouraging deeper engagement. It moves beyond simple annotation transfer to proactive information surfacing.
