## Dynamic Receiving Nest Arrays

**Concept:** Expand the receiving location manipulation beyond single-point adjustments. Introduce dynamically reconfigurable “nest” arrays composed of individually controlled, small receiving elements.

**Specs:**

*   **Receiving Element:** Each element is a small platform (e.g., 5cm x 5cm x 2cm) with 3 degrees of freedom – vertical translation (Z), pitch, and yaw – achieved through miniature linear actuators and gimbal mechanisms.  Material: High-density foam core with durable, replaceable surface layer (variable friction options).  Each element incorporates a force sensor to detect impact.
*   **Array Configuration:** Arrays are modular, composed of multiple (e.g., 10x10, scalable) receiving elements.  Elements connect via a power/data bus.
*   **Control System:** Centralized control module receives trajectory data from the tossing system. It calculates optimal element configuration *in real-time* based on item characteristics (mass, size, fragility) and trajectory.
*   **Algorithm - Dynamic Nest Formation:**
    1.  **Trajectory Prediction:** Receive predicted landing coordinates and velocity of the tossed item.
    2.  **Nest Footprint Calculation:** Determine the minimum area required to reliably catch the item, factoring in velocity and item dimensions.
    3.  **Element Activation:** Activate elements within the calculated footprint.  Deactivate elements outside the footprint.
    4.  **Surface Adjustment:**  Adjust the angle (pitch/yaw) of each activated element to create a concave surface, ‘funneling’ the item towards the center of the nest.  Adjust height (Z) to create a slight ‘bounce’ or absorb impact based on fragility.
    5.  **Impact Detection & Adjustment:**  Force sensors detect impact.  If item is unstable, elements subtly adjust to maintain balance.
*   **Power/Data Bus:**  Utilize a mesh network topology for redundancy and reliability.  Each element communicates directly with neighboring elements and the central control module.
*   **Materials:** Lightweight, high-strength polymer frame for array structure. Replaceable surface layers on elements with variable friction (e.g., silicone, rubber, micro-bristles).
*   **Safety Features:** Emergency stop mechanism.  Overload protection for actuators.  Soft landing surfaces to minimize damage to items.
*   **Pseudocode – Element Control:**

```
function adjustElement(elementID, targetAnglePitch, targetAngleYaw, targetHeight) {
  currentAnglePitch = getElementPitch(elementID)
  currentAngleYaw = getElementYaw(elementID)
  currentHeight = getElementHeight(elementID)

  pitchAdjustment = targetAnglePitch - currentAnglePitch
  yawAdjustment = targetAngleYaw - currentAngleYaw
  heightAdjustment = targetHeight - currentHeight

  moveActuatorPitch(elementID, pitchAdjustment)
  moveActuatorYaw(elementID, yawAdjustment)
  moveActuatorHeight(elementID, heightAdjustment)
}

function createNest(itemCharacteristics, landingCoordinates, velocity) {
  nestFootprint = calculateFootprint(itemCharacteristics, velocity)
  activeElements = findElementsWithinFootprint(nestFootprint)

  for (element in activeElements) {
    targetAngle = calculateAngle(itemCharacteristics, landingCoordinates)
    adjustElement(element, targetAngle, 0, 0)
  }
}
```

**Innovation:**  Moves beyond simple receiving location adjustment to a dynamic, adaptive system that actively shapes itself to reliably catch items with varying characteristics and trajectories.  Allows for more aggressive tossing speeds and trajectories, increasing throughput. Could facilitate handling of delicate or oddly shaped items.
