## Dynamic Predictive Geofence Adjustment via Swarm-Learned Decay Rates

**Concept:** Expand the existing discrepancy distribution system to *dynamically adjust geofence sizes* based on the collective prediction of discrepancy lifespan from a ‘swarm’ of vehicles. Current systems broadcast within a fixed geofence. This system learns decay rates for discrepancy relevance and shrinks/expands geofences accordingly, minimizing redundant broadcasts and maximizing timely information delivery.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Processing – Vehicle Agent:**

*   **Sensor Inputs:** Standard sensor suite (GPS, LiDAR, cameras, etc.) + existing discrepancy data feeds.
*   **Discrepancy Identification:** As per the existing patent (identify discrepancies between sensor data and provided data).
*   **Initial Relevance Score:** Assign each identified discrepancy an initial relevance score (IRS) based on severity (magnitude of difference) and type (atmospheric, traffic, etc.).
*   **Decay Rate Prediction Module:** 
    *   Utilize a localized, on-vehicle machine learning model (e.g., a small neural network) trained on historical discrepancy data & environmental factors.
    *   Input: IRS, discrepancy type, time of day, weather conditions, road type, vehicle speed, population density (estimated via connected car data).
    *   Output: Predicted decay rate (percentage reduction in relevance per unit time).
*   **Decay Rate Broadcasting:** Periodically broadcast predicted decay rate alongside the discrepancy data. Frequency: 1-5 Hz. Protocol: Utilize existing communication channels (V2V, V2I).

**2. Geofence Adjustment – Roadside Unit (RSU) / Cloud Server:**

*   **Data Aggregation:** RSUs/Cloud collect discrepancy data *and* predicted decay rates from surrounding vehicles.
*   **Weighted Averaging:** Calculate a weighted average decay rate for each discrepancy type within a given area. Weighting factors: Vehicle reliability score (derived from historical data), sensor accuracy, network signal strength.
*   **Dynamic Geofence Calculation:**
    *   For each discrepancy:
        *   Estimate remaining lifespan based on averaged decay rate.
        *   Calculate geofence radius based on estimated lifespan and a target broadcast range (e.g., ensure 90% of affected vehicles receive the information within the lifespan).
        *   Adjust geofence size accordingly.
*   **Broadcast Optimization:** Broadcast discrepancy information only to vehicles within the dynamically adjusted geofence.

**3. Cloud-Based Model Refinement:**

*   **Lifespan Validation:** Collect real-world data on discrepancy persistence (e.g., how long a road closure actually lasts).
*   **Model Retraining:** Periodically retrain the localized on-vehicle machine learning models using the validated lifespan data.
*   **Federated Learning:** Utilize federated learning to update models on individual vehicles without transmitting raw data, preserving privacy.

**Pseudocode (RSU Geofence Adjustment):**

```
function adjust_geofence(discrepancy_data, decay_rates):
  averaged_decay_rate = calculate_average_decay_rate(decay_rates)
  estimated_lifespan = calculate_estimated_lifespan(discrepancy_data, averaged_decay_rate)
  target_radius = estimated_lifespan * vehicle_speed  // Simplified calculation
  adjusted_geofence = create_geofence(current_location, target_radius)
  return adjusted_geofence

function calculate_average_decay_rate(decay_rates):
  // Weight decay rates based on vehicle reliability, sensor quality, etc.
  weighted_sum = 0
  total_weight = 0
  for decay_rate, weight in decay_rates:
    weighted_sum += decay_rate * weight
    total_weight += weight
  return weighted_sum / total_weight
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   RSUs require increased processing power for real-time geofence calculations.
*   Vehicles require sufficient on-board processing for decay rate prediction.
*   High-bandwidth, low-latency communication channels are essential.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced network congestion.
*   Improved information accuracy.
*   Enhanced safety and efficiency.
*   Adaptive system response to changing conditions.
