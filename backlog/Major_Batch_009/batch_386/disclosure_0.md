## Modular, Self-Reconfiguring Container System

**Concept:** Expand beyond single-unit foldable containers to a system of interconnected, modular containers capable of autonomous reconfiguration based on load, environment, and robotic instruction.

**Specifications:**

*   **Container Units:** Base units similar in size/footprint to the referenced patent, constructed from lightweight, high-strength composite material. Each unit possesses:
    *   Rotating side/bottom walls with locking mechanisms (as per the patent).
    *   Integrated proximity/contact sensors on all edges.
    *   Embedded, short-range wireless communication module (Bluetooth Mesh/UWB).
    *   Standardized docking interfaces (magnetic/mechanical) on all sides and bottom.
    *   Internal structural grid for mounting accessories/dividers.
    *   Small, high-torque electric actuators for wall rotation and locking/unlocking.
    *   Replaceable wheel modules (omnidirectional/standard)
*   **Docking System:** Precision docking interfaces using a combination of:
    *   High-strength magnets for initial alignment and secure attachment.
    *   Mechanical interlocking features for added stability and load transfer.
    *   Active dampening system to absorb impact during docking.
*   **Reconfiguration Logic (Software):**
    *   Centralized or distributed control architecture.
    *   Load sensing: Each container unit measures its own weight and the weight distribution within.
    *   Environment sensing: Integrated sensors (LiDAR/cameras) detect obstacles, floor type, and available space.
    *   Path planning: Algorithms determine optimal container arrangement for efficient movement and access.
    *   Robotic communication: Interface with robotic systems for automated reconfiguration and relocation.
    *   Dynamic resizing: Ability to automatically expand or contract the container array based on load and space constraints.
*   **Power System:**
    *   Wireless charging capability via induction.
    *   Integrated battery backup for emergency operation.
    *   Energy harvesting: Utilize piezoelectric elements to generate power from movement/vibration.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Mobile app for monitoring container status, controlling reconfiguration, and managing inventory.
    *   Augmented Reality (AR) overlay for visualizing container layout and access points.

**Pseudocode (Reconfiguration Algorithm):**

```
// Input: Current container array, target load distribution, environment map

function reconfigure(array, targetLoad, environment) {

  // 1. Analyze load distribution and identify imbalances
  imbalances = calculateLoadImbalance(array, targetLoad)

  // 2. Evaluate environment for available space and obstacles
  availableSpace = analyzeEnvironment(environment)

  // 3. Generate reconfiguration options (e.g., shifting containers, adding/removing links)
  options = generateReconfigurationOptions(array, imbalances, availableSpace)

  // 4. Evaluate each option based on cost (energy, time, risk) and feasibility
  scoredOptions = scoreReconfigurationOptions(options)

  // 5. Select the optimal option
  optimalOption = selectOptimalOption(scoredOptions)

  // 6. Execute the reconfiguration (robotic manipulation, actuator control)
  executeReconfiguration(optimalOption)

  // 7. Verify the reconfiguration and adjust as needed
  verifyReconfiguration()
}
```

**Potential Applications:** Warehousing, logistics, disaster relief, temporary shelters, mobile work stations.
