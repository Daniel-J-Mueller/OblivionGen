## Dynamic DNS Reputation Scoring & Shunting

**Concept:** Extend the DNS management system to incorporate real-time reputation scoring of DNS servers and dynamically shunt queries based on this scoring. This creates a self-healing, adaptive DNS infrastructure, improving reliability and mitigating malicious activity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Reputation Data Sources:**

*   **Real-time Blacklist/Whitelist Feeds:** Integrate with multiple threat intelligence feeds (e.g., Spamhaus, AbuseIPDB) for immediate identification of malicious DNS servers.
*   **Query Performance Monitoring:** Track response times, error rates, and data transfer rates for each DNS server.  Deviations from baseline performance indicate potential issues (DoS attacks, server overload).
*   **Response Validation:** Implement a system to validate the integrity of DNS responses. Check for truncated responses, unexpected data lengths, and inconsistencies with expected data formats.
*   **Geolocation Analysis:** Monitor the geographic distribution of DNS server responses. Unusual patterns may indicate redirection attacks or compromised servers.
*   **Passive DNS Data:** Correlate DNS server behavior with historical DNS records to identify anomalies and potential threats.

**2. Scoring Algorithm:**

*   **Weighted Scoring:** Assign weights to each data source based on its reliability and relevance. For example, a confirmed blacklist entry carries a higher weight than a performance degradation.
*   **Decay Function:** Implement a decay function to reduce the impact of historical data. This allows the system to adapt quickly to changing conditions.
*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**  Use machine learning to dynamically adjust the weights based on observed correlations between data sources and actual DNS server behavior.
*   **Score Thresholds:** Define score thresholds to categorize DNS servers as "Trusted," "Neutral," or "Untrusted."

**3. Query Shunting Mechanism:**

*   **DNS Resolver Integration:** Modify the DNS resolver to incorporate the reputation scoring system.
*   **Priority-Based Resolution:** When a DNS query is received, the resolver queries a set of DNS servers, prioritized based on their reputation scores.
*   **Dynamic Server Exclusion:** If a DNS server's reputation score falls below a certain threshold, it is automatically excluded from the pool of active DNS servers.
*   **Adaptive Query Distribution:** Distribute queries across multiple DNS servers, weighted by their reputation scores.
*   **Automated Failover:**  In the event of a DNS server failure or performance degradation, automatically failover to a healthy server with a high reputation score.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Reputation Database:** A scalable database (e.g., Redis, Cassandra) to store reputation scores and related data.
*   **Scoring Engine:** A dedicated service to process reputation data and calculate scores.
*   **API Endpoint:** An API to allow other services to query reputation scores.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** A system to monitor the health of the reputation scoring system and alert administrators of potential issues.

**Pseudocode (Query Shunting):**

```
function resolveDNS(query):
  servers = getAvailableDNSservers()  // Get list of servers
  scoredServers = []

  for server in servers:
    score = getReputationScore(server) // Fetch score from DB
    scoredServers.append((server, score))

  sortedServers = sort(scoredServers, key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True) // Sort by score

  for server, score in sortedServers:
    try:
      response = queryDNS(server, query) // Attempt query
      return response
    except Exception as e:
      // Log error, decrement server score, attempt next server
      logError(e)
      decrementReputationScore(server)

  // If all servers fail, return an error
  return "Error: Unable to resolve DNS query"
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Behavioral Analysis:**  Use machine learning to detect anomalous DNS server behavior, even if it is not explicitly flagged by threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Predictive Scoring:**  Develop a model to predict future reputation scores based on historical data and observed trends.
*   **Decentralized Reputation System:**  Explore the use of blockchain technology to create a decentralized and tamper-proof reputation system.
*   **Client-Side Reputation:** Extend the reputation system to include client-side validation of DNS responses, further enhancing security.
