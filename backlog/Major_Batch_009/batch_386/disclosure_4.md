## Adaptive Communication Proxies & Dynamic Trust Scores

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple access code mediation to create dynamically adjusting communication proxies with trust scores influencing proxy behavior. This system moves beyond merely *allowing* or *denying* communication to modulating *how* communication happens based on relationship strength, contextual cues, and historical interactions.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **User Profile Module:** Stores comprehensive user preferences (communication styles, preferred channels, time constraints, sensitivity levels for different contacts), access codes (as per the base patent), and *dynamic trust scores* for each authorized third party. Trust scores are initialized based on user input and continuously updated (see section 3).
*   **Third-Party Profile Module:** Maintains minimal data on authorized third parties (contact details, allowed content types).
*   **Communication Proxy:**  The central intermediary. All communication between user and third party flows *through* this proxy. The proxy’s behavior is dictated by the dynamic trust score.
*   **Contextual Analysis Engine:**  Analyzes metadata associated with communication attempts (time of day, content keywords, communication channel, third-party location, etc.) to assess potential risk or sensitivity.

**2. Dynamic Trust Score System:**

*   **Initialization:** User assigns initial trust score (1-100) to each authorized third party.
*   **Positive Reinforcement:**
    *   User explicitly approves contact requests (+5 points).
    *   User responds positively to communication (based on sentiment analysis of response – +1-3 points).
    *   Third party adheres to user-defined communication restrictions (+1 point per adherence).
*   **Negative Reinforcement:**
    *   User reports unwanted contact (-10 points).
    *   Third party violates communication restrictions (-5 points).
    *   Sentiment analysis of user response indicates negative reaction (-2-5 points).
    *   User blocks third party (-100 points – effectively revokes access).
*   **Decay Mechanism:** Trust score slowly decays over time if no interaction occurs (simulating relationship drift).

**3. Proxy Behavior Modulation (based on trust score):**

*   **Score 90-100 (High Trust):** Direct, unfiltered communication. Minimal proxy intervention.
*   **Score 70-89 (Medium-High Trust):** Real-time summarization of third-party messages. User receives key points rather than full text (reducing information overload). Option for user to request full message.
*   **Score 50-69 (Medium Trust):**  Audio/video call transcription and summarization.  Proxy generates a concise transcript of calls and highlights important points.  User can review transcript before/after call.
*   **Score 30-49 (Low Trust):**  Text-only communication.  All audio/video content is blocked. Proxy flags potentially sensitive keywords and prompts user for confirmation before forwarding.
*   **Score 10-29 (Very Low Trust):**  Asynchronous communication only (e.g., email). All real-time communication is blocked. Messages are subject to rigorous filtering and summarization.
*   **Score 0-9 (Blocked):** No communication allowed.

**4. Pseudocode (Proxy Logic):**

```pseudocode
function handle_incoming_communication(communication_request):
  third_party_id = communication_request.source
  trust_score = get_trust_score(user_id, third_party_id)

  if trust_score <= 0:
    reject_communication()
    return

  if communication_request.type == "text":
    filtered_message = filter_sensitive_keywords(communication_request.content)
    forward_message_to_user(filtered_message)
  else if communication_request.type == "audio" or "video":
    if trust_score < 50:
      reject_communication() # Block real-time media
    else:
      transcription = generate_transcription(communication_request.content)
      summary = summarize_transcription(transcription)
      forward_summary_to_user(summary)
      # Optionally offer full transcription on request
```

**5. Additional Features:**

*   **Contextual Blocking:** Block communication attempts based on time of day, location, or detected keywords.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication for Third Parties:** Require additional authentication steps from third parties attempting to initiate contact.
*   **User-Defined Rules:** Allow users to create custom rules for communication filtering and blocking.
*    **Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing:** Utilize differential privacy techniques to share anonymized communication patterns with third parties for improved service delivery.
