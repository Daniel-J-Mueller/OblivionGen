## Adaptive Bitrate Streaming with Per-Scene Complexity Modulation

**Concept:** Extend adaptive bitrate streaming by dynamically adjusting bitrate *within* a single video segment based on scene complexity. Current ABR ladders treat each segment as a homogenous unit. This system analyzes each frame (or keyframe) within a segment and modulates the encoding parameters (quantization, motion estimation) to prioritize visual quality where it matters most—complex scenes—while reducing bitrate during simpler scenes.

**Specification:**

**1. Scene Complexity Analyzer (SCA):**

*   **Input:** Video frames (or keyframes) from the video file.
*   **Process:** 
    *   **Feature Extraction:** Extract features indicative of scene complexity:
        *   **Motion Vector Variance:** Measure the variance of motion vectors within a frame. High variance indicates complex motion.
        *   **Texture Complexity:** Utilize algorithms (e.g., Local Binary Patterns, Haralick features) to quantify the texture complexity of a frame.
        *   **Object Count:** Employ object detection models to estimate the number of objects in a frame. Higher object count often correlates with complexity.
        *   **Color Palette Size:** Larger, more diverse color palettes can indicate visual complexity.
    *   **Complexity Score:** Combine the extracted features into a single complexity score for each frame.  Weighted sum or machine learning model (trained on human perception data) can be used.
*   **Output:**  Complexity score for each frame (or keyframe).

**2. Dynamic Bitrate Modulator (DBM):**

*   **Input:** Complexity scores from the SCA, target bitrate for the segment, pre-defined bitrate modulation range (e.g., +/- 20% of target bitrate).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Bitrate Mapping:** Map complexity scores to bitrate adjustments. Higher complexity scores result in increased bitrate, and vice versa.  Lookup table or regression model can be used.
    *   **Frame-Level Bitrate Control:**  Adjust encoding parameters (quantization parameter, GOP size, motion estimation settings) for each frame based on the mapped bitrate adjustment.
    *   **Bitrate Constraint:** Implement a constraint to ensure the average bitrate of the segment remains close to the target bitrate. This can be achieved by smoothing the frame-level bitrate adjustments or by dynamically adjusting the modulation range.
*   **Output:** Frame-level encoding parameters.

**3. Segment Encoder:**

*   **Input:** Video frames, frame-level encoding parameters from DBM.
*   **Process:** Encode the video segment using the specified encoding parameters.
*   **Output:** Encoded video segment.

**4. Manifest Generator:**

*   **Input:** Encoded video segments at various bitrate levels.
*   **Process:** Generate an adaptive bitrate streaming manifest (e.g., HLS, DASH) that lists the available video segments at different bitrate levels.
*   **Output:** Adaptive bitrate streaming manifest.

**Pseudocode - DBM:**

```
function modulateBitrate(complexityScore, targetBitrate, modulationRange):
  bitrateAdjustment = complexityScore * modulationRange  // Scale complexity to bitrate adjustment
  adjustedBitrate = targetBitrate + bitrateAdjustment

  // Clamp adjusted bitrate to a reasonable range
  adjustedBitrate = max(minBitrate, min(maxBitrate, adjustedBitrate))

  // Calculate encoding parameters based on adjusted bitrate (example: QP)
  QP = calculateQP(adjustedBitrate)

  return QP
```

**System Components:**

*   **Content Data Store:** Stores the original video file.
*   **Preprocessing Module:** Runs the SCA to analyze video complexity.
*   **Encoding Farm:** Parallel processing units to encode video segments with dynamically adjusted parameters.
*   **Manifest Server:**  Hosts and serves the adaptive bitrate streaming manifest.



This allows for a finer-grained control of bitrate allocation, leading to improved visual quality for complex scenes and reduced bandwidth usage for simpler scenes.
