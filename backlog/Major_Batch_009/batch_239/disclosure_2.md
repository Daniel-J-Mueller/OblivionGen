## Adaptive Network Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the voice-controlled network provisioning to create dynamic "Network Personas" – pre-configured network settings and service access levels tailored to the user and device, activated via voice command. This goes beyond simple connection; it configures the *experience* of being on the network.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Profiles:** Cloud-based profiles containing network configuration parameters (SSID, VLAN, QoS, access control lists, VPN settings, allowed applications, bandwidth limits, content filtering, security protocols, etc.). Profiles are assigned to users/devices.
*   **Voice Trigger:** A wake word (“Network,”) followed by a persona name (“Guest,” “Work,” “Gaming,” “Kids”).
*   **Device Identification:** Device fingerprinting (MAC address, model, OS) combined with user authentication (voiceprint, PIN) to securely link the user to a device and the appropriate Persona.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:** Upon voice command, the system pushes the relevant Persona configuration to the device (via Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth, or other secure channels). This happens *before* full network access is granted.
*   **Multi-Device Synchronization:**  A single user can activate a Persona across multiple devices simultaneously.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrate location data (GPS, beacon) and time of day to suggest or automatically activate appropriate Personas. For example, "Home" profile when the user arrives, or "Work" when at a specified location during business hours.
*   **API for App Integration:** Third-party applications can request Persona activation based on user actions within the app. E.g., a video streaming app requests the “Gaming” Persona for optimal bandwidth.
*   **Emergency Override:** A designated "Emergency" Persona bypasses all restrictions for critical applications (e.g., emergency services, security cameras).

**Pseudocode (Persona Activation Sequence):**

```
//Device hears "Network, Gaming"

1.  Voice Recognition:  Identify command "Gaming"
2.  Device Identification:  Determine device MAC address, OS, User Voiceprint
3.  Authentication:  Verify user via voiceprint (or PIN)
4.  Profile Lookup:  Query cloud server for “Gaming” Persona associated with user/device
5.  Configuration Push:
    a. Establish secure connection (e.g., TLS) with device
    b. Send network configuration parameters (SSID, VLAN ID, QoS settings, firewall rules)
    c. Apply configuration to device’s network stack
6.  Network Access Granted:  Device connects to network with the applied Persona configuration
7.  Usage Monitoring: Track resource consumption and enforce limits specified in the Persona
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Speech-controlled device (existing system)
*   Cloud-based Persona management server
*   Secure communication channels (TLS/HTTPS)
*   Device network stack access (OS-level permissions)

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-powered Persona recommendations:** The system learns user preferences and suggests optimal Personas based on usage patterns.
*   **Persona sharing:** Allow users to create and share custom Personas with others.
*   **Dynamic Persona creation:** The system automatically creates Personas based on user activity and device context.
*   **Integration with IoT devices:**  Control IoT devices based on the active Persona.
