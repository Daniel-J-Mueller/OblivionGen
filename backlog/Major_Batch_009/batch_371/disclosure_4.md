**Dynamic Ecosystem Simulation with Behavioral AI**

**Core Concept:** Expand upon the adjustable rule sets to create a fully dynamic ecosystem where flora and fauna aren't just *placed* but *evolve* based on simulated needs, environmental factors, and interactions. This goes beyond object/terrain generation – it’s about creating a living world.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) Integration:** Implement an ABM system where every plant and animal within the virtual area is represented as an independent agent with individual stats (health, hunger, reproduction rate, fear level, etc.) and behavioral rules.

2.  **Need-Based Behavior:** Agents should operate based on a hierarchy of needs (food, water, shelter, reproduction, safety). These needs are impacted by the environment (weather, time of day, terrain) and agent interactions.

3.  **Environmental Impact Modeling:**
    *   Terrain Modification: Agent actions (e.g., burrowing, tree felling, path creation) should dynamically alter terrain.
    *   Resource Depletion/Regeneration:  Resource availability (food, water) should be modeled, with depletion based on consumption and regeneration based on environmental factors.
    *   Pollution/Waste:  Agent activity can generate pollution/waste that impacts the environment and other agents.

4.  **Behavioral AI & Learning:**
    *   Reinforcement Learning: Agents should employ reinforcement learning to optimize their behavior based on environmental rewards/penalties. This allows for emergent behaviors and adaptation.
    *   Social Interaction:  Agents should exhibit social behaviors (e.g., flocking, hunting in packs, establishing territories) based on species and individual traits.
    *   Predator-Prey Dynamics:  Implement a realistic predator-prey system with hunting strategies, evasion tactics, and population control.

5.  **Genetic Algorithm for Evolution:** Implement a basic genetic algorithm where agent traits (size, speed, intelligence, camouflage) are subject to mutation and natural selection. This allows populations to evolve over time in response to environmental pressures.

6.  **Rule Set Integration:** The existing rule sets (terrain, object) become ‘environmental parameters’ influencing agent behavior and evolution. These parameters can be adjusted in real-time to create specific ecosystem scenarios.

7.  **Data Streaming & Visualization:**
    *   Ecosystem Metrics: Track key ecosystem metrics (population size, biodiversity, resource levels) and visualize them in real-time.
    *   Agent Tracking: Allow users to select and track individual agents to observe their behavior and interactions.

**Pseudocode (Core Agent Update Loop):**

```
FOR EACH agent IN ecosystem:
    assess_needs(agent) // Determine hunger, thirst, safety levels
    select_action(agent) // Choose action based on needs and environment
    execute_action(agent) // Perform action (e.g., move, eat, reproduce)
    update_stats(agent) // Adjust stats based on action and environment
    update_environment(agent) // Modify terrain or resources based on action
END FOR
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond static world generation to create a *living* world with emergent behavior and evolutionary dynamics. The integration of ABM, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms creates a level of realism and complexity not typically found in virtual environments. The ability to adjust environmental parameters in real-time allows for the creation of dynamic and unpredictable ecosystems.
