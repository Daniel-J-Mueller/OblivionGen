## Dynamic Packet Shaping via Predictive Congestion Control

**Concept:** Augment the existing credit-based policing mechanism with a predictive element to *shape* traffic proactively, rather than simply policing it reactively. This leverages observed traffic patterns to anticipate congestion and adjust credit allocation *before* it occurs, improving overall network throughput and reducing latency.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Traffic History Buffer:** Each policing context will maintain a rolling buffer of packet inter-arrival times and packet sizes (minimum 64 entries, configurable). This buffer stores recent traffic behavior for each flow.

2.  **Prediction Engine:** A simple time-series forecasting model (e.g., Exponential Smoothing, or a lightweight Kalman Filter) is applied to the traffic history buffer. The model predicts future packet arrival rates and expected packet sizes.  The prediction horizon is configurable (default 10ms).

3.  **Dynamic Credit Adjustment:** The pipeline will incorporate a "Credit Adjustment Factor" (CAF). The CAF is calculated by the prediction engine based on predicted congestion. 
    *   If the prediction indicates increasing congestion (e.g., rising arrival rate, larger average packet size), the CAF increases, effectively allocating more credits *before* the congestion hits.
    *   If the prediction indicates decreasing congestion, the CAF decreases, reducing credit allocation.
    *   CAF range: 0.5 - 1.5 (configurable).  A value of 1.0 maintains the original credit allocation rate.
    *   The *additional* credits added during each cycle is `(predicted_additional_credits * CAF)`.

4.  **Congestion Signal Integration:** Incorporate a congestion signal from the network itself (e.g., Explicit Congestion Notification - ECN). The ECN signal modulates the CAF, providing real-time feedback. This is a multiplicative factor applied to the CAF calculated by the prediction engine.

5.  **Pipeline Modifications:** 
    *   Add a prediction stage to the pipeline that reads the traffic history buffer and calculates the predicted traffic volume.
    *   Insert a CAF calculation stage that applies the prediction and congestion signals.
    *   Modify the credit calculation to incorporate the CAF.
    *   Add a "buffer occupancy" metric for each flow to gauge the effect of traffic shaping.

6.  **Pseudocode:**

```
// Within the pipeline for each packet

// 1. Read policing context (credits_available, previous_counter_value)

// 2.  Calculate additional_credits (as before)

// 3.  Read Traffic History Buffer for this flow

// 4.  Predict future traffic volume (arrival rate, packet size) â€“ Prediction Engine

// 5.  Calculate Credit Adjustment Factor (CAF)
CAF = 1.0  // Default
If (predicted congestion increasing) {
    CAF = 1.0 + (congestion_increase_factor * predicted_increase) // congestion increase factor is a configurable parameter
}

If (ECN signal received){
    CAF = CAF * (1 + ECN_influence) //ECN_influence is configurable
}

// 6. Calculate first_number_of_credits
first_number_of_credits = additional_credits + credits_available

// 7. Determine Forward/Drop based on first_number_of_credits

// 8. Update credits_available based on Forward/Drop (as before)

```
