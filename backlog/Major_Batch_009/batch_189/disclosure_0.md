## Secure Credential Orchestration via Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) & Verifiable Credentials

**Concept:** Expand the trusted channel concept beyond a single point-to-point communication and into a web of trust leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). This allows for more robust, user-controlled, and privacy-preserving credential management.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **DID Provider:** A service that issues and manages DIDs for users/devices.
*   **VC Issuer:** An entity authorized to issue VCs attesting to specific claims about a user (e.g., account ownership, security level, device registration). Could be the same as the credential management endpoint described in the patent, or a separate entity.
*   **Credential Orchestration Service (COS):** A new service responsible for coordinating the exchange of VCs between the VC Issuer, the user’s DID, and the service requesting access (the application).
*   **User Agent/Wallet:** An application on the user's device that manages the user’s DID, stores VCs, and interacts with the COS.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Account Linking & DID Creation:**  When a user links an account, a DID is created and associated with the user's identity. This DID acts as the user’s unique identifier in the decentralized web.
2.  **VC Issuance:** The VC Issuer issues VCs to the user’s DID, proving ownership of the account, current security posture (e.g., MFA enabled), or device registration. These VCs are digitally signed by the Issuer.
3.  **Access Request:**  An application requests access to an account.
4.  **VC Presentation Request:** The application sends a request to the COS specifying the required VCs (e.g., “proof of account ownership”, “proof of MFA enabled”). The request also includes a challenge to prevent replay attacks.
5.  **VC Selection & Presentation:** The COS forwards the request to the user’s DID (via the User Agent). The User Agent prompts the user to select the relevant VCs and signs a presentation of these VCs with the user’s private key.
6.  **Verification:** The presentation is returned to the COS, which verifies the signatures, the validity of the VCs (checking for revocation), and confirms that the challenge is valid.
7.  **Access Granted:** The COS informs the application that the verification was successful. Access is granted.

**3. Pseudocode (COS - simplified):**

```
function handleAccessRequest(applicationId, accountId, requiredVCs):
    challenge = generateRandomChallenge()
    request = {
        applicationId: applicationId,
        accountId: accountId,
        requiredVCs: requiredVCs,
        challenge: challenge
    }
    userDID = getUserDID(accountId) // Lookup user's DID based on account ID
    sendRequestToUserDID(userDID, request)

function handleUserResponse(userDID, response):
    presentation = response.presentation
    signature = response.signature

    if verifySignature(presentation, signature, userDID):
        // Verify each VC in the presentation
        for vc in presentation.vcs:
            if not verifyVC(vc):
                return "VC verification failed"

        // Verify challenge
        if not verifyChallenge(presentation, challenge):
            return "Challenge verification failed"

        return "Verification successful"
    else:
        return "Signature verification failed"
```

**4.  Novelty & Advantages:**

*   **User Control:** The user has full control over which VCs are presented, enhancing privacy.
*   **Interoperability:** DIDs and VCs are standardized, promoting interoperability across different systems.
*   **Reduced Reliance on Central Authorities:**  The decentralized nature reduces reliance on a single point of failure or control.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Cryptographic signatures and verifiable credentials provide a high level of security and trust.
*   **Scalability:** The decentralized architecture can scale to accommodate a large number of users and applications.
