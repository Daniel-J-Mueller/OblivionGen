## Decentralized Key Orchestration with Attestation

**Concept:** Expand the key holder concept to a fully decentralized network leveraging zero-knowledge proofs and attestations to manage and authorize cryptographic operations, moving beyond reliance on specific, identified "key holders".

**Specs:**

*   **Network Layer:** A permissioned blockchain or Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) network where nodes represent potential key custodians. Each custodian possesses a portion of the overall key material (Shamir's Secret Sharing or similar).
*   **Key Fragment Management:** Each key fragment is associated with a unique node ID and is encrypted using a public key derived from the node ID.  Nodes *only* have access to their specific key fragment.
*   **Request Initiation:** A requesting entity (e.g., a user or system) submits a cryptographic request including:
    *   Operation Type (e.g., encrypt, decrypt, sign).
    *   Data to be operated on.
    *   Policy ID (defining authorization requirements).
    *   Attestation Request ID.
*   **Attestation Protocol:**
    1.  Requestor broadcasts Attestation Request ID to the network.
    2.  Nodes that satisfy the Policy ID (e.g., possess a credential confirming compliance with a specific security standard) respond with a zero-knowledge proof demonstrating compliance *without revealing* the credential itself.
    3.  A threshold number of valid proofs are collected (e.g., requiring 5 out of 10 responding nodes).
    4.  These nodes collaboratively reconstruct the necessary key material (using secret sharing reconstruction).  This key material is *never* stored or exposed in plaintext.
*   **Operation Execution:** The reconstructed key is used to perform the requested cryptographic operation *within* the attesting nodes.  The result is returned to the requestor.
*   **Auditability:**  All attestations and cryptographic operations are logged on the blockchain/DAG, providing a tamper-proof audit trail.

**Pseudocode (Attestation & Operation Execution):**

```
// Node Function: Receive Attestation Request
function receiveAttestationRequest(request) {
  if (satisfiesPolicy(request.policyID)) {
    generateZeroKnowledgeProof(request.policyID);
    broadcastProof(request.attestationRequestID, proof);
  }
}

// Orchestrator Function: Collect Proofs & Reconstruct Key
function orchestrateOperation(request) {
  collectZeroKnowledgeProofs(request.attestationRequestID);
  if (sufficientProofsCollected()) {
    reconstructKey(keyFragments); // Shamir's or similar
    result = performOperation(request.data, reconstructKey);
    return result;
  } else {
    return "Insufficient Attestations";
  }
}

// Operation Functions (performed within attesting nodes)
function performOperation(data, key) {
  //Perform encryption/decryption/signing using 'key' on 'data'
  return result;
}
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond designated key holders to a dynamic, policy-driven system where authorization is established through cryptographic proofs, eliminating single points of failure and enhancing trust. It enables fine-grained access control and verifiable compliance with security policies.
