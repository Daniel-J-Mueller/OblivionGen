## Adaptive Query Shaping via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Dynamically alter query structure *during* execution based on real-time database performance feedback, guided by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. This goes beyond simply tagging queries for cost attribution; it's about actively *optimizing* them on the fly.

**Motivation:** Static query plans are suboptimal in dynamic environments. Database load, data distribution, and resource availability change constantly.  A system that can learn to adjust query structure in response to these changes can significantly improve performance and reduce cost. This is distinct from traditional query optimization which happens *before* execution.

**System Components:**

1.  **RL Agent:** A Deep Q-Network (DQN) or similar RL algorithm. State: Database performance metrics (CPU utilization, I/O latency, query execution time, estimated cost), Query structure (tree representation of the query plan), Thread identifier (as in the patent). Action:  A set of query transformation operations (see below). Reward: Reduction in query execution time *and* database load (a weighted combination).
2.  **Query Transformer:** Module responsible for applying the actions selected by the RL agent to the executing query.
3.  **Performance Monitor:**  Continuously tracks database performance metrics and provides feedback to the RL agent.
4.  **Query Structure Representation:**  A standardized, programmable representation of query plans.  (e.g. a directed acyclic graph)

**Query Transformation Operations (Actions):**

*   **Index Hints:**  Force the use of a specific index.
*   **Join Reordering:**  Change the order in which tables are joined.
*   **Predicate Pushdown:** Move WHERE clause conditions closer to the data source.
*   **Subquery Unnesting:**  Rewrite subqueries as joins.
*   **Materialization Control:**  Choose whether to materialize intermediate results.
*   **Parallelization Degree:** Adjust the level of query parallelism.
*   **Selective Column Projection:** Limit the number of columns retrieved.

**Workflow:**

1.  A query arrives at the database.
2.  The query is initially parsed and a baseline query plan is generated.
3.  The RL agent observes the initial query plan and database performance metrics (State).
4.  The agent selects a query transformation action based on its current policy.
5.  The Query Transformer applies the transformation to the executing query plan. (This is done *during* execution â€“ potentially rewriting parts of the plan on the fly).
6.  The Performance Monitor tracks the impact of the transformation on query execution time and database load.
7.  The Performance Monitor provides a reward signal to the RL agent.
8.  The agent updates its policy based on the reward signal.
9. Steps 5-8 are repeated iteratively until the query completes.

**Pseudocode (RL Agent - Simplified):**

```python
class QAgent:
  def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, learning_rate):
    self.Q = np.zeros((state_size, action_size)) # Q-table
    self.learning_rate = learning_rate

  def choose_action(self, state, epsilon):
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
      return np.random.randint(0, len(self.Q[0])) # Explore
    else:
      return np.argmax(self.Q[state]) # Exploit

  def learn(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
    old_value = self.Q[state, action]
    next_max = np.max(self.Q[next_state])
    new_value = (1 - self.learning_rate) * old_value + self.learning_rate * (reward + next_max)
    self.Q[state, action] = new_value
```

**Integration with Patent:**

The `first identifier` from the patent's approach would be incorporated into the `state` representation observed by the RL agent. This allows the agent to learn how different application programming interfaces (APIs) impact database performance and optimize queries accordingly. The cost information associated with the identifier could also be factored into the `reward` signal, incentivizing the agent to reduce the cost of each API invocation.  Essentially, we move from *attributing* cost to *actively optimizing* queries based on API-specific cost profiles.
