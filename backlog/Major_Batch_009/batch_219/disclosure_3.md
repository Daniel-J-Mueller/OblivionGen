**Dynamic Skill-Based Matchmaking with Predictive Elo**

**Concept:** Expand on the customer-generated matchmaking by incorporating a predictive Elo system, not just based on win/loss, but *predicted* performance within a game session, and dynamically adjusting matchmaking parameters mid-session.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Predictive Elo Engine:**
    *   Input: Player characteristic data (from the patent), historical match data, in-game telemetry (actions per minute, accuracy, resource management, strategic choices – captured in real-time).
    *   Process: Machine learning model (likely a recurrent neural network) trained to predict a player’s likely contribution to a match *before* it begins and *during* its execution. This is distinct from static Elo, which reflects overall skill.
    *   Output: A "Predicted Elo" score for each player, updated continuously during the session. This score is *separate* from their standard Elo.

2.  **Dynamic Matchmaking Parameters:**
    *   Initial Matchmaking:  Use the customer's algorithm, blended with Predicted Elo.  The weighting between customer algorithm factors and Predicted Elo can be a configurable parameter.
    *   Mid-Session Adjustment: Monitor Predicted Elo *during* gameplay. If a significant disparity emerges (e.g., one player's Predicted Elo plummets due to poor performance, or one player is drastically outperforming expectations), trigger a *dynamic adjustment* to the match. This adjustment could take several forms:
        *   **Assistive Measures:** Subtly adjust game parameters for the underperforming player (e.g., increased resource generation, minor damage boost, slightly faster movement speed).  The goal is to bring them back into contention, *not* to guarantee a win.
        *   **Challenge Increase:** For an overperforming player, subtly increase the difficulty (e.g., spawn stronger enemies, reduce resource availability).
        *   **Team Rebalancing:** (Most Complex) If the game supports team-based play, dynamically shift players between teams to re-establish balance, based on *current* Predicted Elo. This would require careful implementation to avoid disrupting gameplay.

3.  **Matchmaking API Extensions:**
    *   `matchmake_predictive(customer_algorithm, player_characteristics)`: Initiates a match using the customer's algorithm and Predictive Elo.
    *   `get_predicted_elo(player_id)`: Returns the current Predicted Elo for a player.
    *   `trigger_dynamic_adjustment(match_id, adjustment_type, adjustment_parameters)`:  Allows the matchmaking service to trigger a dynamic adjustment within a match.

4.  **Telemetry Data Requirements:**
    *   Real-time capture of key in-game actions (as listed above).
    *   Timestamps for all actions.
    *   Game state data (e.g., player health, resources, objectives).

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Adjustment Trigger):**

```
function trigger_dynamic_adjustment(match_id, adjustment_type, adjustment_parameters):
  match = get_match(match_id)
  elo_disparity = calculate_elo_disparity(match.players)

  if elo_disparity > threshold:
    if adjustment_type == "assist":
      apply_assist(match.underperforming_player, adjustment_parameters)
    elif adjustment_type == "challenge":
      apply_challenge(match.overperforming_player, adjustment_parameters)
    elif adjustment_type == "rebalance":
      rebalance_teams(match.teams, match.players)
    else:
      log_error("Invalid adjustment type")

  log_adjustment(match_id, adjustment_type, adjustment_parameters)
```

**Novelty:** This isn't just about finding players of similar skill. It's about actively *managing* the match experience to create a more engaging and competitive environment, even when skill disparities emerge. It shifts the focus from pre-match balance to *in-match* balance. The predictive element is key - anticipating performance and adjusting accordingly.
