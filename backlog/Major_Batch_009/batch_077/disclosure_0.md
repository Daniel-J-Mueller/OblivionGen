## Personalized Environmental 'Mood' Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend the declarative intent/action learning to proactively adjust environmental settings (lighting, temperature, audio) to *match* a deduced user 'mood' derived from their declarative statements, rather than simply responding to direct requests. This goes beyond simple automation; it anticipates user needs based on emotional cues present in language.

**Specs:**

1.  **Mood Lexicon & Embedding:**  Develop an expanded mood lexicon, going beyond basic emotions (happy, sad, angry). Include nuanced states (e.g., contemplative, energetic, serene, frustrated) and associated linguistic features (keywords, sentence structure, intensity markers).  Create high-dimensional embeddings for each mood, allowing for similarity calculations.
2.  **Declarative Statement Analysis Module:** This module analyzes incoming declarative statements for mood indicators.  It utilizes:
    *   **Keyword Spotting:** Identify mood-related keywords.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:**  Determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
    *   **Contextual Analysis:**  Use surrounding sentences/dialog history to refine the mood assessment. (e.g. “It’s raining” alone is neutral, but “It’s raining *again*, just what I needed” is frustrated).
    *   **Intensity Detection:**  Quantify the strength of the expressed emotion (e.g., mildly annoyed vs. furious).
3.  **Environmental Mapping & Control:** Define a mapping between deduced mood states and environmental settings.  This mapping should be customizable per user.
    *   **Lighting:** Brightness, color temperature (warm/cool), color hue.
    *   **Temperature:** Adjust thermostat setting.
    *   **Audio:** Music genre, volume, ambient soundscapes.
4.  **Action Prediction & Confirmation:** When a declarative statement is received, predict the most appropriate environmental 'mood' setting based on the statement analysis.  Present the predicted setting to the user with a prompt:  “It sounds like you're feeling [mood]. Would you like me to adjust the lighting to [setting], the temperature to [setting] and play [music genre]?” The user can confirm, modify, or decline.
5.  **Learning & Personalization:**  Continuously learn user preferences over time. If the user frequently overrides the predicted settings, adjust the mapping accordingly.  Utilize reinforcement learning to optimize the mapping for maximum user satisfaction.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function analyze_statement(statement):
  mood_vector = mood_lexicon.embed(statement)
  sentiment_score = sentiment_analyzer.score(statement)
  contextual_features = contextual_analyzer.extract(statement, dialog_history)
  mood = mood_classifier.predict(mood_vector, sentiment_score, contextual_features)
  return mood

function predict_environment(mood, user_profile):
  environment_mapping = user_profile.get_environment_mapping()
  lighting = environment_mapping.get_lighting(mood)
  temperature = environment_mapping.get_temperature(mood)
  music = environment_mapping.get_music(mood)
  return lighting, temperature, music

function adjust_environment(lighting, temperature, music):
  # Control environmental devices
  set_lighting(lighting)
  set_temperature(temperature)
  play_music(music)

on_receive_statement(statement):
  mood = analyze_statement(statement)
  lighting, temperature, music = predict_environment(mood, user_profile)
  prompt = "It sounds like you're feeling " + mood + ".  Would you like me to adjust the lighting to " + lighting + ", the temperature to " + temperature + ", and play " + music + "?"
  display_prompt(prompt)
  on_receive_response(response):
    if response == "yes":
      adjust_environment(lighting, temperature, music)
    else if response == "override":
      # Allow user to manually adjust settings
    else:
      # Do nothing
    # Update user preferences based on response
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Multimodal Input:** Integrate data from other sensors (e.g., facial expressions, voice tone) to improve mood detection accuracy.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Incorporate time of day, location, and user activity into the mood prediction process.
*   **Proactive Adjustment:**  Adjust environmental settings *before* the user explicitly states their mood, based on inferred emotional state.
*   **Privacy:** Implement robust privacy controls to protect user data.
