## Dynamic Key Sharding with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the internal key generation and usage beyond simple operation-specific keys to a system of dynamically sharded keys with a built-in temporal decay mechanism. This allows for granular access control and automated key revocation, reducing the attack surface and complexity of key management.

**Specs:**

**1. Key Sharding Module:**

*   **Function:** Responsible for splitting a master internal key into multiple shards.
*   **Algorithm:** Utilize a Secret Sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing) to generate *n* shards from a single key.
*   **Sharding Policy:** Shards are assigned to specific data blocks or operations.  This is configurable and adaptable.
*   **Threshold:**  Define a threshold *t* such that *t* shards are required to reconstruct the original key.
*   **Location:** Shards are distributed across the storage device's non-volatile memory, potentially leveraging different physical locations for increased security.

**2. Temporal Decay Mechanism:**

*   **Key Lifetime:** Each shard is assigned a Time-To-Live (TTL) value. This defines how long the shard remains valid.
*   **Decay Algorithm:** Implement a cryptographic decay function. This function degrades the shardâ€™s cryptographic strength over time, making it unusable after the TTL expires. A possible function could involve repeatedly hashing the shard with a time-dependent value.
*   **Automatic Revocation:** When a shard's TTL expires, it is automatically marked as invalid and removed from the active shard pool. The data/operation secured by that shard becomes inaccessible without re-keying.

**3. Operation Flow:**

1.  **Data Ingress/Operation Request:** When data is written or an operation is requested, the system generates a request for key shards.
2.  **Shard Allocation:** The Key Sharding Module allocates the necessary number of valid shards based on the operation and data block.
3.  **Shard Reconstruction:** The allocated shards are combined to reconstruct the master key.  This is done entirely within the storage device's secure hardware.
4.  **Operation Execution:** The operation is executed using the reconstructed key.
5.  **Shard Decay Monitoring:** A background process continuously monitors shard TTLs. Expired shards are automatically revoked.

**4. Pseudocode (Shard Decay Monitoring):**

```
function monitor_shard_decay() {
  for each shard in shard_pool {
    if (current_time > shard.ttl) {
      mark_shard_as_invalid(shard)
      remove_shard_from_pool(shard)
      // potentially trigger re-keying for associated data/operations
    }
  }
  // run every X seconds
  schedule(monitor_shard_decay, X)
}
```

**5. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Dedicated Cryptographic Hardware: AES engine, true random number generator (TRNG), secure key storage.
*   Non-Volatile Memory: Sufficient capacity to store multiple shards and related metadata.
*   Secure Boot: To ensure the integrity of the firmware.

**6. Benefits:**

*   Reduced Attack Surface: Compromising a single shard does not reveal the master key.
*   Automated Key Rotation: TTL-based revocation eliminates the need for manual key rotation.
*   Granular Access Control: Shards can be assigned to specific data blocks or operations, providing fine-grained access control.
*   Enhanced Data Security: Dynamic key sharding and temporal decay provide a robust defense against key compromise.
