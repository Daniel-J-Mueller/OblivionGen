## Adaptive Audio Scene Reconstruction

**Core Concept:** Leverage the jitter buffer’s data – not just for playback continuity, but as a foundational element for reconstructing a spatial audio scene. The incoming packets, even with variable latency, contain directional and ambient information. This system aims to synthesize a more immersive experience by extrapolating and ‘filling in’ gaps in the audio scene data based on jitter buffer contents and predictive modeling.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Standard audio data packets (similar to those described in the source patent) *plus* metadata indicating source direction (azimuth/elevation) for each packet, and potentially ambient sound classification (e.g., “street noise”, “speech”, “music”).  This metadata would need to be incorporated at the source/encoding stage, not necessarily within the packets themselves.
*   **Jitter Buffer Enhancement:** The jitter buffer now functions as a short-term "scene memory".  Incoming packets are not simply queued for playback; the audio data is processed to extract relevant spatial and ambient features.
*   **Scene Graph Construction:**  A dynamic scene graph is built based on the extracted features. Nodes represent sound sources (mapped from packet metadata), and edges represent relationships (distance, occlusion). The jitter buffer’s content and associated metadata constantly update this graph.
*   **Latency-Aware Extrapolation:** When a gap in audio arrival is detected (jitter), the system doesn't *just* accelerate playback. It uses the scene graph to *extrapolate* the expected sound field. This involves:
    *   **Sound Source Tracking:** Predict the likely future position and characteristics of sound sources based on their recent history.
    *   **Ambient Sound Synthesis:** Generate plausible ambient sounds to "fill in" the gaps, based on the prevailing environmental classification (derived from packet metadata).
    *   **Room Impulse Response Modeling:**  Simulate the acoustic characteristics of the environment to realistically position and mix the extrapolated sounds.
*   **Ambisonic Rendering:** The final audio is rendered using ambisonics (or other spatial audio formats) to create a truly immersive 3D soundscape.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop - Runs for each incoming audio packet

function processPacket(packet, metadata) {

  // Extract features (direction, ambient classification)
  features = extractFeatures(metadata);

  // Update scene graph
  updateSceneGraph(features);

  // Check for jitter/gaps
  if (detectJitter()) {

    // Extrapolate sound field
    predictedSound = extrapolateSoundField();

    // Mix predicted sound with buffered audio
    mixedAudio = mixAudio(bufferedAudio, predictedSound);

    // Render spatial audio
    spatialAudio = renderSpatialAudio(mixedAudio);

    // Playback spatial audio
    playbackAudio(spatialAudio);

  } else {

    // Playback buffered audio
    playbackAudio(bufferedAudio);
  }
}

function extrapolateSoundField() {
    // Predict sound source positions and characteristics
    predictedSources = predictSoundSources();

    // Synthesize ambient sounds
    ambientSound = synthesizeAmbientSound();

    // Apply room impulse response
    finalSound = applyRoomImpulseResponse(predictedSources, ambientSound);

    return finalSound;
}
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   **Processing Power:**  This system requires significant processing power for scene graph updates, extrapolation, and spatial audio rendering.  GPU acceleration would be highly beneficial.
*   **Memory:** The scene graph and buffered audio data require substantial memory.
*   **Audio Codec:** A high-fidelity audio codec is essential to preserve the quality of the spatial audio.
*   **Software Framework:**  A suitable audio programming framework (e.g., JUCE, SuperCollider) would simplify development.
*   **Metadata Integration:** The most challenging aspect is reliably incorporating spatial and ambient metadata at the source. Standardizing a metadata format would be crucial.
