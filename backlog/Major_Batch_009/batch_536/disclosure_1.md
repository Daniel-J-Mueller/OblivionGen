## Dynamic Bioluminescence Wall Light

**Concept:** A wall light that incorporates genetically engineered bioluminescent bacteria within a transparent, nutrient-rich gel matrix. The light emitted isn’t static; it *responds* to environmental stimuli like sound, touch, or even air quality.

**Components:**

*   **Housing:** A sealed, transparent acrylic or glass enclosure. Dimensions variable, suggested starting point: 20cm x 20cm x 5cm.  Mounting points integrated into the rear.
*   **Gel Matrix:** A non-toxic, nutrient-rich hydrogel (alginate or similar) designed to sustain *Vibrio fischeri* or engineered bioluminescent bacteria.  Must allow for gas exchange (oxygen/CO2) and nutrient delivery.
*   **Bacterial Culture:** Genetically modified *Vibrio fischeri* bacteria engineered to respond to external stimuli.  Possible response mechanisms:
    *   **Sound:**  Bacterial lux operon activated by sound vibrations – louder sounds = brighter light.
    *   **Touch:**  Pressure-sensitive proteins trigger light emission upon physical contact.
    *   **Air Quality:**  Biosensors detect VOCs (volatile organic compounds) – increased VOCs = increased light (acts as an air quality indicator).
*   **Microfluidic System:**  A miniature, integrated microfluidic network within the gel matrix to deliver nutrients and remove waste products.  This extends the lifespan of the bacteria. Includes a small reservoir and peristaltic pump (solar powered, or low voltage).
*   **Sensor Array:** Micro-sensors integrated into the housing to detect external stimuli (sound, touch, air quality). These sensors send signals to the microfluidic pump.
*   **Diffuser Layer:** A thin, textured layer on the interior surface of the housing to diffuse the light evenly.
*   **Power Supply:** Solar-powered, or low-voltage AC adapter.

**Operation:**

1.  The bacterial culture is suspended within the nutrient-rich gel matrix inside the transparent housing.
2.  External stimuli (sound, touch, air quality) are detected by the sensor array.
3.  The sensor array signals the microfluidic pump to deliver additional nutrients to the bacteria (or flush out waste).
4.  The increased nutrient delivery (or waste removal) alters the metabolic rate of the bacteria, causing changes in bioluminescence intensity.
5.  The bioluminescent light is diffused by the diffuser layer, creating a soft, ambient glow.

**Pseudocode (Stimulus Response):**

```
// Define stimulus thresholds
SOUND_THRESHOLD = 60 dB
TOUCH_THRESHOLD = 0.5 N
VOC_THRESHOLD = 50 ppb

// Function to process stimuli
function processStimuli(soundLevel, touchPressure, vocLevel) {
  if (soundLevel > SOUND_THRESHOLD) {
    increaseNutrientFlowRate(SOUND_FLOW_RATE);
  } else {
    setNutrientFlowRate(BASE_FLOW_RATE);
  }

  if (touchPressure > TOUCH_THRESHOLD) {
    increaseNutrientFlowRate(TOUCH_FLOW_RATE);
    delay(2 seconds); // brief burst of light
  } else {
    setNutrientFlowRate(BASE_FLOW_RATE);
  }

  if (vocLevel > VOC_THRESHOLD) {
    increaseNutrientFlowRate(VOC_FLOW_RATE);
  } else {
    setNutrientFlowRate(BASE_FLOW_RATE);
  }
}

// Main loop
while (true) {
  soundLevel = readSoundSensor();
  touchPressure = readTouchSensor();
  vocLevel = readVocSensor();

  processStimuli(soundLevel, touchPressure, vocLevel);

  delay(100 milliseconds);
}
```

**Variations:**

*   **Color Control:** Engineer bacteria to produce different colored bioluminescence.
*   **Pattern Generation:** Utilize microfluidic channels to create dynamic patterns within the gel matrix.
*   **Remote Control:** Integrate a wireless control system to adjust the sensitivity of the sensors.
*   **Modular Design:** Create a modular system that allows users to customize the size, shape, and functionality of the wall light.
