## Adaptive Verification Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the bit-reduction granularity during memory verification based on real-time data dependency analysis. The existing patent focuses on reducing bits communicated *during* verification. This expands that by *analyzing* what bits are actually *needed* for meaningful verification at each step, and adapting the reduction accordingly.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Dedicated data dependency analysis module integrated into the verification environment. Requires access to the circuit design netlist, and the verification stimulus/response data.
*   **Software:** Verification environment extension. This extension receives the stimulus and expected response, and interfaces with the data dependency analysis module.
*   **Data Dependency Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Circuit netlist, current stimulus, expected response, current verification cycle data.
    *   Process:
        1.  Trace data flow from memory output to all points of use within the circuit logic being verified.
        2.  Identify which bits of the memory output are actually used in subsequent calculations or comparisons.
        3.  Calculate a "dependency score" for each bit. (Higher score = more critical, more bits retained.)
        4.  Dynamically adjust the bit-reduction level for each memory access.  Bits with low dependency scores are aggressively reduced/eliminated.
*   **Bit-Reduction Implementation:** Utilize a bit-masking system. Based on the dependency scores, a bit mask is generated and applied to the memory output before it's used in the verification logic.
*   **Granularity Levels:** Support multiple levels of bit-reduction granularity (e.g., bit-level, byte-level, word-level). The dependency analysis module determines the optimal granularity for each memory access.
*   **Verification Metric:** Track "coverage" of data dependencies. The goal is to ensure that all critical data dependencies are verified with sufficient bit-width.

**Pseudocode (Verification Environment Extension):**

```
function verify_memory_access(address, data, expected_data):
  dependency_scores = analyze_data_dependencies(address, data)
  bit_mask = generate_bit_mask(dependency_scores)
  masked_data = apply_bit_mask(data, bit_mask)
  
  if masked_data == expected_data:
    return PASS
  else:
    return FAIL

function analyze_data_dependencies(address, data):
  // Trace data flow from memory output to all points of use.
  // Calculate dependency scores for each bit.
  // Return array of dependency scores (e.g., [0.9, 0.2, 0.7, 0.1...])

function generate_bit_mask(dependency_scores):
  // Convert dependency scores into a bit mask.
  // High dependency = 1, low dependency = 0
  // Return bit mask (e.g., 0b10110010...)

function apply_bit_mask(data, bit_mask):
  // Apply the bit mask to the data.
  // Return masked data.
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Verification Time:** By minimizing the amount of data processed, verification can be significantly faster.
*   **Increased Verification Coverage:** Focuses verification efforts on the most critical data paths.
*   **Improved Accuracy:** Minimizes the risk of false positives due to irrelevant data.
*   **Adaptive Verification:** Can adjust to changes in the circuit design or verification stimulus.
