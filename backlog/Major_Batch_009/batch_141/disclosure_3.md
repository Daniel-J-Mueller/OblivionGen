## Dynamic Access Question Generation via Environmental Analysis

**Concept:** Augment the access question generation with real-time environmental data to create dynamically changing, context-aware security checks. Instead of pre-defined questions, the system analyzes the surroundings and formulates questions based on observed features.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate a multi-sensor module near the access point:
    *   **Visual Sensor (Camera):** High-resolution camera for object detection, scene analysis (lighting, color, shapes).
    *   **Audio Sensor (Microphone Array):**  Directional audio analysis to identify ambient sounds (traffic, voices, specific noises).
    *   **Environmental Sensor:** Temperature, humidity, air quality readings.
    *   **Proximity Sensor:**  Detects presence and distance of objects/people.

*   **AI Core – Environmental Analyzer:**
    *   **Object Recognition:**  Identify objects within the camera’s field of view (cars, trees, signs, people).
    *   **Sound Event Detection:** Recognize specific sounds and categorize them.
    *   **Scene Understanding:** Analyze the overall environment based on visual and audio data (e.g., "busy street," "quiet garden," "construction site").

*   **AI Core – Question Generator:**
    *   **Knowledge Base:**  A database linking environmental features to potential questions. Example:
        *   "If 'red car' is detected, question: 'What is the last digit of the license plate?'"
        *   "If 'birdsong' is detected, question: 'What type of bird is most common in this area?'"
        *   "If 'temperature > 30C', question: 'What is the current heat index?'"
        *   "If 'construction noise', question: 'What is the name of the construction company?'"
    *   **Dynamic Question Selection:**  Prioritize questions based on confidence levels of environmental analysis and potential for unique/difficult answers. 
    *   **Question Complexity Adjustment:** System automatically adjusts question difficulty by varying information required or introducing ambiguity. 

*   **System Workflow:**
    1.  User requests access.
    2.  Sensor Suite gathers environmental data.
    3.  AI Core - Environmental Analyzer processes data and identifies key features.
    4.  AI Core - Question Generator selects a relevant question based on identified features.
    5.  System generates audio output of the question.
    6.  User responds.
    7.  System analyzes the response (keyword spotting, speech-to-text).
    8.  If correct, grant access.

**Pseudocode (Question Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateAccessQuestion(environmentalData)

    // Extract features from environmentalData
    features = ExtractFeatures(environmentalData)

    // Retrieve potential questions from Knowledge Base based on features
    potentialQuestions = KnowledgeBase.GetQuestions(features)

    // Score questions based on confidence levels of feature detection
    scoredQuestions = ScoreQuestions(potentialQuestions, featureConfidence)

    // Select the highest-scoring question
    selectedQuestion = SelectQuestion(scoredQuestions)

    RETURN selectedQuestion
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Gamification:** Incorporate elements of a puzzle or riddle into the question.
*   **Personalization:** Tailor questions based on user history or preferences.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Combine environmental questions with other authentication methods (biometrics, PINs).
*   **Adaptive Difficulty:** System dynamically adjusts question difficulty based on user performance.
