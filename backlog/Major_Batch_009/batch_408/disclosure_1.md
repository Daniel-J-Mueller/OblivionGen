## Dynamic Noise Profiling with Spatial Awareness

**Concept:** Extend the noise thresholding system to incorporate data from geographically distributed nodes, creating a real-time, localized noise map. This moves beyond channel-specific thresholds to a spatially aware noise floor, enabling more robust communication in crowded RF environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Node Requirements:** Each node in the network must have:
    *   GPS/Location Services.
    *   RF Signal Strength Measurement (RSSI, or equivalent).
    *   Communication Module (to share noise data with a central server/coordinator).
    *   Processing Unit capable of running the noise profiling algorithm.
*   **Data Collection:**
    *   Nodes continuously measure RSSI across all channels *even when not actively transmitting/receiving*.
    *   Nodes timestamp RSSI readings with accurate location data.
    *   Data is transmitted to a central server/coordinator with a configurable frequency. (e.g., every 5 seconds, or based on signal change thresholds).
*   **Noise Map Generation (Server/Coordinator):**
    *   The server maintains a grid-based noise map representing the RF environment.
    *   Received RSSI data is mapped onto the grid based on node location.
    *   Data is aggregated and smoothed using a moving average or similar algorithm to create a localized noise floor estimate for each grid cell.
    *   Consider using a Kalman filter to predict future noise levels and compensate for temporary fluctuations.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (Nodes):**
    *   Before initiating a frequency hop sequence, a node queries the server for the localized noise floor estimate for its current location.
    *   The node adjusts its signal threshold based on the received noise floor estimate.
    *   The threshold adjustment should be dynamic. For instance: `Threshold = NoiseFloor + SensitivityMargin`. (Sensitivity margin configurable per application).
*   **Adaptive Learning:**
    *   Implement a feedback loop. If a node consistently fails to establish a connection on a particular channel, increase the noise floor estimate for that location.
    *   Utilize machine learning techniques (e.g., regression) to predict noise levels based on historical data, time of day, location, and other relevant factors.

**Pseudocode (Node - Frequency Hop Initiation):**

```
function initiateFrequencyHop(targetChannel):
    location = getCurrentLocation()
    noiseFloor = requestNoiseFloor(location) // Query central server
    sensitivityMargin = getConfigParameter("SensitivityMargin")
    signalThreshold = noiseFloor + sensitivityMargin

    // Initiate frequency hop to targetChannel
    // Set signal threshold to signalThreshold
    // Monitor RSSI on targetChannel and determine lock-on based on threshold

```

**Pseudocode (Server - Noise Map Update):**

```
function updateNoiseMap(nodeLocation, channel, rssi):
    gridCell = findGridCell(nodeLocation)
    gridCell.rssiData.append((timestamp, rssi))

    // Apply smoothing algorithm (e.g., moving average) to gridCell.rssiData
    gridCell.noiseFloor = calculateNoiseFloor(gridCell.rssiData)

    return gridCell.noiseFloor
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved communication reliability in dense RF environments.
*   Reduced interference and false positives.
*   Adaptability to changing RF conditions.
*   Scalability through distributed data collection.
