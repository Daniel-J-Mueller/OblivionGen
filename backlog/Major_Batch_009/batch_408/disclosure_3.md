## Biofeedback-Integrated Temple Pressure Mapping

**Concept:** Expand the force sensing beyond simple ‘on/off’ detection to create a detailed pressure map of the temples, integrated with biofeedback data to dynamically adjust audio or haptic output based on user stress/cognitive load.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Replace individual FSRs with a flexible, high-resolution array of capacitive pressure sensors embedded within the temple pads. Minimum resolution: 16x16 sensors per temple. Sensor range: 0-500g.
*   **Biofeedback Sensors:** Integrate PPG (photoplethysmography) and GSR (galvanic skin response) sensors into the temple pads, contacting the skin directly. Sampling rate: PPG - 50Hz, GSR - 4Hz.
*   **Microcontroller:** Low-power ARM Cortex-M4 processor with integrated ADC for sensor data acquisition.
*   **Wireless Communication:** Bluetooth 5.0 for data transmission to a host device (smartphone, computer).
*   **Power:** Rechargeable lithium-polymer battery (minimum 100mAh) with USB-C charging.
*   **Temple Pad Material:** Medical-grade silicone with integrated sensor array and biofeedback sensors. Replaceable/washable.

**Software Specifications (Pseudocode):**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
Initialize sensor array, PPG, GSR, Bluetooth
Establish Bluetooth connection

// Main Loop
While (Bluetooth connected)
    // Read Sensor Data
    pressureMap = ReadPressureMap() // Returns 16x16 array of pressure values
    ppgValue = ReadPPG()
    gsrValue = ReadGSR()

    // Data Processing
    averagePressure = CalculateAverage(pressureMap)
    stressLevel = CalculateStress(ppgValue, gsrValue) // Algorithm to estimate stress from biofeedback data

    // Dynamic Adjustment
    IF (stressLevel > threshold) THEN
        // Reduce audio volume or switch to calming audio track
        AdjustAudio(volume = volume * 0.5, track = "calming")
        // Activate haptic feedback pattern (e.g., slow, rhythmic pulses)
        ActivateHaptic(pattern = "slow_pulse")
    ELSE IF (averagePressure > pressureThreshold) THEN
        //Indicate device is slipping/not properly positioned
        TriggerVisualCue() // e.g. a subtle LED flash
    ELSE
        // Maintain normal audio/haptic settings
        AdjustAudio(volume = defaultVolume, track = currentTrack)
        DeactivateHaptic()
    ENDIF

    //Transmit data to host for logging/visualization
    TransmitData(pressureMap, ppgValue, gsrValue, stressLevel)

    Delay(10ms)
END
```

**Novelty:**  Combines high-resolution pressure mapping with real-time biofeedback to create a truly adaptive and personalized experience.  The device isn’t just detecting if it’s worn or not; it's monitoring the user’s physiological state and adjusting its output to promote comfort, focus, or relaxation.  Potential applications beyond audio/haptic control include cognitive load monitoring for gaming, stress management tools, and accessibility features for individuals with sensory sensitivities. The inclusion of localized pressure mapping allows for precise fit detection and notification.
