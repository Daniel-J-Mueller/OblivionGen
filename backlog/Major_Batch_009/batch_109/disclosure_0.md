## Adaptive Key Sharding with Behavioral Drift Detection

**Concept:** Extend the policy enforcement described in the patent by dynamically sharding cryptographic keys based on observed usage patterns and proactively rotating shards exhibiting anomalous behavior. This shifts from reactive blocking to predictive mitigation.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Key Shard Manager (KSM):** Central component responsible for key sharding, rotation, and policy enforcement. Operates as a microservice.
*   **Usage Monitoring Agent (UMA):** Deployed alongside data-generating applications. Collects metadata about cryptographic operations (timestamp, data type, user, source/destination IP, data size, API call). Transmits metadata to the KSM.
*   **Behavioral Drift Detector (BDD):**  A machine learning model within the KSM. Trained on historical usage data to establish baseline behavior for each key shard. Identifies deviations from the baseline.
*   **Cryptographic Service:** Provides core cryptographic functions (encryption/decryption).  Interfaces with the KSM to obtain appropriate key shards.
*   **Attestation Service:** Verifies the integrity of the UMA and Cryptographic Service.  Ensures data authenticity and prevents tampering.

**2. Key Sharding Strategy:**

*   **Initial Sharding:**  A master key is initially sharded into N segments using a secret sharing scheme (e.g., Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing). Each segment constitutes a key shard.
*   **Dynamic Assignment:** Key shards are dynamically assigned to applications/services based on observed usage patterns.  The KSM maintains a mapping of shards to applications.
*   **Granularity:** Sharding granularity can be adjusted based on security requirements and performance constraints. (e.g. per-user, per-application, per-data-type).

**3. Behavioral Drift Detection:**

*   **Feature Extraction:** The BDD extracts features from the usage metadata collected by the UMAs.  Example features:
    *   Request rate per shard
    *   Data volume encrypted per shard
    *   Unique users accessing each shard
    *   Time of day distribution of requests
    *   Source IP address distribution
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  The BDD employs anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify deviations from the baseline behavior of each shard.
*   **Thresholds:**  Anomaly scores exceeding a predefined threshold trigger a rotation event.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Thresholds are dynamically adjusted based on historical performance and evolving threat landscape.

**4. Key Rotation & Mitigation:**

*   **Proactive Rotation:** When anomalous behavior is detected in a shard, the KSM initiates a key rotation.
*   **Rotation Process:**
    1.  A new shard is generated.
    2.  The new shard is distributed to authorized applications.
    3.  The old shard is revoked.
    4.  Data encrypted with the old shard remains accessible through a key escrow service.
*   **Escrow Service:** Securely stores revoked shards for a predefined period, enabling decryption of legacy data.
*   **Mitigation Actions:**  Alongside key rotation, the KSM can trigger other mitigation actions, such as:
    *   Rate limiting requests to the affected application
    *   Blocking traffic from suspicious IP addresses
    *   Alerting security personnel

**5. Pseudocode (Key Rotation Workflow):**

```pseudocode
function RotateKeyShard(shardID) {
  // Generate new key shard
  newShard = GenerateKeyShard()

  // Distribute new shard to authorized applications
  DistributeKeyShard(newShard, shardID)

  // Revoke old shard
  RevokeKeyShard(shardID)

  // Store old shard in escrow
  StoreKeyShardInEscrow(shardID)

  // Update shard mapping
  UpdateShardMapping(shardID, newShard)
}

function DetectBehavioralDrift(shardID, usageMetadata) {
  // Extract features from usageMetadata
  features = ExtractFeatures(usageMetadata)

  // Calculate anomaly score using BDD model
  anomalyScore = BDDModel.predict(features)

  // Check if anomaly score exceeds threshold
  if (anomalyScore > Threshold) {
    RotateKeyShard(shardID)
  }
}
```

**6. Security Considerations:**

*   **Secure Key Generation & Storage:** Employ robust key generation algorithms and hardware security modules (HSMs) to protect key material.
*   **Secure Communication:**  Use TLS/SSL to encrypt communication between system components.
*   **Tamper Detection:**  Implement mechanisms to detect tampering with the KSM, UMA, and Cryptographic Service.
*   **Auditing:**  Log all key rotations and security events for auditing purposes.
