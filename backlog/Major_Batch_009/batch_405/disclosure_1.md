## Adaptive Payload Injection for Network Topology Discovery

**Concept:** Extend the probe packet methodology to dynamically inject and interpret application-level payloads *within* the probe itself, allowing for real-time service discovery and topology mapping beyond simple latency/loss metrics.

**Specs:**

**1. Probe Packet Structure:**

*   **Base Header Stack:** (As described in patent - UDP/IP stack for routing).
*   **Payload Header:** 2-byte field indicating payload type (e.g., DNS query, HTTP GET, ICMP echo request, custom application protocol).
*   **Payload Data:** Variable length, containing the application-level request.
*   **Response Flag:** 1-bit flag indicating whether a response is expected.
*   **TTL/Hop Limit:** Standard IP TTL, but also a probe-specific hop limit to control maximum depth of discovery.

**2. Network Node Behavior (Probe Receiver):**

*   **Payload Inspection:** Upon receiving a probe packet, extract the Payload Type.
*   **Service Mapping:** Based on the Payload Type, attempt to fulfill the request (e.g., resolve DNS name, respond to HTTP GET).  If unable to fulfill, log the failure (service not available).
*   **Response Generation:** If Response Flag is set, generate a standard application-level response, embedding:
    *   Timestamp (arrival & processing time).
    *   Node ID (unique identifier).
    *   Service Type (e.g., DNS, HTTP, database).
    *   Any relevant service parameters (e.g., database version).
*   **Encapsulation & Forwarding:** Encapsulate the response within a UDP packet and send it back to the probe sender (or a designated probe receiver).

**3. Probe Sender Logic:**

*   **Payload Generation:** Create a series of probe packets with different Payload Types targeting various potential services.
*   **Target List:** Maintain a list of potential services to discover.
*   **Packet Sequencing:** Number probe packets sequentially to facilitate ordering of responses.
*   **Response Aggregation:** Collect responses from network nodes.
*   **Topology Mapping:**  Use received responses to build a dynamic map of network topology, identifying available services, their locations, and interconnectivity.  The map should track:
    *   Node IDs and locations.
    *   Service types offered by each node.
    *   Latency and bandwidth between nodes.
*   **Adaptive Probing:** Dynamically adjust the probing strategy based on the discovered topology. For example:
    *   Increase probe density in areas with high service concentration.
    *   Prioritize probing of newly discovered nodes.
    *   Reduce probing of unresponsive nodes.

**Pseudocode (Probe Sender - Simplified):**

```
initialize topology_map = empty
initialize target_list = [DNS, HTTP, Database, SSH]

for service in target_list:
    for i in range(probe_count):
        create probe_packet(service, i)
        send probe_packet
    
while responses received:
    process_response(response)
    update_topology_map(response)
    adjust_probing_strategy(topology_map)
```

**Novelty:**  This extends the passive monitoring of the original patent to *active* service discovery. The probes aren’t just measuring network characteristics; they’re actively eliciting information about the services running on the network, creating a dynamic inventory. It’s akin to an active network scan, but performed using lightweight, controlled probe packets, minimizing disruption.
