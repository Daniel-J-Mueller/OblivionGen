## Personalized Proactive Communication Suggestions

**Concept:** Expand beyond reactive communication initiation (responding to a user’s direct request) to *proactively* suggest communication options based on learned patterns, calendar data, and contextual cues, *before* the user explicitly asks. This builds on the existing entity resolution and historical data aspects of the patent.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Integration & Analysis Module:**

*   **Inputs:**
    *   User Profile (from existing system)
    *   Communication History (from existing system)
    *   Calendar Data (access to user's calendar with permission)
    *   Location Data (optional, with user permission)
    *   Activity Data (e.g., recent app usage, web browsing – with explicit user opt-in and privacy controls)
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Pattern Identification:** Analyze historical communication data to identify frequently contacted individuals at specific times, locations, or in relation to specific events (e.g., “Every Monday at 9am, user calls John”).
    *   **Event Correlation:** Correlate calendar events with potential communication needs (e.g., “Meeting scheduled with Jane tomorrow; suggest sending a pre-meeting reminder”).
    *   **Contextual Analysis:** Utilize activity data to infer communication needs (e.g., “User recently viewed a restaurant menu; suggest asking a friend if they want to go”).
    *   **Scoring Algorithm:** Assign a “communication propensity score” to each potential contact based on the above factors. Higher scores indicate a greater likelihood of initiating communication.
*   **Output:**  List of potential contacts with associated communication propensity scores.

**2. Proactive Suggestion Engine:**

*   **Trigger:** Runs continuously in the background, or on specific events (e.g., user unlocking device, calendar event approaching).
*   **Filtering:**  Filters the list of potential contacts based on user-defined preferences (e.g., exclude certain individuals, prioritize specific communication methods).
*   **Presentation:**
    *   **Non-Intrusive Notification:** Display suggestions as subtle notifications or within a dedicated communication hub.
    *   **Contextual Information:** Include information explaining *why* a particular contact is being suggested (e.g., “Suggest calling John – you usually connect on Mondays”).
    *   **Quick Actions:** Provide one-tap actions to initiate communication (e.g., “Call”, “Text”, “Email”).
*   **Learning & Adaptation:** Continuously learn from user interactions to improve suggestion accuracy.  A reinforcement learning model could be employed to maximize user engagement with suggestions.

**3. Privacy & Control Mechanisms:**

*   **Explicit Opt-In:** Users must explicitly opt-in to enable proactive communication suggestions.
*   **Data Transparency:** Users have access to the data used to generate suggestions.
*   **Granular Control:** Users can customize the types of data used, the frequency of suggestions, and the individuals included.
*   **Data Minimization:** Only collect and store the minimum amount of data necessary.
*   **Differential Privacy:** Employ differential privacy techniques to protect user privacy.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main loop
While (userEnabled) {
  contacts = analyzeData(userProfile, communicationHistory, calendarData, activityData)
  filteredContacts = filterContacts(contacts, userPreferences)
  if (filteredContacts.length > 0) {
    displaySuggestion(filteredContacts[0]) // Suggest the top contact
  }
  updateModel(userInteraction) // Reinforcement learning
  sleep(60 seconds) // Check for updates every minute
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Automated Action Suggestions:**  Beyond simply suggesting communication, proactively suggest actions (e.g., “Suggest sharing this article with John”).
*   **Multi-Modal Suggestions:**  Provide suggestions across multiple communication channels (e.g., voice, text, video).
*   **Integration with Smart Home Devices:**  Suggest communication based on smart home events (e.g., “Motion detected at home – suggest calling family”).
*   **AI-Powered Message Generation:**  Pre-populate messages with relevant content based on context.
