## Adaptive Data Shadowing with Predictive Mutation

**Concept:** Extend the global sequence number (GSN) concept to not only detect mutations but *predict* them based on transaction patterns and data access frequencies. Create a tiered “shadow” of the primary data, with layers reflecting increasing probabilities of mutation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Tiering & Shadow Creation:**

*   **Tier 0 (Immediate Shadow):**  A complete, synchronized copy of the primary data (as in the provided patent).  GSN matched perfectly. Lowest latency access.
*   **Tier 1 (High Probability Shadow):** Data sections identified as frequently modified based on historical transaction logs and real-time access patterns.  A probabilistic data structure (Bloom Filter, HyperLogLog) tracks likely mutation candidates.  GSN may lag slightly. Medium latency.
*   **Tier 2 (Medium Probability Shadow):**  Data sections with moderate modification frequency.  Updates are batched and applied with lower priority.  GSN lag is more significant. Higher latency.
*   **Tier 3 (Low Probability Shadow):**  Static or rarely changing data. Minimal synchronization. Highest latency.  Primarily accessed for read-only operations.

**2. Predictive Mutation Engine:**

*   **Transaction Log Analysis:** Continuously analyze transaction logs to identify patterns in data modifications. Machine learning models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks) predict which data sections are likely to be modified in the near future.
*   **Access Frequency Monitoring:** Track data access patterns. Data sections accessed frequently are more likely to be modified.
*   **Risk Score Assignment:**  Assign a "mutation risk score" to each data section based on transaction history, access frequency, and machine learning predictions. This score dictates the tier assignment.
*   **Dynamic Tier Adjustment:**  The mutation risk score is continuously updated, and data sections are dynamically moved between tiers as their probability of mutation changes.

**3.  GSN Propagation & Reconciliation:**

*   **Tier-Specific GSNs:**  Each tier maintains its own GSN, reflecting the mutation state of the data it holds.
*   **GSN Propagation:** The primary data’s GSN is propagated to all tiers.  Each tier can then compare its GSN to the primary GSN to identify discrepancies.
*   **Selective Reconciliation:**  Instead of reconciling the entire data set, reconciliation is performed selectively on the tiers with mismatched GSNs.  The degree of reconciliation is proportional to the GSN difference.
*   **Conflict Resolution:**  Conflict resolution algorithms (e.g., last-writer-wins, timestamp-based merging) handle conflicting updates.

**4. Implementation Pseudocode (Simplified)**

```
// Primary Data Store
GSN = 0

// Shadow Tier (Tier 1)
Tier1_GSN = 0
Data_Tier1 = []

function process_transaction(transaction) {
  // Update Primary Data
  update_primary_data(transaction)
  GSN++

  // Propagate GSN to Tier 1
  send_GSN(Tier1_GSN, GSN)

  // If Tier1_GSN < GSN, trigger reconciliation
  if (Tier1_GSN < GSN) {
    reconcile_data(Tier1_Data, Primary_Data, Tier1_GSN, GSN)
    Tier1_GSN = GSN
  }
}

function reconcile_data(Tier_Data, Primary_Data, Tier_GSN, Primary_GSN) {
  // Identify changed records based on GSN difference
  changed_records = get_changed_records(Primary_GSN, Tier_GSN)
  
  // Apply changes to Tier Data
  for (record in changed_records) {
    Tier_Data[record] = Primary_Data[record]
  }
}

function predict_mutations() {
  // Analyze transaction logs
  // Apply machine learning models
  // Calculate mutation risk scores
  // Adjust tier assignments based on scores
}

// Background thread:
while (true) {
  predict_mutations()
  sleep(60 seconds)
}
```

**5.  Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-speed network interconnects between the primary data store and the shadow tiers.
*   SSD or NVMe storage for all tiers to minimize latency.
*   Sufficient memory to cache frequently accessed data.
*   Dedicated processing cores for the predictive mutation engine.
