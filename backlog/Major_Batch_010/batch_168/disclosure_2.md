## Adaptive Predictive Framing

**Concept:** Augment the existing camera system with predictive framing based on learned user behavior and environmental context. This goes beyond simple motion detection – the system *anticipates* areas of interest and proactively adjusts the camera’s focus and framing *before* motion occurs.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Existing Camera (as per patent)
    *   Microphone Array: For audio event detection (footsteps, voices, breaking glass).
    *   Passive Infrared (PIR) Sensor: For preliminary motion heat signature detection, independent of visual confirmation.
    *   Optional: Low-resolution depth sensor (time-of-flight or structured light) for basic scene understanding.
*   **Data Processing Unit:** Dedicated processor (potentially a neural processing unit) for real-time analysis of sensor data.
*   **Memory:**  High-bandwidth memory for storing learned behavior patterns, environmental models, and sensor data.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Behavioral Learning Module:*  Tracks user movement patterns within the camera’s field of view. This includes common paths, frequently visited areas, and typical activity times. Uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict future movements.
    *   *Environmental Modeling Module:*  Builds a map of the environment, identifying static objects (furniture, walls) and dynamic elements (doors, windows). Uses computer vision techniques (SLAM - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).
    *   *Predictive Framing Engine:* Combines outputs from the Behavioral Learning and Environmental Modeling modules to predict areas of interest. This module dynamically adjusts camera focus, zoom, and pan to pre-frame these areas.
    *   *Contextual Awareness Engine:* Integrates data from all sensors to refine predictions. For example, audio cues (a dog barking) combined with a learned behavior (owner returning home) can trigger pre-framing of the entrance.
*   **Communication Interface:**  Wireless communication (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) for remote control and data transmission.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Framing Engine):**

```
// Input: User Behavior Data (RNN output), Environmental Map, Sensor Data (PIR, Microphone)
// Output: Camera Control Signals (Pan, Tilt, Zoom)

function predictFraming():
  behaviorPrediction = BehavioralLearningModule.predictNextLocation()
  environmentalContext = EnvironmentalModelingModule.getRelevantObjects(behaviorPrediction)
  sensorInput = SensorData.process()

  // Calculate weighted probability of different areas being of interest
  areaProbability = calculateProbability(behaviorPrediction, environmentalContext, sensorInput)

  // Identify the area with the highest probability
  targetArea = findMaxProbabilityArea(areaProbability)

  // Calculate camera control signals to frame the target area
  panAngle, tiltAngle, zoomLevel = calculateCameraControls(targetArea)

  // Send camera control signals
  Camera.setControls(panAngle, tiltAngle, zoomLevel)

  return panAngle, tiltAngle, zoomLevel
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond reactive motion detection to *proactive* framing, anticipating user activity and adjusting the camera accordingly. This enhances the quality of captured footage, reduces the risk of missing important events, and provides a more intuitive and seamless user experience. The fusion of behavioral learning, environmental modeling, and multi-sensor input creates a sophisticated system capable of adapting to dynamic environments and user habits.
