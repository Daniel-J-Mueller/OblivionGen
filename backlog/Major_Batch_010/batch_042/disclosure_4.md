## Spectral Decomposition for Predictive Display Failure

**Concept:** Expand the scanned image analysis to include detailed spectral decomposition, creating a ‘spectral fingerprint’ for each display, and utilizing machine learning to *predict* potential failure modes *before* they manifest as visible defects.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware:**

*   **Modified Scanner:** A standard flatbed scanner base, augmented with:
    *   **Tunable Light Source:**  A broadband light source (LED array) capable of emitting light across the visible and near-infrared spectrum (400nm – 1000nm) with programmable intensity at narrow bandwidths.  Control via software interface.
    *   **Spectrometer Integration:** A miniature spectrometer (high resolution, <5nm bandwidth) integrated into the scanner's read head to analyze reflected light. The spectrometer should be positioned to capture a representative sample of the light reflected from each scanned pixel.
    *   **Polarization Filter Array:** An array of linear polarization filters mounted before the spectrometer, allowing measurement of light polarization at various angles.
*   **Precision Stage:** A high-resolution, computer-controlled XYZ stage to enable accurate scanning and positioning of the display being tested.

**2. Software & Algorithms:**

*   **Spectral Data Acquisition:** Software to control the tunable light source, spectrometer, and precision stage.  The software must facilitate automated spectral scans of the entire display surface.  Acquire spectral data (intensity vs. wavelength) for each pixel.  Acquire polarized spectral data for each pixel.
*   **Spectral Fingerprint Generation:**  Algorithm to create a unique ‘spectral fingerprint’ for each display. This fingerprint should represent the display’s characteristic spectral reflectance profile across the scanned wavelengths and polarization angles.  Employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or similar dimensionality reduction techniques to compress the spectral data into a manageable feature vector.
*   **Failure Mode Database:** A database storing spectral fingerprints of known ‘good’ displays, as well as displays exhibiting various failure modes (e.g., dead pixels, color shift, burn-in, delamination).  Failure modes should be cataloged with corresponding spectral characteristics.
*   **Predictive Failure Algorithm:**  A machine learning model (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Neural Network) trained on the failure mode database.  The model takes the spectral fingerprint of a new display as input and predicts the probability of each failure mode occurring in the future. Utilize time-series analysis of historical scans to identify subtle changes in spectral characteristics indicative of impending failure.
*   **Visualization Tool:** Software to visualize the spectral fingerprint, predicted failure modes, and areas of potential concern on the display surface. Highlight areas with high probability of failure.

**3. Operation:**

1.  Place the display to be tested on the scanner bed.
2.  The software controls the light source to illuminate the display with a series of narrow bandwidths across the scanned spectrum.
3.  The reflected light is analyzed by the spectrometer at each pixel, generating a spectral profile.
4.  The spectral profiles are processed to create a ‘spectral fingerprint’ for the display.
5.  The predictive failure algorithm compares the display’s fingerprint to the failure mode database.
6.  The software outputs a report indicating the probability of each failure mode occurring, and highlights areas of potential concern on the display surface.
7.  Periodic scans can be performed to track changes in the spectral fingerprint and refine the failure predictions.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Failure Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION PredictFailure(spectral_fingerprint, failure_mode_database)

  // Calculate similarity between input fingerprint and database fingerprints
  similarity_scores = CalculateSimilarity(spectral_fingerprint, failure_mode_database)

  // Determine the most likely failure modes based on similarity scores
  predicted_failure_modes = FindTopN(similarity_scores, N=3) // Return top 3 most likely modes

  // Calculate probability of each failure mode
  probabilities = CalculateProbabilities(predicted_failure_modes, similarity_scores)

  // Return the predicted failure modes and their probabilities
  RETURN probabilities
END FUNCTION
