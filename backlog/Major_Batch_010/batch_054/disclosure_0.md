**Pixel-Selective Backlight Modulation with Micro-Lens Arrays**

**Core Concept:** Integrate a micro-lens array *behind* the display panel, coupled with individually controllable micro-LEDs, to modulate the backlight *per pixel*. This creates a true emissive display without requiring full-color micro-LEDs for every pixel.

**Specs:**

*   **Display Panel:** Standard LCD or OLED panel serving as a modulating layer. Existing manufacturing processes largely remain intact.
*   **Micro-LED Array:**  Monochrome (e.g., blue) micro-LEDs arranged in a grid matching or exceeding the pixel density of the display panel. Density target: 5000 PPI. Each micro-LED controlled independently.
*   **Micro-Lens Array (MLA):**  Precisely engineered MLA placed between the micro-LED array and the display panel. MLA designed to collimate light from each micro-LED and direct it *only* to the corresponding pixel on the display panel. Lenslet pitch must match pixel pitch. Material: High-transparency polymer with anti-reflective coating.
*   **Backplane:**  Thin-film transistor (TFT) backplane integrated *behind* the micro-LED array. This backplane provides individual control signals for each micro-LED.  Material: Amorphous silicon or IGZO.
*   **Control System:**  High-speed image processing unit. Receives video input, decomposes it into grayscale components, and generates control signals for each micro-LED. PWM dimming for precise grayscale control.

**Operation:**

1.  Video input is received and processed.
2.  For each frame, the image is converted into a grayscale map.
3.  The control system adjusts the brightness of each micro-LED based on the corresponding grayscale value.
4.  Light from each micro-LED is collimated by the MLA and directed to its assigned pixel.
5.  The LCD/OLED panel modulates the light, creating the final image.

**Pseudocode (Control System):**

```
function update_display(frame_data):
  for each pixel in frame_data:
    grayscale_value = pixel.intensity  // 0-255
    pwm_duty_cycle = grayscale_value / 255
    send_pwm_signal(pixel.id, pwm_duty_cycle)
```

**Innovation & Refinements:**

*   **Color Generation:** Implement a patterned color filter array (CFA) *on top* of the display panel to create full-color images. The CFA arranges red, green, and blue filters in a repeating pattern.
*   **Dynamic MLA:**  Develop a dynamically adjustable MLA using micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). This allows for focusing and beam steering, improving image quality and viewing angles.
*   **Light Recycling:** Integrate a reflective layer *behind* the micro-LED array to capture and redirect unused light back towards the LEDs, increasing efficiency.
*   **Holographic MLA:** Explore using a digitally fabricated holographic MLA for even greater control over light distribution.
