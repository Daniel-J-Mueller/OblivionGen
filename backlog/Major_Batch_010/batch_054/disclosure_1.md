## Adaptive Proximity Alerting with Dynamic Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the notification system to not only alert users of nearby activity but to dynamically assess the ‘trustworthiness’ of sharing that activity based on historical data and user-defined parameters. This creates a localized, adaptive security network.

**System Specs:**

*   **Data Collection Module:**
    *   Each A/V device logs event metadata: Timestamp, location, video/audio snippet, event type (motion, sound, person detected), and initial classification (e.g., "possible person," "vehicle," "animal").
    *   User feedback mechanism: After each event, users can classify the event with tags ("suspicious," "normal," "neighbor," "delivery," etc.).
    *   Data is anonymized and aggregated locally (on the network device/server) and can be optionally shared with a central service for broader pattern recognition.
*   **Trust Scoring Engine:**
    *   Assigns a ‘Trust Score’ to each A/V device based on user feedback, event classification accuracy, and consistency of reporting.
    *   Higher scores indicate more reliable devices/users.
    *   Trust Score decays over time if the device/user becomes inactive.
    *   Factors impacting Trust Score:
        *   Positive User Confirmation: +5 points
        *   Negative User Confirmation (False Positive): -3 points
        *   Consistent Accurate Classification: +2 points (per event)
        *   Inactivity > 7 days: -1 point per day.
*   **Dynamic Proximity Radius:**
    *   Instead of a fixed notification distance, the system calculates a ‘Dynamic Proximity Radius’ based on:
        *   Trust Score of the originating A/V device. Lower trust scores result in smaller radii.
        *   Event Type: ‘Suspicious’ events trigger larger radii.
        *   Time of Day: Larger radii during nighttime hours.
        *   User-Defined Sensitivity: Allow users to customize the sensitivity of proximity alerts.
*   **Alert Prioritization:**
    *   Combine Proximity Radius and Trust Score to prioritize alerts. High Trust Score + Large Proximity Radius = High Priority.
    *   Low Priority alerts are delivered as background notifications, while High Priority alerts trigger more immediate attention (e.g., push notifications, email).
*   **Neighborhood Watch Integration:**
    *   Allow users to form ‘Neighborhood Watch’ groups with trusted neighbors.
    *   Members of a group can share alerts and collaborate on identifying potential threats.
    *   Group alerts can be escalated to local authorities if necessary.
*   **Pseudocode - Alert Calculation:**

```
function calculateAlertRadius(originatingDeviceTrustScore, eventType, timeOfDay, userSensitivity) {
  baseRadius = 50 meters; // Default radius

  // Adjust radius based on Trust Score
  radiusAdjustment = originatingDeviceTrustScore * 2; // Higher score = larger adjustment
  baseRadius += radiusAdjustment;

  // Adjust radius based on Event Type
  if (eventType == "suspicious") {
    baseRadius *= 1.5; // Increase radius for suspicious events
  }

  // Adjust radius based on Time of Day
  if (timeOfDay == "night") {
    baseRadius *= 1.2; // Increase radius at night
  }

  // Apply User Sensitivity
  baseRadius *= userSensitivity; // User can adjust overall sensitivity

  return baseRadius;
}

function prioritizeAlert(alertRadius, originatingDeviceTrustScore) {
  priorityScore = alertRadius * originatingDeviceTrustScore;
  if (priorityScore > 75) {
    return "High";
  } else if (priorityScore > 50) {
    return "Medium";
  } else {
    return "Low";
  }
}

```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing A/V devices with network connectivity.
*   Network device/server capable of running the Trust Scoring Engine.
*   Smartphone app for user interface and alert management.

**Potential Expansion:**

*   Integration with local law enforcement databases.
*   Machine learning algorithms to automatically identify suspicious activity.
*   Gamification elements to encourage user participation and reporting.
