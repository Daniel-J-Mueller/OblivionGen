## Dynamic Wardrobe Simulation & Predictive Styling

**Concept:** Expand the palette-based recommendation system to incorporate a dynamic, simulated user wardrobe and predictive styling based on external factors & user preferences. 

**Specs:**

*   **Wardrobe Data Acquisition:**
    *   User connects accounts from online retail platforms (Amazon, Nordstrom, etc.) OR manually uploads item images & metadata (color, category, style tags).
    *   System automatically tags/categorizes items using image recognition AI.
    *   User can edit/correct automatic tagging.
*   **Simulated Outfit Generation:**
    *   Algorithm generates potential outfits from the user’s wardrobe based on color palettes (derived from selected images *or* user-defined).
    *   Outfit ‘scoring’ based on:
        *   Color harmony (using principles from color theory).
        *   Style coherence (matching tags – e.g. ‘business casual’, ‘summer dress’).
        *   Layering appropriateness (seasonal considerations).
    *   Outfit visualization: Displays rendered images of outfit combinations (can use 3D modeling or stock photos to represent items).
*   **Contextual Prediction Engine:**
    *   Integrates external data feeds:
        *   Calendar integration: Upcoming events (meetings, dates, travel).
        *   Location services: Current weather, geographic location.
        *   Social media (optional): Trending styles, events near the user.
    *   Predicts outfit needs based on combined data. Example: "Meeting with client at 2 PM, temperature 25C, business casual recommended."
    *   Presents outfit suggestions ranked by appropriateness & user preference.
*   **Styling Preferences & Feedback Loop:**
    *   User explicitly rates outfit suggestions (“Like”, “Dislike”, “Save”).
    *   Machine learning algorithm learns user preferences over time.
    *   Fine-grained preference adjustments: User can specify preferences for specific colors, styles, brands, or occasions.
*   **‘Shop the Look’ Integration:**
    *   For missing items in a suggested outfit, provide links to purchase similar items from online retailers.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `Item`: {`itemID`, `imageURL`, `colorPalette`, `styleTags`, `category`, `brand`}
    *   `Outfit`: {`outfitID`, `items`, `score`}
    *   `Event`: {`eventID`, `datetime`, `location`, `description`, `styleGuidelines`}
*   **Pseudocode (Outfit Generation):**

```
function generateOutfit(event, wardrobe, palette) {
  potentialOutfits = []
  for each item in wardrobe {
    if item.colorPalette matches palette {
      outfit = createOutfit(item)
      if outfit.styleTags match event.styleGuidelines {
        outfit.score = calculateOutfitScore(outfit, event)
        potentialOutfits.add(outfit)
      }
    }
  }
  sort potentialOutfits by score descending
  return top N outfits
}

function calculateOutfitScore(outfit, event) {
  score = 0
  //Color harmony score
  score += colorHarmony(outfit.colorPalette) * 0.4
  //Style coherence score
  score += styleCoherence(outfit.styleTags, event.styleGuidelines) * 0.3
  //Weather appropriateness
  score += weatherAppropriateness(outfit.materials, current weather) * 0.3
  return score
}
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus primarily on recommending individual items based on color. This concept expands to simulate a full wardrobe, predict outfit needs based on contextual data, and learn user preferences over time, creating a personalized styling experience. It's less about finding a 'matching' item and more about proactively suggesting appropriate outfits.
