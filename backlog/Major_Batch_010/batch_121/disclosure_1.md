## Dynamic Data Provenance & Automated Remediation

**Concept:** Extend the modification listener system to not just *trigger* processing, but to automatically build a dynamic provenance graph *and* initiate automated remediation based on detected changes.

**Specifications:**

**1. Provenance Graph Construction:**

*   **Data Structure:** A directed graph where nodes represent data objects (files, blobs, etc.) and edges represent modifications. Edge attributes include:
    *   `timestamp`: When the modification occurred.
    *   `user`: The identity of the user initiating the change.
    *   `operation`: Type of modification (create, update, delete).
    *   `modification_listener`: Identifier of the listener that detected the change.
    *   `executable_code_triggered`: Identifier of code executed after the modification.
    *   `diff`: A snapshot of the change (e.g., using a diff algorithm).
*   **Listener Extension:** Modification listeners will *not only* trigger code but also emit provenance events. These events contain the data object identifier and modification details.
*   **Provenance Service:** A dedicated service receives provenance events and constructs/maintains the graph in a persistent store (e.g., a graph database).
*   **Graph Traversal API:** Provide an API to query the graph, allowing for analysis of data lineage, impact assessment, and audit trails.

**2. Automated Remediation Engine:**

*   **Policy Definition:** Allow administrators to define policies based on provenance graph patterns. Policies specify conditions (e.g., “If a critical file is modified by an unauthorized user”) and actions (e.g., “Roll back the change to the last known good version,” “Alert security team,” “Quarantine the affected data”).
*   **Policy Engine:** A component that monitors the provenance graph for policy violations.
*   **Remediation Actions:** A library of pre-built remediation actions (rollback, quarantine, alert, etc.).  Allow for custom action extensions.
*   **Action Orchestration:**  The policy engine orchestrates the execution of remediation actions based on detected violations.
*   **Audit Trail:** Log all remediation actions, including the triggering policy, the executed actions, and the outcome.

**Pseudocode (Policy Engine):**

```
function evaluatePolicy(provenanceEvent, policy) {
  graph = getProvenanceGraph();
  matches = graph.findPattern(policy.pattern); // Pattern matching on the graph
  if (matches != null) {
    for (match in matches) {
      context = match.context; // Data related to the match
      if (context.satisfies(policy.condition)) {
        for (action in policy.actions) {
          result = executeAction(action, context);
          logAction(action, context, result);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example Policy:**

```json
{
  "name": "Critical File Unauthorized Modification",
  "pattern": "Modification of file '/critical/data.txt'",
  "condition": "User is not in authorized user group",
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "rollback",
      "version": "latest"
    },
    {
      "type": "alert",
      "target": "security-team@example.com",
      "message": "Unauthorized modification of critical data detected."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Novelty:**  While modification listeners trigger actions, this extends that to *proactive* security and data integrity through dynamic provenance and automated remediation.  It moves beyond simple event-driven processing to a system capable of adapting to changes and mitigating risks automatically. It allows for a system which can not only react, but can detect attacks as they happen.
