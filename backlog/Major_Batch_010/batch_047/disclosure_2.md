## Dynamic Recourse Optimization with Predictive Behavioral Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the leftover demand prediction beyond simple historical data and incorporate predictive behavioral modeling of customer response to stockouts, dynamically adjusting ordering quantities based on projected shifts in demand *caused* by availability.  

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profile Database:**

*   **Data Inputs:**  Transaction history (purchase dates, quantities, item types), stockout notifications (opt-in), customer demographics (optional, anonymized), website/app browsing history (item views, cart additions/abandonments – with explicit consent).
*   **Modeling:** Employ machine learning algorithms (e.g., Markov chains, recurrent neural networks) to create individual/cohort-level behavioral profiles.  These profiles predict:
    *   *Stockout Tolerance:* Probability a customer will switch brands/products after a stockout.
    *   *Delayed Purchase Probability:* Probability a customer will purchase the item *later* if it's currently unavailable.  Time horizon: configurable (e.g., 1 week, 1 month).
    *   *Basket Substitution Rate:* Probability a customer will substitute another item in their basket if the original is unavailable.

**2. Dynamic Recourse Adjustment Module:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Standard Inputs (as per the provided patent): Historical leftover demand, current inventory, arrival data, demand distribution function, supply distribution function.
    *   Behavioral Profile Data:  Relevant profiles for items in the ordering queue.
    *   Real-Time Stockout Signals: Current stock levels across all facilities.
*   **Process:**
    1.  *Projected Demand Shift Calculation:*  For each item, estimate the impact of current and projected stockouts on future demand.  
        *   For customers identified as having low stockout tolerance, reduce projected demand.
        *   For customers identified as likely to delay purchase, increase projected future demand (shifted across planning horizons).
        *   Model basket substitution and adjust demand accordingly for related items.
    2.  *Optimized Ordering Quantity Calculation:* Modify the existing optimization model (Claim 2) to incorporate the “Projected Demand Shift”. The formula would be expanded to include a “Behavioral Adjustment Factor” (BAF) calculated from the behavioral profiles.  

        `min q { c_u [D_2 + α (D_1 - I_0) - q - (I_0 - D_1) + BAF] + c_0 [q + (I_0 - D_1) - D_2 - α (D_1 - I_0) + BAF] + }` 

        where: 
        *   BAF = Sum (customer_count * behavioral_adjustment) for all relevant customers/cohorts.  
        *   behavioral_adjustment = (projected increased demand due to delayed purchase) - (projected decreased demand due to switching brands).
    3.  *Recourse Policy Refinement:* Dynamically adjust the “α” parameter (estimate of leftover demand) based on the projected stockout impact.  Higher stockout risk = higher α (anticipate more unfulfilled demand).
    4.   *Order Allocation Logic:*  Optimize order allocation across facilities, prioritizing stock replenishment to locations with high stockout risk and significant behavioral impact.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Microservices:**  Implement as a set of independent microservices: Behavioral Profiling Service, Demand Prediction Service, Optimization Engine, Order Allocation Service.
*   **Data Pipeline:** Real-time data ingestion from transaction systems, website/app activity, and inventory management systems.
*   **API Integration:** Integrate with existing inventory management and ordering systems via REST APIs.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:**  Enable A/B testing to validate the effectiveness of the dynamic recourse adjustments and optimize model parameters.
