## Adaptive Application 'Bubbles' & Contextual Expansion

**Concept:** Instead of a carousel and full-screen expansion, introduce persistent, scalable 'application bubbles' that float on the display, representing active or frequently used applications. These bubbles dynamically adjust size and displayed information based on user proximity/gaze and application activity.

**Specs:**

*   **Bubble Creation:** When an application is launched (or after a period of inactivity, based on usage patterns), a circular ‘bubble’ is created. Initial size determined by application priority (user-defined or AI-learned).
*   **Bubble Persistence:** Bubbles remain visible even when the application is minimized or running in the background.
*   **Scalability:** Bubbles are scalable. Default size can be altered. Size dynamically adjusts based on several factors:
    *   **Proximity/Gaze:** If a user looks at or moves a finger near a bubble, it scales up, revealing more detailed information/controls.
    *   **Activity:** Bubble size grows with application activity (e.g., number of unread messages, download progress, active timers).
    *   **Priority:** User-defined priority influences baseline and maximum bubble size.
*   **Bubble Arrangement:** Bubbles avoid overlapping, employing a force-directed graph layout. The system intelligently distributes bubbles across the display, minimizing occlusion.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   **Tap:** Tapping a bubble brings the application to the foreground. A long-press reveals a context menu.
    *   **Swipe (on Bubble):** Swiping left/right on a bubble dismisses it or temporarily hides it.
    *   **Pinch/Zoom (on Bubble):** Allows direct manipulation of bubble size and displayed content.
*   **Content Display:** Bubbles can display various content:
    *   **Icon & App Name:** Basic identification.
    *   **Live Data:** Real-time updates (e.g., stock prices, weather conditions, message counts).
    *   **Miniature Previews:** Small previews of application content (e.g., email subjects, image thumbnails, video frames).
    *   **Interactive Controls:** Basic controls (e.g., play/pause, volume control, quick reply).
*   **AI-Driven Adaptation:**
    *   **Bubble Prioritization:** AI learns user application usage patterns to dynamically prioritize and position bubbles.
    *   **Content Selection:** AI intelligently selects the most relevant content to display within each bubble based on context and user behavior.
    *   **Bubble Clustering:** Bubbles can dynamically cluster together based on related functionality or user activity.

**Pseudocode (Bubble Scaling):**

```
function scaleBubble(bubble, proximity, activity, priority):
  baseSize = priority * scalingFactor
  proximitySize = proximity * proximityScalingFactor
  activitySize = activity * activityScalingFactor

  finalSize = baseSize + proximitySize + activitySize

  // Clamp finalSize to reasonable limits
  finalSize = max(minSize, min(maxSize, finalSize))

  bubble.setSize(finalSize)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-resolution display to support clear bubble rendering at various sizes.
*   Accurate proximity/gaze tracking sensor.
*   Sufficient processing power to handle dynamic bubble scaling and content rendering.
