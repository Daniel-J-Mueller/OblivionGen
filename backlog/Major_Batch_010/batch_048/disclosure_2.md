## Dynamic Social Shopping Profile Synthesis

**Concept:** Extend the community-based purchase notification system to actively *synthesize* a dynamic social shopping profile for each user, predicting future interests and proactively suggesting items *before* the user explicitly searches. This moves beyond reactive notifications to proactive curation, leveraging community data as a predictive engine.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Collect explicit purchase data (items bought, categories, price range).
    *   Collect implicit data (items viewed, time spent on item pages, items added to cart but not purchased).
    *   Community Data: Purchases & viewing habits of community members, weighted by similarity (see 'Similarity Metric' below).
    *   External Data (optional): Trending items, seasonal products, social media buzz (integrated via API).

2.  **Similarity Metric:**
    *   Calculate user-to-user similarity based on:
        *   **Purchase Overlap:** Jaccard Index of purchased items.
        *   **Category Preference:** Cosine similarity of category vectors (each user has a vector representing their preference for each category).
        *   **Price Sensitivity:**  Standard deviation of price ranges for purchased items.
        *   **Community Membership Overlap**:  Count of shared communities.
    *   Combine these metrics into a weighted composite similarity score.

3.  **Profile Synthesis Engine:**
    *   **Weighted Averaging:** For each user, create a predicted preference vector by averaging the preference vectors of their most similar users (weighted by similarity score).
    *   **Collaborative Filtering:** Identify items purchased by similar users that the target user has not yet purchased. Rank these items based on the similarity scores of the purchasers and the strength of the target user's inferred preference for the item's category.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously update the user's predicted preferences based on their recent activity (purchases, views, etc.). Use a decay factor to prioritize recent data.

4.  **Proactive Recommendation Interface:**
    *   **"Community Picks" Feed:**  A dedicated feed within the shopping app displaying items recommended based on the user’s synthesized profile.  Items should be labeled with a small icon indicating the number of community members who have purchased them.
    *   **"Inspired By Your Network" Section:** On item detail pages, display a section titled "Inspired By Your Network," showing items frequently purchased by users similar to the current user who also purchased this item.
    *   **Personalized Email/Push Notifications:**  Send proactive recommendations via email/push notifications, highlighting trending items within the user’s predicted interest categories.

5.  **Privacy Controls:**
    *   Users must explicitly opt-in to participate in the data sharing and profile synthesis features.
    *   Users should have the ability to control the level of data shared with the system.
    *   Data anonymization and aggregation techniques should be used to protect user privacy.

**Pseudocode (Profile Synthesis Engine - simplified):**

```
function synthesizeProfile(user, communityData):
  similarUsers = findSimilarUsers(user, communityData)  // returns list of users sorted by similarity
  weightedPreferences = {}
  for each similarUser in similarUsers:
    weight = calculateSimilarityScore(user, similarUser)
    for each item in similarUser.purchases:
      if item not in weightedPreferences:
        weightedPreferences[item] = 0
      weightedPreferences[item] += weight

  // Normalize weights & rank items
  rankedItems = sortItemsByWeight(weightedPreferences)
  return rankedItems
```
