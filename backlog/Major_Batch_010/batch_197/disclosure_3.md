## Adaptive Polarity & Energy Harvesting Micro-Grid

**Concept:** Expand the polarity adaptation beyond simply correcting input orientation. Integrate micro-energy harvesting and create a self-balancing, distributed micro-grid system suitable for powering low-energy sensors or devices in remote or difficult-to-access locations.

**Specs:**

*   **Node Architecture:** Each 'node' will consist of:
    *   Polarity Adaptive Bridge (PAB): Utilizing a modified version of the provided patent’s bridge circuit. Optimization towards lower Vgs and RDS(on) is required.
    *   Energy Harvesting Module: Piezoelectric, thermoelectric, or inductive coils – selectable based on the anticipated environmental energy source.
    *   Supercapacitor Storage: Integrated supercapacitor bank for accumulating harvested and adapted energy. Capacity: 1-10 Farads, Voltage: 2.7-5.5 Volts.
    *   Microcontroller (MCU): Low-power MCU (e.g., ARM Cortex-M0+) for energy management, data logging, and communication.
    *   Wireless Communication: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Zigbee for mesh network communication.
    *   Load Regulation: DC-DC buck-boost converter to provide a stable output voltage (e.g., 3.3V) to the connected load.

*   **Network Topology:** Mesh network. Nodes communicate with each other to share energy and balance loads. The network can dynamically adapt to node failures or changes in energy availability.

*   **Energy Sharing Protocol:** A distributed algorithm to determine energy flow between nodes.  Nodes will broadcast their current energy level and load demand. Neighboring nodes will negotiate energy transfer based on proximity, available energy, and demand.

    ```pseudocode
    // Node A receives energy request from Node B
    function handleEnergyRequest(Node B, energyRequestAmount) {
        if (myEnergyLevel > (myMinimumEnergyReserve + energyRequestAmount)) {
            transferEnergyTo(Node B, energyRequestAmount);
            log("Energy transferred to Node B");
        } else {
            log("Insufficient energy to fulfill request");
        }
    }

    // Node A broadcasts energy availability
    function broadcastEnergyAvailability() {
        energyData = {
            nodeID: myNodeID,
            energyLevel: myEnergyLevel,
            loadDemand: myLoadDemand
        };
        sendToNeighbors(energyData);
    }
    ```

*   **Load Balancing:** Distributed algorithm to allocate load based on available energy and node capabilities. Nodes can dynamically adjust their output power to optimize energy efficiency.

*   **Fault Tolerance:** Nodes are designed to operate autonomously even if other nodes fail.  The mesh network can reroute communication and redistribute loads around failed nodes.

*   **Materials:** Lightweight and durable materials for environmental protection.  Consider flexible substrates for conformal applications.

*   **Power Input:** The PAB will be configured to accept input from multiple sources: batteries (various polarities), energy harvesters, and potentially even external power supplies.

* **Expansion**: Integrate a small AI module at each node to predict energy availability, and load demands, and to optimize energy distribution across the network.
