**Automated Microfluidic Contact Angle & Surface Tension Profiler**

**Core Concept:** Integrate the optical contact angle measurement system with a microfluidic platform capable of dispensing and manipulating minute liquid volumes across a substrate. This creates a high-throughput, automated system for comprehensive surface characterization.

**I. Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Microfluidic Chip:**
    *   Material: PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) or glass.
    *   Channel Dimensions: Variable – customizable channel widths (10µm – 500µm) and depths (1µm – 100µm) via soft lithography or etching.  Multiple parallel channels for increased throughput.
    *   Integrated Micro-Pump: Piezoelectric or syringe-based pump for precise fluid delivery (nanoliter to microliter range).
    *   Heating/Cooling Element: Integrated resistive heater/Peltier element for temperature control (5°C - 85°C).
*   **Optical System (Adapted from Patent):**
    *   Dual/Multi-Direction Illumination: Maintain the multiple light source/mirror arrangement for capturing droplet profiles from various angles.
    *   High-Resolution Camera: 12MP+ monochrome camera with a macro lens.
    *   Beam Splitter:  Maintain the use of a beam splitter to combine multiple views onto the camera sensor.
    *   Polarization Control: Integrate a polarizer and analyzer to reduce reflections and enhance contrast.
*   **Stage & Control:**
    *   Automated XY Stage: Precision stage with micron-level resolution to move the substrate and/or microfluidic chip.
    *   Z-Axis Control: Precise Z-axis control for focusing the camera on the liquid droplet.
    *   Motorized Stage: Move dispensing needle across the substrate
*   **Fluid Handling:**
    *   Multiple Reservoirs:  Dedicated reservoirs for different liquids (water, oil, surfactants).
    *   Automated Valve System: Microfluidic valves to select and control fluid flow.
*   **Enclosure:** Enclosed chamber to control ambient temperature and humidity.

**II. Software & Control Algorithm:**

*   **Image Acquisition Module:** Capture images from the camera, apply image processing (noise reduction, edge detection).
*   **Droplet Detection & Segmentation:** Algorithm to automatically identify and segment the liquid droplet in the image.  Utilize machine learning (e.g., convolutional neural networks) for robust droplet detection.
*   **Contact Angle Calculation:** Use the Young-Laplace equation to calculate contact angles from the droplet profile.
*   **Surface Tension Calculation:** Implement algorithms to estimate surface tension based on droplet shape and size.
*   **Automated Mapping:**  Software to automatically move the stage, dispense droplets at defined locations, acquire images, and generate a contact angle map of the substrate.
*   **Data Analysis & Visualization:**  Software to analyze the contact angle data, generate graphs, and export data in various formats.
*   **Control Software:** Control the microfluidic pump, valves, stage, and camera.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Automated calibration routine to ensure accurate contact angle measurements.
*   **User Interface:** Intuitive graphical user interface for controlling the system and analyzing data.
