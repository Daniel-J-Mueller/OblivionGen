## Adaptive Interference Cancellation via Distributed Phase-Shift Arrays

**Concept:** Leverage the satellite’s ability to observe multiple user terminals’ signals simultaneously to implement a distributed interference cancellation system. Instead of relying solely on grant-based resource allocation, proactively shape the uplink signal phase from each UT to minimize interference *before* it reaches the satellite. This reduces the need for complex demodulation and processing on the satellite side and improves overall system capacity.

**Specs:**

*   **UT Hardware:**
    *   Small, low-power phase-shift module.  Ideally integrated into the existing RF front-end. (Cost target: <$5)
    *   Microcontroller with direct digital synthesis (DDS) capability.
    *   Real-time clock synchronization – crucial for coordinated phase adjustments. Synchronization via satellite beacon or network time protocol (NTP). Accuracy: <100ns.
*   **Satellite Hardware:**
    *   Beamforming array for both uplink and downlink.
    *   High-precision signal processing unit capable of estimating channel state information (CSI) for multiple UTs in real-time.
    *   Central control unit to coordinate phase adjustments across all UTs.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   **Phase Adjustment Command (PAC):** Satellite transmits PAC to each UT containing a suggested phase shift value. PAC includes a sequence number to prevent outdated commands from being applied.
    *   **Phase Confirmation (PC):** UT transmits PC to the satellite confirming the PAC was received and applied.
    *   **Channel Sounding:** UTs periodically transmit a known signal for the satellite to estimate CSI. Frequency: 10-100Hz.
*   **Algorithm (Satellite-Side):**

    ```pseudocode
    // Initialization
    Initialize CSI estimates for all UTs.
    Initialize phase shift values for all UTs to 0.

    // Real-time Loop
    For each time slot:
        // 1. Estimate CSI for all UTs based on channel sounding signals.
        CSI = EstimateChannelStateInformation(ReceivedSignals)

        // 2. Calculate Interference Matrix
        InterferenceMatrix = CalculateInterference(CSI)

        // 3. Compute Optimal Phase Shifts
        PhaseShifts = SolveForOptimalPhaseShifts(InterferenceMatrix) // Algorithm: Iterative Waterfilling, Gradient Descent, or similar optimization technique

        // 4. Generate PACs for each UT
        For each UT:
            PAC = CreatePhaseAdjustmentCommand(UT_ID, PhaseShifts[UT_ID])
            Transmit(PAC)

        // 5. Receive PCs from UTs
        For each PC:
            Update UT status (applied phase shift)
    ```

*   **UT Algorithm:**

    ```pseudocode
    // Initialization
    Initialize Phase Shift Value = 0

    // Real-time Loop
    While Receiving Signals:
        If Received PAC:
            If PAC Sequence Number > Current Sequence Number:
                Current Sequence Number = PAC Sequence Number
                New Phase Shift Value = PAC Phase Shift Value
                Apply Phase Shift to Transmitted Signal
                Transmit PC
    ```
*   **Error Handling:**

    *   If a UT fails to apply the suggested phase shift, it transmits an error code in the PC. The satellite can then re-transmit the PAC or adjust its overall strategy.
    *   Implement redundancy in the CSI estimation process to mitigate the impact of noisy or unreliable channel sounding signals.



**Novelty:** Existing systems primarily focus on *reacting* to interference through power control or scheduling. This system aims to *prevent* interference through proactive phase shaping.  It moves beyond simple grant allocation to a finer-grained control scheme leveraging the satellite's unique observability. The distributed nature of the phase-shifting minimizes the computational burden on the satellite.
