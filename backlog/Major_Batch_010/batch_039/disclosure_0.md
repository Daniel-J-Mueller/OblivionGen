## Dynamic Quorum Adjustment via Predictive Failure Analysis

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on *placement* of nodes for replication groups. This builds on that by dynamically adjusting quorum sizes *within* those replication groups based on predictive failure analysis of individual host systems. If a host is showing signs of impending failure, the system proactively *increases* the required quorum size for data writes involving replicas on that host, ensuring data durability *before* the failure occurs. Conversely, stable hosts can operate with slightly reduced quorum sizes for improved write performance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Failure Prediction Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Collect system metrics from each host including: CPU utilization, memory pressure, disk I/O, network latency, temperature, error logs (kernel, application, storage).
*   **Models:** Employ time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) trained on historical data to predict potential hardware or software failures. Output a "Health Score" (0-100) for each host. Scores below a threshold (e.g., 50) indicate high risk.  Separate models for different hardware components (disk, CPU, network).
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Incorporate anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify unexpected deviations from normal behavior which may signal an imminent failure, even if not captured by the forecasting models.

**2. Dynamic Quorum Manager:**

*   **Quorum Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   Define a base quorum size (e.g., majority of replicas).
    *   For each replica:
        *   If `Host Health Score < Threshold`: Increase the required quorum size by +1 for writes involving replicas on that host.
        *   If `Host Health Score > Stable Threshold`: Reduce the required quorum size by -1 (up to a minimum quorum size, e.g. majority).
    *   Implement hysteresis to prevent rapid fluctuations in quorum size.  (e.g. require health score to remain above/below thresholds for a sustained period before adjusting quorum).
*   **Integration with Consensus Protocol:**  The Dynamic Quorum Manager must interface with the underlying consensus protocol (e.g., Raft, Paxos) to enforce the adjusted quorum sizes. This may involve modifying the consensus protocol's leader election or commit phases.

**3. Monitoring and Alerting:**

*   Track quorum size adjustments and Health Scores in real-time.
*   Generate alerts when:
    *   A host’s Health Score falls below a critical threshold.
    *   The system is unable to achieve the required quorum due to widespread failures.
    *   Quorum adjustments are impacting write latency significantly.

**Pseudocode (Quorum Adjustment Logic):**

```
// Global Variables
baseQuorumSize = majority(numberOfReplicas)
hysteresisThreshold = 0.1 // percentage change in health score
stableThreshold = 80

// For each replica:
function adjustQuorum(replica, currentQuorumSize) {
  healthScore = getHealthScore(replica.host)

  if (healthScore < 50) {
    // Increase quorum
    newQuorumSize = currentQuorumSize + 1
  } else if (healthScore > 80) {
    // Decrease quorum
    newQuorumSize = max(currentQuorumSize - 1, majority(numberOfReplicas))
  } else {
    // Maintain current quorum
    newQuorumSize = currentQuorumSize
  }
  return newQuorumSize
}
```

**Deployment Considerations:**

*   The Failure Prediction Module can be implemented as a separate microservice communicating with the host systems via agents.
*   The Dynamic Quorum Manager should be integrated directly into the control plane of the replication system.
*   Thorough testing and benchmarking are crucial to ensure the system’s stability and performance under various failure scenarios.
