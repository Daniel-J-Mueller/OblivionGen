## Adaptive Resonance Network for Dynamic Credential Distribution

**Core Concept:** Leverage Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) networks to create a dynamic and self-organizing system for wireless credential distribution, extending beyond simple request/response models.  The system moves away from solely addressing *new* device onboarding, and focuses on continuous adaptation to network conditions and user behavior, improving security and efficiency.

**Specs:**

**1. Network Architecture:**

*   **ART Nodes:** Each wireless device participating in credential sharing (including access points) hosts an ART node.
*   **Resonance Layer:** The ART network forms a resonance layer, enabling devices to dynamically cluster based on signal strength, network load, device type, and user profiles (if available).
*   **Credential Vector:** Credentials aren’t simply ‘pushed’ or ‘received’. Instead, they’re encoded as a multi-dimensional vector representing network SSID, password, encryption type, quality of service (QoS) parameters, and access control lists.
*   **Vigilance Parameter:**  Each ART node utilizes a dynamically adjusted ‘vigilance’ parameter. This parameter controls the network's sensitivity to new information. Higher vigilance leads to more refined clusters (increased security, potentially lower connectivity), while lower vigilance encourages broader adaptation (better connectivity, potentially reduced security).

**2. Operation:**

*   **Beacon Enhancement:** The beacon signal (as in the patent) is augmented with a ‘resonance request’ – essentially, a broadcast seeking devices with similar network profiles.
*   **Resonance Matching:** When a device receives a resonance request, its ART node calculates a similarity score based on its credential vector. If the score exceeds a threshold, a ‘resonance link’ is established.
*   **Credential Negotiation:**  Over the resonance link, devices *negotiate* credentials. This isn't a simple exchange.  The system compares credential vectors and identifies potential improvements (e.g., a device with a more secure encryption key, a better QoS profile).
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors network conditions (signal strength, interference, load) and adjusts the vigilance parameter accordingly.  For example, in a congested network, vigilance might be lowered to prioritize connectivity.
*   **Trust Scoring:** Each device maintains a trust score for other devices based on the history of successful credential negotiations and compliance with network policies. Devices with low trust scores are excluded from the negotiation process.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  The ART network’s self-organizing capabilities can be used to detect anomalies in credential usage or network behavior.  For example, a device attempting to negotiate credentials with an invalid SSID or encryption type would be flagged as suspicious.

**3. Pseudocode (ART Node Logic):**

```
// Initialization
credentialVector = {SSID, Password, EncryptionType, QoS, AccessControlList}
trustScore = 0
vigilance = defaultVigilance

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Broadcast Resonance Request
  broadcastResonanceRequest(credentialVector)

  // Listen for Resonance Requests
  receivedRequest = listenForResonanceRequest()

  if (receivedRequest != null) {
    similarityScore = calculateSimilarity(credentialVector, receivedRequest.credentialVector)

    if (similarityScore > vigilance) {
      // Resonance Link Established
      negotiateCredentials(receivedRequest)
      updateTrustScore(receivedRequest)
    }
  }

  // Monitor Network Conditions
  networkCondition = monitorNetworkConditions()

  // Adjust Vigilance
  vigilance = adjustVigilance(networkCondition, vigilance)
}

// Function: adjustVigilance
// Input: networkCondition, currentVigilance
// Output: updatedVigilance
if (networkCondition == "congested") {
    updatedVigilance = currentVigilance - 0.05  // Lower vigilance to prioritize connectivity
} else if (networkCondition == "secure") {
    updatedVigilance = currentVigilance + 0.05  // Raise vigilance for enhanced security
} else {
    updatedVigilance = currentVigilance
}
return updatedVigilance
```

**4. Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   **Processing Power:** The ART network calculations require moderate processing power.  Existing wireless chipsets should be capable of handling the load.
*   **Memory:**  The ART network requires memory to store the credential vectors and trust scores.
*   **Software:** A lightweight ART library would need to be implemented on each wireless device.
*   **Security:**  Secure communication channels should be used to exchange credential vectors and trust scores.
