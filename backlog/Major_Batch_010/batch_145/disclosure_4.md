## Dynamic Query Rewriting via Learned Embeddings

**Concept:** Leverage learned embeddings of query predicates to proactively rewrite queries *before* execution, optimizing for potential conflicts based on predicted classification overlap. This moves beyond reactive conflict detection to proactive mitigation.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Predicate Embedding Model:** Train a deep learning model (e.g., Siamese network, Transformer) to generate vector embeddings for query predicates (the `WHERE` clause). Training data consists of historical queries and their associated classifications.  The model learns to represent semantically similar predicates with close vector embeddings.  

    *   **Input:**  Parsed predicate (e.g., "age > 30", "city = 'New York'"). Represent as a sequence of tokens.
    *   **Output:** Fixed-size vector embedding.
    *   **Training:**  Contrastive loss to pull embeddings of predicates belonging to the same classification closer together, and push those belonging to different classifications further apart.  Utilize data augmentation (e.g., paraphrasing predicates) to improve robustness.

2.  **Classification Graph:** Maintain a graph where nodes represent classifications (as determined by the original patent's classification functions). Edges represent the degree of overlap (conflict potential) between classifications.  

    *   **Edge Weight:** Calculated dynamically based on historical data of concurrent reads and writes affecting those classifications. Higher weight indicates greater conflict probability.
    *   **Graph Updates:** Regularly update edge weights based on real-time monitoring of database activity.

3.  **Query Rewrite Engine:**  Upon receiving a query:

    *   **Predicate Embedding:** Generate embeddings for each predicate in the queryâ€™s `WHERE` clause using the trained model.
    *   **Classification Prediction:** Use the embeddings to predict the likely classifications the query will access.  This can be done by finding the nearest classifications in the embedding space, or by training a classifier on the embeddings to predict classifications directly.
    *   **Conflict Risk Assessment:**  Using the Classification Graph, assess the conflict risk associated with the predicted classifications.  Identify classifications currently undergoing heavy write activity.
    *   **Query Rewriting:**
        *   **Predicate Reordering:** Reorder predicates in the `WHERE` clause to prioritize filtering based on classifications with low conflict risk.
        *   **Predicate Splitting:** Split complex predicates into multiple simpler predicates, allowing for more targeted filtering and reduced classification overlap. For example, `"age > 30 AND city = 'New York'"` could be rewritten as `"age > 30" AND "city = 'New York'"`.
        *   **Query Partitioning (Advanced):**  If the query accesses a large dataset, partition the query into multiple smaller queries, each targeting a specific classification.  Results are then combined.
        *   **Adaptive Thresholding:** Dynamically adjust the thresholds for conflict risk based on overall system load and performance.
4. **Monitoring and Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitor the effectiveness of query rewriting. Track metrics such as:

    *   Conflict rate (number of conflicts detected after rewriting).
    *   Query latency.
    *   Resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O).
    *   Rewrite success rate (percentage of queries successfully rewritten).
    *   Use this data to retrain the embedding model and refine the query rewriting strategies.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function rewriteQuery(query):
  predicates = extractPredicates(query)
  embeddings = generateEmbeddings(predicates)
  predictedClassifications = predictClassifications(embeddings)
  conflictRisk = assessConflictRisk(predictedClassifications)

  if conflictRisk > threshold:
    rewrittenPredicates = optimizePredicates(predicates, predictedClassifications)
    rewrittenQuery = constructQuery(rewrittenPredicates)
    return rewrittenQuery
  else:
    return query

function optimizePredicates(predicates, classifications):
  # Implement predicate reordering, splitting, or partitioning based on classifications
  # Prioritize predicates associated with low-conflict classifications
  return optimizedPredicates
```

This system proactively adapts to potential conflicts, improving database performance and scalability. The learned embeddings and dynamic graph provide a flexible and intelligent approach to query optimization.
