## Dynamic Content Reflow with Per-Glyph Styling

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic reflow concept to not just adjust line layout but to *individually* style glyphs based on available space and reading context, creating a more visually dynamic and readable experience. This moves beyond simple scaling or alignment changes and introduces per-glyph control.

**Specifications:**

**1. Glyph Style Database:**

*   **Data Structure:** A lookup table (hash map preferred) associating glyphs (Unicode codepoints or glyph identifiers) with style variations. Style variations include:
    *   **Width Scale:**  A floating-point value representing a scaling factor for the glyph's width.
    *   **Kerning Offset:**  A pixel value to adjust the spacing *after* the glyph.
    *   **Vertical Shift:** A pixel value to subtly adjust the vertical position of the glyph.
    *   **Contrast Adjustment:** A percentage value to subtly alter the glyph's color contrast.
*   **Population:** The database is populated using:
    *   **Predefined Rules:**  Rules based on glyph category (e.g., punctuation, numerals, ideographs).
    *   **AI-Driven Analysis:**  An AI model trained to identify glyphs that benefit from stylistic adjustment based on readability and aesthetic criteria.  The AI considers context (surrounding glyphs, language, font).
    *   **User Preferences:**  Allow users to define custom style variations for specific glyphs or glyph categories.

**2.  Reflow Engine Modification:**

*   **Line Layout Analysis:**  During line layout, before rendering, the engine analyzes the available space on the line and identifies glyphs that *could* benefit from stylistic adjustment.
*   **Style Selection:** For each eligible glyph, the engine:
    *   **Checks the Style Database:**  Determines if a style variation exists for the glyph.
    *   **Calculates Adjustment Factor:** Determines a scaling factor based on the available space and desired visual density.  A limited scaling range (e.g., 90-110%) is enforced to prevent excessive distortion.
    *   **Selects Optimal Style:** Chooses the style variation that best balances visual density, readability, and aesthetic criteria.
*   **Rendering Pipeline Integration:** The selected style variations are applied to each glyph during the rendering process.  This can be implemented using shader programs or direct manipulation of glyph rendering parameters.

**3. Contextual Awareness:**

*   **Language Detection:**  The engine detects the language of the content to apply language-specific stylistic rules.
*   **Reading Mode Detection:** The engine detects the reading mode (horizontal, vertical, right-to-left) and adjusts the styling accordingly.
*   **Emphasis Detection:** The engine analyzes the content to identify emphasized text (e.g., bold, italic) and applies corresponding stylistic adjustments.
*    **Hierarchical Depth:**  Styling is adjusted based on section headings and paragraph structures within the text. This could include subtle contrast adjustments to differentiate heading levels.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function renderLine(lineContent, availableWidth):
  glyphList = tokenize(lineContent)
  totalWidth = 0

  for glyph in glyphList:
    style = getGlyphStyle(glyph, availableWidth, readingMode, language)

    scaledWidth = glyph.width * style.widthScale
    adjustedWidth = scaledWidth + style.kerningOffset

    if totalWidth + adjustedWidth > availableWidth:
      // Handle overflow (e.g., line break, scaling down)
      break

    renderGlyph(glyph, style.verticalShift, style.contrastAdjustment)
    totalWidth += adjustedWidth

  return
```

**Innovation:**  This system moves beyond simple line reflow to create a dynamic and personalized reading experience. It introduces the concept of per-glyph styling, allowing the engine to subtly adjust the appearance of individual characters to optimize readability and visual appeal. This is especially useful for complex scripts (e.g., Asian languages) and content with varying visual density.
