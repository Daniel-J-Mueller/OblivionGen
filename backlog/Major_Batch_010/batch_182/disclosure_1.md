## Dynamic Semantic Map Fusion with Predictive Occlusion

**Concept:** Expand the static semantic layer concept to a dynamic, multi-sensor fusion system incorporating predictive occlusion modeling. This goes beyond simply *detecting* objects; it anticipates where objects *might* be hidden from current sensors, creating a more robust and reliable navigation space.

**Specs:**

**1. Sensor Suite:**
    *   LiDAR (High Resolution, 360-degree)
    *   Stereo Vision Cameras (RGB-D) – multiple pairs
    *   Radar (Long-Range Object Detection)
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – for precise vehicle motion tracking.
    *   Acoustic sensors - for detection of non-visual obstructions (e.g. netting, wiring)

**2. Data Fusion & Semantic Mapping Module:**

    *   **Input:** Raw sensor data streams.
    *   **Processing:**
        *   **Sensor Calibration & Synchronization:** Rigorous calibration and timestamp synchronization of all sensors.
        *   **Point Cloud Registration:** Align point clouds from LiDAR and stereo cameras into a unified coordinate frame.
        *   **Object Detection & Classification:** Utilize deep learning models (e.g., YOLO, SSD) to detect and classify objects within the fused point cloud and imagery.
        *   **Semantic Layer Generation:** Create a 3D semantic layer representing objects with bounding shapes and associated semantic labels.
    *   **Output:** Dynamic semantic layer with object positions, sizes, and classifications.

**3. Predictive Occlusion Modeling Module:**

    *   **Input:** Dynamic semantic layer, Vehicle trajectory, Historical environmental data, Sensor Field of View data.
    *   **Processing:**
        *   **Ray Tracing:** Simulate rays from sensors, accounting for sensor FOV and resolution.
        *   **Visibility Analysis:** Determine which regions are occluded by existing objects, and calculate probability of an object existing in an occluded region.
        *   **Historical Data Integration:** Incorporate historical environmental maps (e.g., previously detected objects, known static structures) to refine occlusion predictions.
        *   **Object Prediction:** Generate "phantom" bounding boxes in occluded regions, representing potential obstructions with associated confidence levels.
    *   **Output:** Enhanced semantic layer with phantom bounding boxes indicating potential occlusions.

**4. Configuration Space Generation & Navigation Planning:**

    *   **Input:** Enhanced semantic layer, Vehicle parameters (dimensions, maneuverability), Destination location.
    *   **Processing:**
        *   **Configuration Space Construction:** Generate a configuration space representing valid vehicle configurations (position, orientation) that avoid collisions with both detected and predicted objects.
        *   **Path Planning:** Utilize path planning algorithms (e.g., A*, RRT) to find an optimal collision-free path through the configuration space.
    *   **Output:** Navigation route, Vehicle control commands.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Occlusion Modeling Module):**

```
function predictOcclusions(semanticLayer, vehicleTrajectory, historicalData, sensorFOV):
  occlusionMap = empty map

  for each sensor in sensorSuite:
    for each point in sensorFOV:
      ray = createRay(sensor, point)
      intersections = findIntersections(ray, semanticLayer)

      if intersections is not empty:
        closestIntersection = findClosest(intersections)
        if distance(sensor, closestIntersection) < maxSensorRange:
          markRegionAsOccluded(occlusionMap, point)

      else:
        # No intersections, check historical data
        if historicalData contains object in region around point:
          addPhantomBoundingBox(occlusionMap, point, historicalData)

  return occlusionMap
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus on detecting and avoiding *visible* obstacles. This concept adds predictive modeling to anticipate hidden obstructions, enhancing safety and reliability in complex environments. This leverages historical data with advanced ray tracing to fill in gaps of sensor data, greatly improving robustness.
