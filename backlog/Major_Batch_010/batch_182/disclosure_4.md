## Dynamic Cache Partitioning via Packet-Driven Function Selection

**Specification:** A system for dynamically partitioning a shared cache based on incoming packet characteristics, going beyond static function assignment per packet type. This enhances multi-context cache utilization and reduces context switching overhead.

**Core Concept:** Instead of *selecting* a cache function (CRC or otherwise) based solely on packet *type*, the system analyzes packet *content* in real-time to dynamically adjust the cache function *parameters* used for mapping. This allows for finer-grained cache partitioning than type-based assignment, accommodating variations *within* a packet type.

**Components:**

1.  **Packet Inspector & Analyzer:**  Examines incoming packets to identify key attributes beyond type. These could include priority level, source/destination addresses (partial or full), payload size, or specific flag settings.
2.  **Function Parameter Generator (FPG):**  Based on the attributes identified by the Packet Inspector, the FPG dynamically generates parameters for the cache function. These parameters modulate the function’s output, influencing the cache index mapping.  Think of this as a “tuning knob” on the CRC or other hashing algorithm.
3.  **Dynamic Function Table (DFT):** Stores a range of pre-defined cache functions, along with their corresponding parameter sets. The DFT is indexed by packet type, then further refined by the parameters generated by the FPG.
4.  **Cache Mapper:** Receives the packet type, generated function parameters, and main memory address. It retrieves the appropriate cache function from the DFT, applies the parameters, and uses the modified function to map the memory address to a cache index.

**Pseudocode (Cache Mapper):**

```
function map_to_cache(packet, memory_address):
  packet_type = determine_packet_type(packet)
  packet_attributes = analyze_packet_attributes(packet)
  function_parameters = generate_function_parameters(packet_attributes)

  cache_function = lookup_cache_function(packet_type, function_parameters) // From DFT

  cache_index = apply_cache_function(cache_function, memory_address)

  return cache_index
```

**DFT Structure:**

The DFT can be organized as a two-level table:

*   **Level 1:** Indexed by `packet_type`.
*   **Level 2:**  Indexed by a `parameter_set_hash`. Each entry contains the cache function itself, and any associated metadata (e.g. cache line size preference for this parameter set).

**Parameter Examples (CRC Function):**

*   **Seed Value Offset:** Instead of a static seed, the seed can be calculated as: `seed = static_base_seed + hash(packet.source_address)`.
*   **Polynomial Modulation:** Vary the polynomial used in the CRC calculation based on packet priority. Higher priority packets could use more complex polynomials to reduce collisions.
*   **Input Bit Mask:**  Dynamically mask certain bits of the memory address input to the CRC function, based on packet payload size.

**Benefits:**

*   **Improved Cache Hit Rate:** Finer-grained partitioning allows more efficient use of cache space, reducing conflicts between different data contexts.
*   **Reduced Context Switching:** By adapting the cache mapping on a per-packet basis, the need for full cache flushes or context switching can be minimized.
*   **Scalability:**  The system can adapt to a wider range of packet types and variations without requiring significant hardware modifications.
*   **Adaptive Behavior:** The system can learn optimal parameter sets over time using machine learning techniques.
