## Adaptive Oscillation Networks for Neuromorphic Computing

**Concept:** Extend the parallel ring oscillator network beyond random number generation into a configurable analog compute substrate for simplified neuromorphic processing. Instead of *preventing* phase-lock, embrace controlled phase-locking *between* oscillators to represent and process information.

**Specs:**

*   **Oscillator Array:** 2D array of ring oscillators (minimum 32x32, scalable). Each oscillator individually configurable (frequency, amplitude, symmetry). Utilize the existing PRNG/configuration circuit for initial oscillator setup/tuning.
*   **Coupling Matrix:** Programmable coupling network connecting oscillators. Each oscillator can be connected to any neighbor (north, south, east, west, diagonal) with adjustable coupling strength (0-1, analog). Implemented using digitally controlled resistors or transconductance amplifiers.
*   **Synaptic Weight Storage:** Dedicated SRAM or embedded flash memory for storing synaptic weights corresponding to each coupling link. Weights are mapped to coupling strengths.
*   **Non-Linear Activation:** Integrate a local non-linear function (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU) into each oscillator’s output. This can be achieved with a simple current mirror or translinear circuit.
*   **Readout Layer:** Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) connected to selected oscillator outputs to read the network's state. Alternatively, a weighted summation circuit (analog or digital) for direct analog readout.
*   **PRNG Integration:** Leverage the existing PRNG for exploratory learning. Introduce controlled noise/perturbations to oscillator frequencies/coupling weights to enable stochastic gradient descent-like learning.

**Operation:**

1.  **Encoding:** Input data is encoded as initial oscillator frequencies. Higher values = higher frequencies.
2.  **Synaptic Mapping:** Synaptic weights define the coupling strengths between oscillators. This forms the network’s connectivity.
3.  **Propagation:** Oscillations propagate through the network based on coupling strengths. The network settles into a stable state.
4.  **Readout:** The stable state is read out using the ADC or summation circuit. The output represents the processed information.

**Pseudocode (Learning/Training):**

```
// Training Loop
for each training example {
  // Encode input data into oscillator frequencies
  encode_input(input_data, oscillator_frequencies)

  // Forward pass (propagation through network)
  network_state = propagate_oscillations(oscillator_frequencies, coupling_weights)

  // Calculate error
  error = calculate_error(network_state, desired_output)

  // Update coupling weights based on error
  for each coupling link {
    gradient = calculate_gradient(error, coupling_weight)
    new_coupling_weight = coupling_weight - learning_rate * gradient
    update_coupling_weight(new_coupling_weight)
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This moves beyond RNG to exploit the natural dynamics of coupled oscillators for computation.  The adjustable coupling matrix and non-linear activation functions create a flexible analog compute substrate capable of implementing neural networks with inherent parallelism and low power consumption. Utilizing the PRNG provides a built-in mechanism for exploration and learning. The architecture offers a pathway towards energy-efficient neuromorphic processing.
