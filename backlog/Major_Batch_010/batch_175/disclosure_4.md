## Dynamic Emotional Soundscape Generation

**Concept:** Extend stem-based volume equalization to incorporate real-time emotional analysis of *both* audio and video, and generate a dynamic, evolving soundscape tailored to the perceived emotional state.  Instead of simply adjusting volume *within* stems, dynamically *morph* the stems themselves into new sonic textures based on emotional cues.

**Specifications:**

**1. Input & Analysis Modules:**

*   **Multi-Modal Input:** Accept audio and video streams as input.
*   **Emotional Analysis (Audio):** Utilize pre-trained models (or develop new ones) to analyze audio for emotional cues (e.g., valence, arousal, dominance) from speech, music, and sound effects. Focus on prosodic features, spectral characteristics, and content analysis.
*   **Emotional Analysis (Video):** Employ facial expression recognition (FER), body language analysis, and scene understanding to infer emotional states.  Combine these to create a ‘visual emotional fingerprint’.
*   **Emotional Fusion:** Develop an algorithm to fuse audio and video emotional data into a single, coherent ‘emotional state vector’. Weighting factors (user-adjustable) should allow preference for audio or video dominance in the emotional assessment.

**2. Stem Morphing Engine:**

*   **Stem Isolation:** Implement advanced source separation techniques to isolate individual stems (dialogue, music, sound effects, ambient noise). The system *must* be capable of creating new stems dynamically from existing ones.
*   **Morphing Parameter Mapping:**  Map emotional state vector components to specific audio processing parameters for each stem.  Examples:
    *   *Valence (Positive/Negative)*: Controls the amount of harmonic distortion, chorus, or reverb applied to music stems.  Positive valence increases these effects; negative valence introduces distortion or filters.
    *   *Arousal (Calm/Excited)*: Modulates the tempo and pitch of music stems.  High arousal increases tempo and adds pitch shifting; low arousal slows tempo and applies pitch reduction.
    *   *Dominance (Submissive/Assertive)*: Adjusts the dynamic range of dialogue stems. Assertive states increase dynamic range; submissive states compress it.
*   **Sonic Texture Synthesis:** Beyond simple parameter adjustments, implement techniques to *morph* stems into entirely new sonic textures.  This could involve:
    *   **Granular Synthesis:**  Break down stems into small grains and reassemble them with altered parameters based on emotional cues.
    *   **Spectral Morphing:** Crossfade the spectral characteristics of different stems to create hybrid sounds.
    *   **Convolution Reverb:** Use emotionally-linked impulse responses to shape the acoustic environment of each stem.

**3. Output & Control:**

*   **Real-Time Processing:** All processing must occur in real-time with minimal latency.
*   **User Customization:** Provide a GUI for users to:
    *   Adjust emotional weighting factors.
    *   Define custom mappings between emotional states and audio processing parameters.
    *   Select pre-defined ‘emotional profiles’ (e.g., “Suspenseful”, “Romantic”, “Action-Packed”).
    *   Control the overall intensity of the effect.
*   **Stem Mixing Control:** Provide a basic mixing console for adjusting the levels of individual stems.



**Pseudocode (Core Processing Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    // 1. Input & Analysis
    audio_input = get_audio_stream()
    video_input = get_video_stream()

    audio_emotion = analyze_audio_emotion(audio_input)
    video_emotion = analyze_video_emotion(video_input)

    emotion_state = fuse_emotions(audio_emotion, video_emotion)

    // 2. Stem Isolation & Morphing
    stems = isolate_stems(audio_input)

    FOR EACH stem IN stems:
        morphed_stem = apply_emotional_morphing(stem, emotion_state)
        //Apply EQ and other effects

    // 3. Output
    output_audio = mix_stems(morphed_stems)
    play_audio(output_audio)

END LOOP
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Immersive gaming and VR experiences.
*   Adaptive film and television soundtracks.
*   Emotionally responsive music playback.
*   Accessibility tools for users with emotional processing difficulties.
