## Multi-Spectral Computational Photography Array

**Concept:** Expand the camera array concept to capture data beyond the visible spectrum, creating a device capable of advanced material analysis, environmental sensing, and augmented reality applications.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Configuration:**  A hexagonal close-packed arrangement of 19 miniature cameras. Each camera is equipped with a narrow-band optical filter.
*   **Spectral Range:** Filters span from 400nm (Violet) to 900nm (Near Infrared) with 20nm bandwidth, covering the visible spectrum and a portion of the near infrared.  Additional filters centered on specific wavelengths for material identification (e.g. chlorophyll absorption peak at 680nm).
*   **Camera Specs (per unit):** 
    *   Sensor: 1/4" monochrome CMOS sensor (2048x1536 resolution).
    *   Lens: Fixed focal length (28mm equivalent) with a wide aperture (f/2.0).
    *   Pixel Size: 3.2µm
*   **Mounting:** Cameras are mounted on a curved surface to minimize distortion and maximize field of view. Precise positioning is maintained via a MEMS-based micro-actuator system allowing for dynamic calibration.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated image signal processor (ISP) and FPGA for real-time data acquisition, calibration, and multi-spectral image fusion.
*   **Power:** Low-power design for portable applications, utilizing a battery management system.

**Innovation Details:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Each camera captures a monochrome image through its designated filter.  Synchronization is crucial – a hardware trigger ensures simultaneous capture across all cameras.

2.  **Calibration Routine (Pseudocode):**

    ```
    FOR each camera IN camera_array:
        CAPTURE calibration_pattern (chessboard)
        DETECT corners
        CALCULATE intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients)
        CALCULATE extrinsic parameters (rotation and translation relative to a global coordinate system)
    END FOR

    PERFORM bundle adjustment to refine all parameters based on overlapping features
    ```

3.  **Multi-Spectral Image Fusion (Pseudocode):**

    ```
    INPUT: Raw images from all cameras, calibration parameters
    FOR each pixel IN output_image:
        FOR each camera IN camera_array:
            PROJECT pixel location onto camera image plane using extrinsic parameters
            SAMPLE pixel value from projected location
            APPLY radiometric calibration to convert to reflectance value
        END FOR

        CREATE multi-spectral vector by concatenating reflectance values from all cameras
        ASSIGN multi-spectral vector to pixel location in output_image
    END FOR
    ```

4.  **Applications:**

    *   **Precision Agriculture:** Assess plant health, identify nutrient deficiencies, and optimize irrigation.
    *   **Environmental Monitoring:** Detect pollutants, monitor water quality, and track deforestation.
    *   **Medical Diagnostics:**  Non-invasive skin analysis, wound assessment, and early cancer detection.
    *   **Augmented Reality:** Enhance AR experiences with real-world material identification and data overlays.
    *   **Security:** Counterfeit detection, material verification, and forensic analysis.

5.  **Dynamic Calibration System:** Integrated MEMS actuators enable real-time adjustment of camera angles, compensating for environmental factors (temperature, vibration) and improving image quality.  Algorithm: iterative optimization based on feature tracking and image sharpness metrics.
