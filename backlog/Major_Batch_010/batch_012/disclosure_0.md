## Personalized Proximity-Based Purchase Confirmation

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Communication device (smartphone, smartwatch, dedicated IoT device) with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon detection, microphone, and secure element (e.g., NFC chip, secure enclave). Retailer-deployed BLE beacons in physical store locations.
*   **Software:** Mobile application with user account linking. Backend server for managing user preferences, beacon data, and transaction validation. Secure communication protocols (TLS/SSL) for all data transmission.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Initial Selection & Code Generation:** User browses an online sales listing (as in the provided patent). Upon selection, a unique code is generated *and* a proximity-based confirmation step is initiated.
2.  **Proximity Trigger:** The system instructs the user to visit a participating retail location. The mobile app actively scans for BLE beacons associated with the retailer.
3.  **Beacon Detection & Audio Cue:** When the user is within a predefined range of a beacon (e.g., within a specific aisle or checkout area), the app triggers an audio cue (a unique chime or spoken phrase) *and* displays a visual prompt on the screen.
4.  **Voice Confirmation & Secure Element:** The prompt requests the user to verbally confirm their intention to purchase (“Confirm purchase” or a similar phrase). The microphone captures the voice confirmation. The captured audio is processed locally on the device using voice recognition software, *and* a digital signature of the voiceprint is generated.
5.  **Secure Element Validation:** The digital signature is stored *only* in the device's secure element. The secure element *also* generates a one-time-use token linked to both the code and the voiceprint signature.
6.  **Transaction Completion:** The device transmits the code *and* the one-time-use token to the backend server. The server verifies the token’s validity using the secure element’s cryptographic keys, confirming the user's presence *and* verbal intent. The purchase is then completed.
7.  **Optional - Multi-Factor Authentication:** Incorporate geolocation services for an additional layer of verification. The system confirms the user's location matches the beacon's location.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On Mobile Device
function onCodeReceived(code) {
  startBeaconScan();
  displayProximityInstructions();
}

function onBeaconDetected() {
  displayConfirmationPrompt();
  startVoiceRecording();
}

function onVoiceRecorded(audio) {
  voiceSignature = generateVoiceSignature(audio);
  token = generateSecureToken(voiceSignature, code);
  sendPurchaseRequest(code, token);
}

// On Backend Server
function validatePurchaseRequest(code, token) {
  if (verifyToken(token, code)) {
    completePurchase(code);
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This builds upon the existing patent by adding a strong physical presence verification layer. It’s not just about receiving a code; it’s about *confirming the purchase in person* using voice biometrics and proximity detection, creating a more secure and potentially fraud-resistant transaction process.  This moves beyond simple two-factor authentication (code + SMS) to a more robust, location-aware, biometric-enhanced system.
