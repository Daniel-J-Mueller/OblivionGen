## Adaptive Meta-Surface Beam Steering for Dynamic Network Topologies

**Concept:** Integrate dynamically reconfigurable meta-surface technology into the optical switches described in the patent to achieve precise, beam-steering capabilities *within* the switch itself, rather than relying solely on fiber routing. This allows for a significantly more flexible and dense network topology, and opens possibilities for real-time optimization of signal paths based on network conditions.

**Specifications:**

*   **Meta-Surface Material:** Liquid crystal meta-surfaces, or dynamically adjustable dielectric meta-surfaces. Goal: achieve sub-wavelength resolution control of electromagnetic wavefronts.
*   **Switch Architecture:** Replace the LCOS or silicon waveguide switches with planar meta-surface arrays. Each “pixel” of the array acts as an independent beam steering element.
*   **Control System:** Dedicated FPGA-based controller. Input: Network management system data (traffic load, link health, etc.). Output: Pixel-level control signals for meta-surface array.
*   **Wavelength Support:** Design meta-surface elements to operate across the C-band (1530-1565 nm) or extended band as needed.  Consider multi-layer designs for wider spectral coverage.
*   **Switch Dimensions:**  Target 16x16 or 32x32 array of beam steering elements per switch. Goal is to support a high degree of connectivity within a small footprint.
*   **Beam Steering Range:** Minimum ±15 degrees steering angle in both horizontal and vertical planes.  Ability to focus beams to a minimum spot size of λ/2 (where λ is the wavelength).
*   **Switching Speed:** Target <100ns switching time between beam steering configurations.  This requires fast control electronics and responsive meta-surface materials.
*   **Integration with WDM:** Integrate the meta-surface switch *before* the WDM multiplexer/demultiplexer. This allows the meta-surface switch to steer individual wavelengths to the correct channels *before* they are combined or separated.
*    **Power Budget:** Target <10dB optical loss across the switch. Minimize insertion loss through careful material selection and design optimization.

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```
// Network State Variables (updated by Network Management System)
traffic_load[port][wavelength]
link_health[port]
port_capacity[port]

// Meta-Surface Control Function
function steer_beam(source_port, destination_port, wavelength):
    // Calculate optimal steering angles
    angle_x, angle_y = calculate_angles(source_port, destination_port)

    // Apply angles to meta-surface pixels
    for each pixel in meta-surface:
        pixel.set_angle(angle_x, angle_y)

    // Update beam profile
    update_beam_profile()
```

**Novelty:**  Existing optical switches primarily rely on mechanical or static waveguide routing. This design moves to a fully electronic, dynamic beam steering approach that can adapt in real-time to changing network demands. The pre-WDM integration is also unique – enabling wavelength-aware routing within the switch itself. This will result in far greater connectivity possibilities.
