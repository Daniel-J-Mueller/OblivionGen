**Dynamic Visual Programming Node ‘Morphing’**

**Specification:**

**Core Concept:** Extend the ability to combine/collapse visual programming nodes (as described in the provided patent) with a system allowing for *dynamic* alteration of these combined nodes *at runtime*. Essentially, a ‘collapsed’ node isn’t static; it can re-expand or re-configure itself based on incoming data or user interaction, exposing/hiding functionality on the fly.

**Technical Details:**

1.  **Morphing Node Definition:** A special node type – the ‘Morphing Node’ – will be introduced.  This node contains not only the combined functionality of its constituent nodes, but also a ‘morphing script’ or rule set.
2.  **Morphing Script:** The morphing script is a data structure (potentially a tree or graph itself) that defines conditions and associated node expansions/contractions/reconfigurations.  These conditions can be based on:
    *   **Input Data:** Values of input signals trigger changes. (e.g., "If Input A > 10, expose Node B, otherwise hide it.")
    *   **User Interaction:** A button press or slider adjustment within the visual programming environment triggers a reconfiguration.
    *   **Internal State:**  The internal state of the morphing node itself can influence the configuration.
    *   **External Signals:** A signal from another part of the visual programming graph can trigger changes.
3.  **Runtime Reconfiguration:** The morphing node will monitor its inputs, internal state, and external signals. When a defined condition is met, the node will dynamically:
    *   **Expand:** Re-expose previously hidden constituent nodes.
    *   **Contract:** Hide constituent nodes.
    *   **Re-route Connections:**  Dynamically connect/disconnect input/output ports.
    *   **Modify Parameters:** Adjust parameters of its internal nodes.
4.  **Serialization & Persistence:** Morphing node configurations must be serializable so that complex configurations can be saved and reloaded.  Consider a JSON-based serialization format.
5.  **Security Considerations:** Access control mechanisms need to be implemented to prevent malicious morphing scripts from compromising the system.

**Pseudocode (Morphing Node Execution):**

```
function executeMorphingNode(morphingNode, inputs) {
  // 1. Evaluate Morphing Script Conditions
  conditionsMet = evaluateMorphingScript(morphingNode.morphingScript, inputs, morphingNode.internalState)

  // 2. Apply Changes Based on Conditions
  for each change in conditionsMet {
    if (change.type == "expand") {
      expandNode(change.nodeID)
    } else if (change.type == "contract") {
      contractNode(change.nodeID)
    } else if (change.type == "reconnect") {
      reconnectPorts(change.sourcePort, change.targetPort)
    } else if (change.type == "parameterChange") {
      setParameter(change.nodeID, change.parameterName, change.parameterValue)
    }
  }

  // 3. Execute Internal Nodes
  executeInternalNodes(morphingNode.internalNodes, inputs)

  // 4. Update Internal State
  morphingNode.internalState = calculateNewInternalState(morphingNode.internalState, inputs)
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Adaptive User Interfaces:** Morphing nodes can dynamically adjust the visual programming graph based on user actions or preferences.
*   **Real-time Data Analysis:** Nodes can reconfigure themselves based on incoming data streams, prioritizing different analytical pathways.
*   **Procedural Content Generation:** Morphing nodes can dynamically alter procedural rules, creating varied and evolving content.
*   **AI-Driven Optimization:**  An AI agent could dynamically reconfigure morphing nodes to optimize performance or efficiency.
