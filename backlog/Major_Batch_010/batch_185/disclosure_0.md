## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Dynamic Mesh Refinement

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple wall detection to create a dynamic, real-time 3D acoustic mesh of the environment. This isn't just about identifying surfaces, but understanding *how* sound interacts with the entire space, including furniture, people, and transient objects.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-microphone array (minimum 8 mics, optimally 16+) integrated into a mobile device or dedicated sensor.  High-frequency sampling rate (minimum 96kHz). GPU processing unit for mesh manipulation.
*   **Software – Core Modules:**
    *   **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**  Synchronized microphone input. Noise reduction algorithms (adaptive filtering, spectral subtraction).
    *   **Impulse Response Mapping:**  Utilize a modified version of the patent’s sparse deconvolution algorithm, but instead of focusing solely on walls, apply it to a voxel grid representing the entire space.  The algorithm estimates impulse responses for *every* voxel.  Exponential decay constants are dynamically adjusted based on material properties (estimated – see ‘Material Estimation’ below).
    *   **Mesh Generation & Refinement:** An initial low-resolution mesh is created from the voxel grid.  Mesh refinement is performed *adaptively* based on impulse response characteristics.  Voxels with high-amplitude or complex impulse responses are subdivided, increasing mesh density in those areas.  Areas with minimal sound reflection (e.g., open space) are coarsened.
    *   **Material Estimation:**  Employ machine learning (trained on a database of material impulse responses) to estimate the material properties of surfaces based on the measured impulse responses. This data is fed back into the mesh refinement process, and helps to determine the correct level of detail.  (e.g., a large, flat, absorptive surface like a curtain will require fewer polygons than a small, reflective surface like glass).
    *   **Dynamic Object Tracking & Incorporation:**  Implement a real-time object tracking system (using computer vision data from a camera integrated into the device) to identify and track moving objects. These objects are incorporated into the acoustic mesh as temporary, dynamic elements. The system adjusts the mesh in real-time to account for changes in the environment.
    *   **Acoustic Ray Tracing Engine:**  Integrate a lightweight ray tracing engine that uses the dynamic acoustic mesh to simulate sound propagation in the environment. This allows for realistic audio rendering and spatialization.
*   **Pseudocode (Mesh Refinement):**

```pseudocode
function refineMesh(voxelGrid, impulseResponses):
    mesh = createInitialMesh(voxelGrid)
    for each voxel in voxelGrid:
        impulseResponse = impulseResponses[voxel]
        complexity = calculateImpulseResponseComplexity(impulseResponse)  // Based on peaks, decay rate, etc.
        if complexity > threshold:
            subdivideVoxel(voxel)  // Increase mesh density
        else:
            coarsenVoxel(voxel) // Decrease mesh density
    return mesh
```

*   **Output:**  A real-time, dynamic 3D acoustic mesh of the environment, along with a ray tracing engine capable of simulating sound propagation.
*   **Potential Applications:** Advanced spatial audio rendering, virtual/augmented reality, acoustic scene understanding for robotics, noise mapping, structural analysis, and assistive technologies for the visually impaired.
