## Adaptive Acoustic Beamforming with Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** Enhance directional sound capture and user experience by integrating real-time biofeedback data (e.g., EEG, heart rate variability) to dynamically adjust acoustic beamforming parameters. The system anticipates user focus and adapts the microphone array to prioritize sound sources aligned with that focus, even *before* verbal cues are given.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-density microphone array (64+ elements) with individually controllable gain and phase.
    *   Non-invasive biofeedback sensor (EEG headset or wearable HRV monitor).
    *   High-performance processor with dedicated DSP capabilities.
    *   Low-latency communication bus between sensors, processor, and actuator (for physical array steering).

*   **Software:**
    *   **Biofeedback Signal Processing Module:**
        *   Real-time acquisition and preprocessing of biofeedback data (noise filtering, artifact removal).
        *   Feature extraction: Identify relevant biofeedback features indicative of user attention (e.g., alpha/theta band power in EEG, HRV coherence).
        *   Attention State Estimation: Machine learning model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model, LSTM) to estimate the user’s current attentional state (focused, distracted, relaxed).
    *   **Adaptive Beamforming Engine:**
        *   Traditional beamforming algorithms (Delay-and-Sum, MVDR, MUSIC) as a baseline.
        *   **Attentional Weighting:** Incorporate the estimated attention state as a weighting factor in the beamforming algorithm. Higher attention scores prioritize sound sources predicted to align with the user’s focus.
        *   **Predictive Beam Steering:** Utilize time-series analysis of biofeedback data to *predict* shifts in user attention and proactively steer the acoustic beam *before* a verbal cue is given.
        *   **Dynamic Variance Adjustment**: Utilize the biofeedback data to influence the variance calculation of sound direction values, as detailed in the patent, to provide increased accuracy for preferred directions.
    *   **Calibration & Training Module:**
        *   User-specific calibration to establish a baseline relationship between biofeedback signals and attentional states.
        *   Adaptive learning algorithms to refine the attentional weighting and predictive beam steering models over time.

*   **Pseudocode (Attentional Weighting):**

```
// Input: Sound data from microphone array, Biofeedback data, Attention State Estimate
// Output: Enhanced sound signal with prioritized direction

function enhance_sound(sound_data, biofeedback_data, attention_state) {

  // Calculate sound direction values and variances (as per patent)
  [sound_directions, sound_variances] = calculate_sound_direction(sound_data)

  // Calculate attentional weights based on attention state
  attentional_weight = map(attention_state, 0, 1, 0.1, 1.0) // Map attention to weight range

  // Apply attentional weight to sound variances
  weighted_variances = [v * (1 - attentional_weight) + attentional_weight * 0.01 for v in sound_variances] //Reduce variance for perceived direction

  // Recalculate direction data based on weighted variances
  enhanced_direction_data = calculate_direction(sound_directions, weighted_variances)

  return enhanced_direction_data
}
```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Hands-free control of smart devices.
    *   Immersive audio experiences (VR/AR).
    *   Assistive technology for individuals with cognitive impairments.
    *   Enhanced conferencing/communication systems.
