## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning with Multi-Speaker Mesh

**Concept:** Expand the speakerâ€™s provisioning and connection functionality to facilitate the creation of dynamically configurable acoustic zones within a space. This isn't just about *connecting* devices, but orchestrating them into a cohesive, adaptable sound system.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Each speaker unit (including the provisioning speaker) contains an additional, short-range RF transceiver (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy, Zigbee) alongside existing Wi-Fi/Wireless capabilities.
    *   Microphone array (minimum 2, optimally 4) integrated into each speaker for basic sound source localization and environmental noise assessment.
    *   Processing unit capable of running basic beamforming and spatial audio algorithms.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Zone Definition Protocol:** A new protocol layer layered on top of existing Wi-Fi/Wireless protocols that allows speakers to self-discover and form ad-hoc mesh networks specifically for audio zoning.
    *   **Dynamic Zoning Algorithm:** Algorithm residing on a central controller (e.g., a smartphone app, dedicated hub) or distributed across speakers. Takes input from microphone arrays to identify sound sources, assess room acoustics, and dynamically adjust speaker groupings and audio output levels to create targeted acoustic zones.
    *   **User Interface:** App allowing users to define preferred zoning configurations, set zone-specific audio profiles (EQ, volume limits), and trigger automated zoning based on detected events (e.g., voice commands, TV activation).
    *   **Provisioning Extension:** The initial provisioning beacon signal includes information about acoustic zoning capabilities and a discovery flag to signal availability to other speakers.
*   **Operation:**

    1.  **Discovery & Mesh Formation:** Speakers broadcast acoustic zoning discovery signals. Upon detection, they negotiate mesh network formation.
    2.  **Calibration:**  A calibration routine (initiated via the app) runs on all speakers in the mesh. This involves playing test tones and using the microphone arrays to measure sound propagation and create an acoustic map of the space.
    3.  **Zoning Control:** The user defines zones within the app. Zones can be geometric shapes (e.g., rectangles, circles) or based on identified objects (e.g., "living room seating area").
    4.  **Audio Routing:**  Audio signals are routed to the appropriate speakers based on the defined zones and the identified sound source.  If the sound source is ambiguous (e.g., multiple people speaking), the algorithm attempts to prioritize based on user preferences or sound source direction.
    5.  **Adaptive Adjustment:** The algorithm continuously monitors the room acoustics and adjusts speaker volumes, equalization settings, and beamforming parameters to optimize sound quality within each zone.

*   **Pseudocode (Dynamic Zone Adjustment):**

```
FUNCTION adjustZones(soundSourceData, roomAcoustics)

    // soundSourceData contains location, volume, frequency characteristics of sound source
    // roomAcoustics contains data on reflections, reverb, and background noise

    FOR EACH zone IN activeZones:
        IF soundSourceData.location IS within zone.bounds:
            zone.volume = calculateOptimalVolume(soundSourceData.volume, zone.size, roomAcoustics.reverb)
            zone.EQ = applyEQ(soundSourceData.frequencyCharacteristics, roomAcoustics.reflections)
            zone.beamformingDirection = pointTowards(soundSourceData.location)
        ELSE:
            zone.volume = minimumVolume // Reduce volume for zones not currently targeted
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Apply changes to speaker outputs
END FUNCTION
```

*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   Integration with voice assistants for hands-free zone control.
    *   Support for multiple simultaneous sound sources and dynamic zone splitting.
    *   Machine learning algorithms to learn user preferences and automatically optimize zone configurations.
