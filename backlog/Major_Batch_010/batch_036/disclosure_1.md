**Adaptive Voltage Domain Partitioning with Dynamic PMIC Allocation**

**Concept:** Extend the multi-PMIC control scheme to dynamically re-partition voltage domains within the SoC and allocate PMICs to those domains *during runtime*, based on workload characteristics. This moves beyond static allocation to a more granular and efficient power delivery system.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   SoC with reconfigurable power gating/switching matrix for voltage domains. This matrix allows for physical re-assignment of logic blocks to different voltage rails.
    *   PMIC cluster: Minimum of three PMICs (scalable). Each PMIC capable of delivering multiple voltage rails, and with configurable output characteristics (voltage, current, slew rate).
    *   High-speed communication bus: Enhanced I2C or SPI interface between the SoC and all PMICs. Must support bi-directional communication with low latency. A dedicated hardware arbitration unit will be necessary for contention resolution.
    *   Real-time monitoring circuitry: Voltage, current, and temperature sensors integrated into both the SoC and each PMIC. Data streamed to a dedicated monitoring block within the SoC.
    *   Workload Profiler: Hardware-based unit within the SoC that monitors application behavior and identifies power-critical modules.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Runtime Power Manager:  Firmware module residing on the SoC, responsible for:
        *   Analyzing workload profile data.
        *   Determining optimal voltage domain partitioning.
        *   Reconfiguring the power gating matrix.
        *   Allocating PMICs to specific voltage domains.
        *   Setting voltage/current levels for each rail.
    *   PMIC Control Interface:  API allowing the Runtime Power Manager to control each PMIC.
    *   Fault Management System: Handles PMIC failures, over-current/over-voltage conditions, and thermal events. Includes redundancy mechanisms (e.g., failover to a secondary PMIC).
*   **Operational Flow:**

    1.  **Initialization:**  System boots with a default voltage domain configuration.
    2.  **Workload Monitoring:** Workload Profiler continuously monitors application behavior.
    3.  **Analysis & Partitioning:**  Runtime Power Manager analyzes workload data and determines an optimized voltage domain partitioning. Criteria include:
        *   Grouping modules with similar power requirements.
        *   Minimizing the number of voltage domains.
        *   Matching domain requirements to PMIC capabilities.
    4.  **Reconfiguration:**
        *   The power gating matrix is reconfigured to physically move modules between domains.
        *   PMIC assignments are updated in the Runtime Power Manager.
        *   The appropriate PMICs are commanded to provide the required voltages and currents.
    5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**  The process repeats continuously, adapting to changing workload characteristics.
    6.  **Fault Handling:** In case of PMIC failure, the Fault Management System automatically switches to a redundant PMIC.

**Pseudocode (Runtime Power Manager - Core Logic):**

```
function optimize_power_domains(workload_profile):
  domain_map = create_initial_domain_map()
  pmic_allocation = create_initial_pmic_allocation()

  for module in workload_profile.modules:
    best_domain = find_best_domain(module, domain_map)
    add_module_to_domain(module, best_domain, domain_map)

  for domain in domain_map:
    best_pmic = find_best_pmic(domain, pmic_allocation)
    allocate_pmic_to_domain(domain, best_pmic, pmic_allocation)

  reconfigure_power_gating(domain_map)
  configure_pmics(pmic_allocation)

function find_best_domain(module, domain_map):
  // Criteria: Minimize power leakage, match voltage/current requirements
  // Evaluate each domain based on module's power profile
  return best_domain

function find_best_pmic(domain, pmic_allocation):
  // Criteria: Capacity, available rails, efficiency
  // Evaluate available PMICs based on domain's requirements
  return best_pmic
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Predictive partitioning: Use machine learning to anticipate workload changes and pre-configure power domains.
*   Fine-grained voltage scaling: Dynamically adjust voltage levels within each domain based on module activity.
*   Adaptive clock gating: Combine voltage domain partitioning with clock gating to further reduce power consumption.
*   Integration with thermal management system: Optimize power delivery based on temperature sensors to prevent overheating.
