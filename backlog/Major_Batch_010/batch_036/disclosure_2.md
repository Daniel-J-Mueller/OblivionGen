## Adaptive Spatial Audio Reconstruction for Enhanced Howling Suppression

**Concept:** Leveraging multi-microphone arrays and spatial audio reconstruction to proactively *remove* feedback sources from the audio stream *before* they manifest as howling, rather than reactively attenuating specific frequency bands. This builds on the idea of frequency-based attenuation but moves to a spatial domain solution.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum of 4, optimally 8 or more, omnidirectional microphones arranged in a circular or hexagonal pattern. Microphone spacing will determine the frequencies effectively localized.
*   **Audio Interface:** High-quality audio interface with sufficient channels to accommodate the microphone array. Low latency is critical.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated DSP or high-performance CPU/GPU for real-time audio processing.

**II. Software/Algorithm Core:**

1.  **Beamforming & Source Localization:** Implement a beamforming algorithm (e.g., Delay-and-Sum, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response - MVDR) to steer “listening beams” across the acoustic space.  The algorithm will identify potential feedback sources (e.g., speakers) by detecting strong correlated signals arriving from specific directions.

    *   *Pseudocode:*

        ```
        For each direction (theta, phi):
          Calculate time delays for each microphone based on direction and speed of sound
          Sum the signals from each microphone after applying the calculated delays
          Calculate signal power for the direction
        End For
        Identify directions with signal power exceeding a threshold as potential sources
        ```
2.  **Spatial Audio Reconstruction:** For identified feedback sources, reconstruct the audio signal *originating* from that source using spatial filtering and source separation techniques (e.g., Independent Component Analysis - ICA, Non-negative Matrix Factorization - NMF). The goal is to isolate the sound *before* it enters the feedback loop.

    *   *Pseudocode:*

        ```
        For each identified source:
          Apply ICA or NMF to separate the source's signal from the mixed audio
          Reconstruct the isolated source signal
        End For
        ```

3.  **Feedback Cancellation & Dynamic Masking:** Create a “spatial mask” that represents the areas in space where potential feedback is occurring. Subtract the reconstructed feedback signal from the original mixed signal *before* processing for output. This eliminates the feedback source *before* amplification. Implement dynamic masking of specific spatial areas.  If a region consistently produces feedback, the mask becomes more aggressive.

    *   *Pseudocode:*

        ```
        Output_Signal = Original_Signal - Reconstructed_Feedback_Signal
        For each spatial region:
          If Feedback_Detected:
            Increase Mask_Intensity
          End If
        End For
        Apply Mask to Output_Signal
        ```

4.  **Adaptive Learning & Noise Reduction:** Incorporate a machine learning component to adapt the beamforming and spatial reconstruction algorithms based on the acoustic environment.  Use a noise reduction algorithm (e.g., spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering) to improve the clarity of the reconstructed signal and reduce the impact of ambient noise.

**III. System Parameters:**

*   **Microphone Array Geometry:** Defined by microphone positions.
*   **Sampling Rate:** Minimum 44.1 kHz, higher for improved accuracy.
*   **Beamforming Resolution:** Determines the precision of source localization.
*   **Masking Threshold:** Controls the aggressiveness of the spatial mask.
*   **Learning Rate:** Controls the speed of adaptation.
*   **Noise Reduction Parameters:** Configured based on the specific noise environment.

**IV. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Head Tracking:** Integrate head tracking to dynamically adjust the spatial mask based on the listener's position.
*   **Acoustic Modeling:** Create an acoustic model of the environment to improve source localization and spatial reconstruction accuracy.
*   **Multi-Channel Support:** Extend the system to support multiple speakers and microphones for larger spaces.
