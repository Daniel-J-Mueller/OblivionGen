## Dynamic Feature Weighting via Simulated Annealing

**Concept:** Extend the feature contribution analysis to incorporate a simulated annealing optimization process. Instead of *selecting* a new subset of features, dynamically adjust the *weights* assigned to each feature *during* retraining. This aims for finer-grained control over risk score estimation and potentially better performance than simply switching feature subsets.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Module:** 'FeatureWeightOptimizer'
*   **Inputs:**
    *   `data_objects`: Set of data objects with features.
    *   `initial_weights`: A vector of initial weights, one for each feature (e.g., uniform distribution, or based on initial feature importance from a preliminary model).
    *   `risk_scores`: Existing (possibly inaccurate) risk scores for a training set.
    *   `model`: Trained random forest regressor (or classifier).
    *   `annealing_schedule`: Parameters controlling the simulated annealing process:
        *   `initial_temperature`: Starting temperature.
        *   `cooling_rate`: Rate at which temperature decreases.
        *   `num_iterations`: Number of iterations at each temperature.
        *   `perturbation_magnitude`: Max change allowed for a feature weight.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   `optimized_weights`: A vector of optimized feature weights.
    *   `retrained_model`: Retrained random forest regressor (or classifier) using optimized weights.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function optimize_feature_weights(data_objects, initial_weights, risk_scores, model, annealing_schedule):

    current_weights = initial_weights
    current_energy = calculate_energy(risk_scores, model, data_objects, current_weights) # Energy = error metric
    best_weights = current_weights
    best_energy = current_energy

    temperature = annealing_schedule.initial_temperature

    while temperature > 0.001: # Stopping criteria

        for i in range(annealing_schedule.num_iterations):
            # Perturb current weights
            new_weights = current_weights + random.uniform(-annealing_schedule.perturbation_magnitude, annealing_schedule.perturbation_magnitude)

            # Ensure weights are non-negative (optional constraint)
            new_weights = max(0, new_weights)

            # Retrain model with new weights
            retrained_model = retrain_model(data_objects, new_weights)

            # Calculate new energy
            new_energy = calculate_energy(risk_scores, retrained_model, data_objects, new_weights)

            # Acceptance probability
            if new_energy < current_energy:
                current_weights = new_weights
                current_energy = new_energy
            else:
                acceptance_probability = math.exp((current_energy - new_energy) / temperature)
                if random.random() < acceptance_probability:
                    current_weights = new_weights
                    current_energy = new_energy

            if current_energy < best_energy:
                best_energy = current_energy
                best_weights = current_weights

        temperature *= annealing_schedule.cooling_rate

    return best_weights, retrain_model(data_objects, best_weights)


function calculate_energy(risk_scores, model, data_objects, weights):
    # Predict risk scores using the model and weights.
    predicted_scores = model.predict(data_objects, weights)
    # Calculate an error metric (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error).
    error = mean_squared_error(risk_scores, predicted_scores)
    return error
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Weight Constraints:**  Implement constraints to prevent individual weights from becoming excessively large or small.
*   **Parallelization:** Parallelize the retraining process to reduce the computational cost.
*   **Adaptive Perturbation Magnitude:** Adjust the perturbation magnitude based on the current temperature and the success rate of weight changes.
*   **Visualization Integration:** Extend the visualization to display the optimized feature weights, providing insights into the most important features for risk estimation.
*   **Automated Scheduling:** Allow for automated optimization of the `annealing_schedule` parameters using techniques like Bayesian optimization.
