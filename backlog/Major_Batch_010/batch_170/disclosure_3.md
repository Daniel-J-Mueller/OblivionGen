**Distributed Key Orchestration with Temporal Decay**

**Concept:** Extend the key provisioning system to operate as a decentralized, time-sensitive orchestration service. Instead of solely programming keys into devices, the system manages a distributed ledger of key lifetimes and authorizes access based on temporal validity and device attestation.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Key Ledger:**
    *   A blockchain-inspired distributed ledger stores key metadata: key ID, algorithm, creation timestamp, expiration timestamp, authorized device list (identified by hardware fingerprints), access policies (e.g., permitted operations).
    *   Ledger entries are cryptographically signed by a root of trust (e.g., a hardware security module).
    *   Ledger is replicated across a network of secure nodes.

2.  **Device Attestation Module:**
    *   Each device incorporates a secure enclave (e.g., Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone) responsible for device attestation.
    *   Upon boot, the device generates an attestation report (signed by the enclave) containing device hardware fingerprints, software version, and cryptographic commitments to its current state.
    *   The attestation report is submitted to the Key Orchestration Service (KOS).

3.  **Key Orchestration Service (KOS):**
    *   Verifies device attestation reports against a list of trusted devices.
    *   Upon successful attestation, KOS checks the key ledger for valid keys authorized for the requesting device.
    *   KOS provides temporary key access tokens. These tokens include expiration times and usage restrictions.

4.  **Temporal Decay Mechanism:**
    *   Keys are assigned expiration timestamps.
    *   Prior to expiration, the KOS can issue renewal tokens.
    *   Upon expiration, KOS revokes access to the key.
    *   Automatic key rotation: The system facilitates automated key rotation cycles, issuing new keys before old ones expire.

5.  **Ephemeral Key Generation:**
    *   KOS can generate ephemeral (short-lived) keys on demand, for specific, limited-time operations.
    *   Ephemeral keys are never stored persistently on devices.

6.  **Pseudocode (Key Access Request):**

```
// Device initiates key access request
device_id = get_device_id()
attestation_report = generate_attestation_report()
request_data = { "device_id": device_id, "attestation_report": attestation_report, "key_id": requested_key_id }
send_request_to_KOS(request_data)

// KOS receives request
verify_attestation_report(attestation_report)
if (attestation_valid):
    key_metadata = get_key_metadata(requested_key_id)
    if (key_authorized_for_device(key_metadata, device_id)):
        if (key_not_expired(key_metadata)):
            generate_access_token(key_metadata)
            send_access_token_to_device()
        else:
            send_error_message("Key expired")
    else:
        send_error_message("Device not authorized")
else:
    send_error_message("Attestation failed")
```

7. **Hardware Requirements:**

*   Devices: Secure Enclave (Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone)
*   KOS Nodes: HSM (Hardware Security Module) for cryptographic signing

8.  **Network Topology:**

*   KOS nodes are distributed geographically for high availability.
*   Communication between devices and KOS nodes is secured using TLS 1.3 or higher.
