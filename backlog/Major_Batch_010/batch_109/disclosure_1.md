**Adaptive Mesh Network Resource Allocation via Predictive Multicast**

**System Overview:**

This system extends the concept of hop-aware multicast by introducing *predictive* multicast groups, dynamically adjusting multicast scope *before* a request is even broadcast. The goal is to minimize latency and bandwidth usage by pre-positioning resources (data, processing) closer to predicted demand.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Demand Prediction Engine (DPE):** A distributed machine learning model running on mesh network nodes. The DPE analyzes historical request data, user location (if available), time of day, and potentially external data feeds (e.g., weather, events) to *predict* future resource demand within specific mesh network zones.  It outputs probability distributions for resource requests across zones.

2.  **Proactive Multicast Group Manager (PMGM):**  This component, also distributed, uses the DPE’s predictions to proactively create and maintain *tiered* multicast groups.  Instead of a single TTL-based multicast, there are multiple groups with different scopes (TTL equivalents).

    *   **Tier 1 (Local):** Smallest scope, covering immediate neighbors.
    *   **Tier 2 (Regional):** Medium scope, covering a broader zone.
    *   **Tier 3 (Global):** Largest scope, encompassing the entire mesh network.

    The PMGM adjusts the membership of these tiers *before* a request is initiated, based on predicted demand.  Nodes are assigned to tiers based on the probability of needing the resource.

3.  **Adaptive Request Routing (ARR):** When a node initiates a request, the ARR component first consults the PMGM to determine the optimal multicast tier to use. It *does not* immediately broadcast to all nodes.  Instead, it initiates a multicast only within the predicted demand zone.

4.  **Feedback Loop:**  Nodes receiving a multicast provide feedback on whether they actually needed the resource. This feedback is used to refine the DPE’s predictions and the PMGM’s group assignments.

**Pseudocode (ARR - Adaptive Request Routing):**

```
function initiateRequest(resourceID):
  // Get predicted demand zone from PMGM
  demandZone = PMGM.getDemandZone(resourceID, myLocation)

  //Determine Tier
  if demandZone == "Local":
    multicastTier = 1
  else if demandZone == "Regional":
    multicastTier = 2
  else:
    multicastTier = 3

  //Initiate Multicast
  multicast(resourceID, multicastTier)

  //Listen for responses and process
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Demand Prediction Table:**  A distributed table storing predicted resource demand probabilities for each mesh network zone.
*   **Multicast Group Membership List:** A distributed list specifying which nodes belong to each multicast tier.
*   **Node Location Database:** (Optional) A database storing the physical location of mesh network nodes.

**Novelty & Potential:**

This system moves beyond reactive multicast by *proactively* shaping the multicast scope based on prediction. The tiered approach allows for finer-grained control over bandwidth usage and latency.  The feedback loop ensures the system adapts to changing demand patterns. The distributed nature of the components enhances scalability and resilience.
