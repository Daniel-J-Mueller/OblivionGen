## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System – Impact Localization & Severity

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple impact *detection* to provide localized haptic feedback mirroring the impact force and location on the device itself. This allows a user to intuitively understand *where* and *how hard* the device was hit, aiding in damage assessment and potentially triggering preventative measures.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Haptic Actuator Grid:** Integrate an array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric, shape memory alloys, or electro-rheological fluids) embedded *within* the device chassis – ideally behind the display and on the rear surface. Density: 25 actuators per 100mm<sup>2</sup>.  Actuators must have a response time of <5ms and support force modulation from 0-5N.
*   **IMU Integration:** Enhance the existing IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) with higher sensitivity and sampling rates (minimum 1kHz) to capture more nuanced impact data.
*   **Dedicated Processing Core:** Implement a low-power co-processor (ARM Cortex-M7 class) dedicated to real-time impact analysis and haptic control.
*   **Force Sensing Layer:** Add a transparent, flexible force sensing layer *underneath* the display to detect localized pressure changes resulting from impact. Resolution: 1mm<sup>2</sup>.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Impact Mapping Algorithm:**
    *   **Input:** Raw IMU data, force sensor data, and camera misalignment data (from the existing patent).
    *   **Process:**  Utilize a Kalman filter to fuse data from all three sources, creating a 3D impact map representing the force vector and point of impact. This map must account for device orientation and impact surface material (estimated through camera image analysis).
    *   **Output:** A spatial force distribution map.
*   **Haptic Feedback Control:**
    *   **Input:** Spatial force distribution map.
    *   **Process:**  Develop an algorithm to translate the force distribution map into individual actuator control signals. This algorithm should incorporate:
        *   **Force Scaling:** Map the impact force to a manageable haptic range.
        *   **Spatial Localization:**  Activate actuators corresponding to the impact location with varying intensity.
        *   **Damping/Resonance Control:**  Adjust actuator timing to prevent unwanted resonance or oscillation.
    *   **Output:**  Control signals for each haptic actuator.
*   **Damage Assessment Module:**
    *   **Input:** Impact force, location, device material properties, estimated damage models.
    *   **Process:** Employ a physics-based simulation (finite element analysis) to estimate potential structural damage based on the impact event.
    *   **Output:** Damage severity report (e.g., "Minor cosmetic damage," "Possible screen crack," "Critical structural failure").

**3. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Baseline Calibration:**  Upon device startup, the system performs a self-calibration routine to map actuator positions and response characteristics.
2.  **Impact Detection:**  The IMU and camera misalignment data continuously monitor for impact events.
3.  **Impact Analysis:**  Upon detection, the impact mapping algorithm analyzes the event to determine the force vector, impact location, and potential damage.
4.  **Haptic Feedback:**  The haptic feedback control module activates the appropriate actuators, providing localized haptic feedback to the user.
5.  **Damage Reporting:**  The damage assessment module generates a damage report and displays it on the screen.
6.  **Preventative Measures:** Based on damage assessment, the system can suggest preventative measures (e.g., "Back up your data immediately").

**Pseudocode – Haptic Feedback Control Module:**

```
function generateHapticFeedback(forceMap):
  for each actuator in actuatorGrid:
    force = forceMap.getForceAtActuator(actuator)
    if force > 0:
      actuator.setForce(min(force, maxForce))
    else:
      actuator.setForce(0)
  end
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Material-Aware Haptics:** Integrate machine learning to identify the material of the impacting surface and adjust haptic feedback accordingly.
*   **Personalized Haptic Profiles:** Allow users to customize the intensity and characteristics of haptic feedback.
*   **Proactive Damage Control:**  Use haptic feedback to guide users on how to mitigate potential damage (e.g., "Gently press here to realign the screen").
