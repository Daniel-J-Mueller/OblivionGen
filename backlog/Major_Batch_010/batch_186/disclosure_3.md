## Dynamic Catalog Field Weighting Based on User "Journey" Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the existing intent-aware recommendation system by dynamically adjusting the weights assigned to catalog fields *during* a user's browsing session, based on a predicted "journey" or completion path. This anticipates *where* the user is likely headed within the catalog, refining recommendations beyond initial query intent.

**Specifications:**

**1. Journey Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** User’s search query, historical interaction data (clicks, purchases, time spent on pages), current page context (category, item details).
*   **Model:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Transformer architecture. Trained on aggregated user behavior data to predict the next likely catalog category/item the user will interact with. Output is a probability distribution over possible “journey stages” (e.g., ‘initial search’, ‘comparison shopping’, ‘detail review’, ‘add to cart’, ‘checkout’).
*   **Output:** A vector representing the probability distribution over journey stages.

**2. Dynamic Catalog Field Weighting:**

*   **Input:** Journey stage probabilities (from Journey Prediction Module), initial catalog field weights (derived from initial search query/intent).
*   **Process:**
    *   A lookup table defines "relevance scores" for each catalog field *within each journey stage*.  For example:
        *   In the "comparison shopping" stage, fields like ‘price’, ‘rating’, ‘features’ receive high relevance scores.
        *   In the "detail review" stage, ‘material’, ‘warranty’, ‘shipping options’ receive higher scores.
        *   In the “add to cart” stage, “size”, “color”, “quantity” are heavily weighted.
    *   A weighted average is calculated to combine the initial weights with the relevance scores from the lookup table, factoring in the journey stage probabilities.
    *   The new, dynamically adjusted weights are applied to the recommendation and filtering algorithms.
*   **Output:** A vector of dynamically weighted catalog fields.

**3. Recommendation/Filtering Engine Modifications:**

*   The existing recommendation engine is modified to accept the dynamically weighted catalog field vector as input.
*   Recommendation scores are adjusted based on these weights.  Items matching highly weighted fields receive a score boost.
*   Filtering algorithms prioritize items matching highly weighted fields, more aggressively removing items that do not.

**4. System Architecture Additions:**

*   **Journey Prediction Service:** A dedicated microservice responsible for running the Journey Prediction Module and providing journey stage probabilities.
*   **Catalog Field Weighting Service:** A dedicated microservice responsible for applying the dynamic weighting logic.

**Pseudocode (Catalog Field Weighting Service):**

```
function calculate_dynamic_weights(initial_weights, journey_stage_probabilities, relevance_score_lookup):
  dynamic_weights = []
  for i in range(length(initial_weights)):
    weight = (initial_weights[i] * 0.6) + (relevance_score_lookup[journey_stage][i] * 0.4)
    dynamic_weights.append(weight)
  return dynamic_weights
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Detailed user interaction logs (clicks, purchases, time spent on pages, search queries).
*   Manually curated relevance score lookup table defining field importance per journey stage.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved recommendation accuracy.
*   More relevant search results.
*   Increased user engagement.
*   Potentially, increased conversion rates.
*   Supports more proactive and helpful product discovery.
