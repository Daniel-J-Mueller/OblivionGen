## Adaptive Resource Quotas with Predictive Scaling

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting resource quotas for sub-accounts based on predicted utilization, learned from historical data and real-time monitoring.

**Core Concept:** Instead of static quotas, a sub-account's resource availability fluctuates within a defined band, optimized for cost and performance. The system anticipates needs and proactively scales resource allocations *before* bottlenecks occur.

**Components:**

1.  **Historical Data Collector:** Logs resource utilization (CPU, memory, storage, network) for each sub-account over time. This data is time-series based.
2.  **Predictive Analytics Engine:** Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, regression) to predict future resource needs for each sub-account. Inputs include:
    *   Historical utilization data.
    *   Scheduled tasks/events within the sub-account.
    *   External factors (e.g., time of day, day of week, seasonality).
3.  **Quota Adjustment Module:**  Modifies the resource quota for each sub-account based on the predictions from the Predictive Analytics Engine.  The module operates within predefined safety margins.
    *   **Proactive Scaling:**  Increases the quota *before* predicted utilization reaches the current limit.
    *   **Reactive Scaling:**  Decreases the quota if predicted utilization consistently falls below a threshold, optimizing cost.
    *   **Dynamic Band:**  Allows quotas to fluctuate within a defined range (e.g., +/- 20% of the baseline).
4.  **Anomaly Detection:**  Identifies unusual resource usage patterns that may indicate a problem or security breach.  Triggers alerts and potential automated responses.
5.  **User Interface:** Provides administrators with visibility into quota predictions, adjustments, and historical utilization data.  Allows for manual overrides and configuration of scaling parameters.
6.  **API Integration:** Enables external systems to access and influence quota adjustments.

**Pseudocode (Quota Adjustment Module):**

```
function adjustQuota(subAccountId, predictedUtilization, currentQuota, baselineQuota, safetyMargin):
    if predictedUtilization > currentQuota:
        newQuota = min(baselineQuota * (1 + safetyMargin), predictedUtilization * 1.2)  //Scale up
        applyQuota(subAccountId, newQuota)
    else if predictedUtilization < currentQuota * 0.8: //Utilization consistently low
        newQuota = max(baselineQuota * 0.8, predictedUtilization * 1.1) //Scale down
        applyQuota(subAccountId, newQuota)
    else:
        //Maintain current quota
        pass

function applyQuota(subAccountId, newQuota):
    //Update data store with new quota for subAccountId
    //Notify relevant services (e.g., resource scheduler)
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-Tenancy Support:** Allow different scaling policies to be applied to different sub-accounts.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Integrate with cloud provider pricing models to minimize resource costs.
*   **Automated Remediation:**  Automatically trigger scaling actions based on predefined thresholds.
*   **Integration with Billing System:**  Automatically adjust billing based on actual resource usage.
*   **"Burst" Capacity:**  Allow sub-accounts to temporarily exceed their quotas during peak demand (with associated overage charges).
