## Dynamic Contextual Item Insertion & Narrative Branching

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple item display alongside video to actively integrate items *into* the video narrative, creating branching storylines dependent on user interaction with those items.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A "Narrative Engine" operating on the server-side. This engine manages video segment variations and branching logic.
*   **Segment Library:** Pre-recorded video segments, each representing a different narrative path or a variation of a scene incorporating different item placements/references. Segments are tagged with metadata:
    *   `item_id`:  The product being referenced/featured.
    *   `branch_point`: Boolean flag indicating if this segment is a decision point.
    *   `trigger_event`:  Event that initiates the segment (e.g., `item_selected`, `time_elapsed`).
    *   `next_segments`: List of potential next segments based on user interaction.
*   **Client-Side Integration:** Client SDK receives manifest data *including* segment metadata. Client SDK tracks video playback position and sends interaction events (item selections, etc.) to the server.
*   **Real-Time Segment Selection:** The server's Narrative Engine receives interaction events. Based on these events, it selects the appropriate next video segment from the Segment Library.
*   **Seamless Transition:** Client SDK receives a URL for the selected segment. This segment is streamed seamlessly alongside the current video, creating a fluid, branching experience.
*   **Dynamic Item Placement:**  Segments may include CGI overlays or visual effects to *place* the selected item within the video scene (e.g., a character using the product, the product appearing in the background).

**Pseudocode (Server-Side - Narrative Engine):**

```
function select_next_segment(current_segment_id, user_event):
    segment_metadata = get_segment_metadata(current_segment_id)
    if segment_metadata.branch_point:
        if user_event.type == "item_selected":
            next_segment_id = find_next_segment(segment_metadata.next_segments, user_event.item_id)
            if next_segment_id is null:
                # Default to first segment in list if item ID doesn't match
                next_segment_id = segment_metadata.next_segments[0]
        else:
            next_segment_id = segment_metadata.next_segments[0] #Default to first
    else:
        next_segment_id = segment_metadata.next_segments[0] #Linear progression

    return next_segment_id
```

**Client-Side Interaction Flow:**

1.  Client receives initial manifest and first segment URL.
2.  Client streams segment and displays interactive items.
3.  User selects an item.
4.  Client sends `item_selected` event with `item_id` to server.
5.  Server's Narrative Engine selects next segment.
6.  Server sends URL for next segment.
7.  Client seamlessly transitions to the new segment, updates interactive items, and repeats from step 3.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Interactive cooking shows where viewers choose ingredients and influence the recipe.
*   "Choose Your Own Adventure"-style product demonstrations.
*   Personalized educational content that adapts to user responses.
*   Brand storytelling with branching narratives based on viewer preferences.
