## Adaptive Acoustic Feature Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Enhance ASR performance in noisy or variable acoustic environments by dynamically weighting different acoustic features during AFE processing, guided by a reinforcement learning agent. The existing patent focuses on transmitting *differences* in feature vectors to reduce bandwidth. This expands on that concept by *altering* the features themselves, adapting to the incoming audio stream in real-time.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Raw audio stream (sampled at a standard rate – e.g., 16kHz).
*   **AFE Modules:** Standard AFE pipeline including pre-emphasis, framing, windowing, FFT, and feature extraction (MFCCs, PLP, or learned feature vectors).  The existing AFE modules remain largely unchanged – the innovation lies *before* and *after* this stage.
*   **Feature Vector Set:** Standard feature vector set (e.g., 13 MFCCs + delta + delta-delta). This is the primary data manipulated.
*   **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** A deep Q-network (DQN) or Policy Gradient agent.
    *   **State:** The current feature vector (normalized). Potentially include a history of previous feature vectors.
    *   **Action:** A set of weighting coefficients (one for each feature in the vector). These coefficients will scale the individual features. The weighting range is between 0 and 1.
    *   **Reward:** A measure of ASR accuracy improvement. This can be derived from a confidence score from the speech recognition engine, or a secondary “ground truth” ASR run with higher computational resources.
    *   **Training:** The agent is trained *offline* using a diverse dataset of speech and noise conditions.  Fine-tuning may be performed *online* during deployment.
*   **Weighting Layer:** A layer inserted *before* the final feature vector output. This layer multiplies each feature by the corresponding weight from the RL agent.
*   **Output:** Weighted feature vector.

**Pseudocode:**

```
# Offline Training Phase
FOR epoch IN range(num_epochs):
  FOR episode IN range(num_episodes):
    state = get_initial_state()
    done = False

    WHILE not done:
      action = agent.select_action(state) # Get weighting coefficients
      weighted_features = state * action  # Apply weights
      reward = calculate_reward(weighted_features, ground_truth)
      agent.update(state, action, reward)
      state = next_state()

# Online Deployment Phase
WHILE True:
  audio_frame = get_audio_frame()
  features = extract_features(audio_frame) # Standard AFE pipeline
  action = agent.select_action(features)
  weighted_features = features * action
  asr_output = speech_recognition_engine(weighted_features)
  output_asr_output
```

**Refinements:**

*   **Contextual Awareness:** The state could include contextual information, such as the speaker’s identity (if known), environment type (e.g., car, office), or time of day.
*   **Hierarchical RL:** A hierarchical RL agent could learn to adjust higher-level AFE parameters (e.g., window size, filterbank parameters) in addition to feature weights.
*   **Federated Learning:** The RL agent could be trained in a federated learning manner, allowing multiple devices to contribute to the training process without sharing raw audio data.
*   **Adversarial Training:** An adversarial network could be used to generate challenging noise conditions during training, improving the robustness of the RL agent.
