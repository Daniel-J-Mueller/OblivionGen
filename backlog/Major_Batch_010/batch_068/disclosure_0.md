## Dynamic AR Object Reconstruction & Swarm Interaction

**Concept:** Leveraging the object recognition and AR presentation framework of the base patent, create a system where multiple users can collaboratively *reconstruct* virtual objects within the AR environment by physically manipulating tagged objects. Think digital LEGOs, but the "bricks" are real-world objects with AR overlays.

**System Specs:**

*   **Tagged Object Types:** Objects are tagged with unique identifiers (QR codes, AR markers, RFID, etc.).  Each object has associated 3D model data *fragments* stored server-side. These fragments represent portions of a larger, potential virtual object.
*   **User Device Requirements:**  Standard AR capable device (smartphone, tablet, AR glasses) with camera and internet connectivity.
*   **Server-Side Component:**  A centralized server managing object fragment database, user sessions, object reconstruction progress, and multi-user synchronization.
*   **Object Interaction Workflow:**
    1.  User scans a tagged object with their device.
    2.  Device identifies the object and requests its corresponding 3D fragment from the server.
    3.  Server transmits the fragment.
    4.  Device renders the fragment in AR, anchored to the physical object.
    5.  Multiple users can scan and manipulate different tagged objects.
    6.  The server monitors the spatial relationships between the physical objects (via AR tracking data from user devices).
    7.  As users arrange the physical objects in a specific configuration (determined by a pre-defined "blueprint" for the virtual object), the server begins to *assemble* the full virtual object in AR.
    8.  The assembled virtual object is rendered on all participating user devices, synchronized in real-time.
*   **Blueprint System:**  Pre-defined blueprints specify:
    *   The required set of tagged objects.
    *   The spatial arrangement of objects needed to complete the virtual object.
    *   The final virtual object’s 3D model.
*   **Swarm Interaction Mode:**
    *   Objects can be 'claimed' by a user through a device interface.
    *   Claimed objects are visually highlighted in the AR environment.
    *   Users can 'donate' objects by relinquishing control.
    *   A ‘swarm intelligence’ algorithm prioritizes completion of missing object segments and prompts for donations.
*   **Pseudocode (Server-Side – Object Assembly):**

```
function assembleObject(userSession, objectFragmentID, position, rotation):
  lock objectFragmentID
  add fragment to scene with position and rotation
  calculate completion progress
  if completion progress == 100%:
    unlock all fragments
    broadcast finished object to all users
  else:
    broadcast partial object update to all users
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Collaborative puzzle solving.
*   Educational building sets.
*   Interactive museum exhibits.
*   Team building exercises.
*   Virtual prototyping and design.
