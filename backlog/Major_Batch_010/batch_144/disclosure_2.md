## Aerial Vehicle Swarm Obstacle Mapping & Collective Descent

**Concept:** Expand obstacle detection beyond a single aerial vehicle to a swarm, leveraging collective data for more robust and detailed 3D mapping, and coordinating descent paths. This moves beyond *avoidance* to *collective navigation* through complex environments.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware:**

*   **Vehicle Quantity:** Minimum of 3, ideally 5-10 aerial vehicles per operation.
*   **Imaging System:** Each vehicle equipped with:
    *   Stereo Camera System: High-resolution, global shutter cameras with known baseline for depth calculation.
    *   LiDAR: Short-range LiDAR for fine-grained obstacle detection within 5-10 meters.
    *   IMU/GPS: Precise positioning and orientation data.
*   **Communication:** High-bandwidth, low-latency communication link between vehicles (e.g., 802.11ad or dedicated mesh network).  Range of at least 100 meters.
*   **Processing Unit:** Each vehicle equipped with an embedded system capable of running SLAM algorithms and data fusion. (Nvidia Jetson Orin NX or similar).

**II. Software/Algorithm:**

1.  **Distributed SLAM (D-SLAM):**
    *   Each vehicle performs local SLAM using stereo camera and LiDAR data.
    *   Vehicles share partial maps and pose estimates with neighboring vehicles.
    *   A central server (or distributed consensus algorithm) fuses partial maps into a global, consistent map of the environment.  Utilize a Kalman Filter or similar state estimator for map fusion.
2.  **Obstacle Classification & Severity Assessment:**
    *   Point cloud data (LiDAR + stereo depth) is segmented to identify potential obstacles.
    *   Obstacles are classified based on shape, size, and reflectivity. (e.g., wires, trees, buildings, moving objects).
    *   Assign a 'severity score' to each obstacle based on its potential risk to the swarm and the mission objective.
3.  **Collective Descent Planning:**
    *   A global path planner (e.g., RRT*, A*) generates a feasible path for the entire swarm based on the global map and obstacle information.
    *   Path is broken down into segments for each vehicle.
    *   Each vehicle's path is optimized for smooth flight and collision avoidance, taking into account the paths of other vehicles.
    *   Dynamic Replanning: Continuously monitor the environment and replan paths as needed to accommodate changes.
4.  **Swarm Coordination:**
    *   Vehicle roles: Designate a ‘lead’ vehicle for path planning and coordination, and ‘follower’ vehicles for maintaining formation and monitoring specific areas.
    *   Communication protocol: Implement a robust communication protocol for sharing map data, pose estimates, and path planning information.
    *   Collision Avoidance: Implement a decentralized collision avoidance system, where each vehicle monitors the proximity of other vehicles and adjusts its trajectory accordingly.

**III. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initialization:** Swarm vehicles deploy and establish communication.
2.  **Mapping Phase:** Vehicles explore the environment and build a 3D map using D-SLAM.
3.  **Obstacle Identification:**  Obstacles are identified, classified, and assigned severity scores.
4.  **Path Planning:** A collective descent path is planned based on the map and obstacle information.
5.  **Collective Descent:** Vehicles descend along the planned path, coordinating their movements to avoid obstacles and maintain formation.
6.  **Dynamic Replanning:** The system continuously monitors the environment and replans paths as needed.

**Pseudocode (Descent Planning):**

```
function planCollectiveDescent(globalMap, obstacles):
  globalPath = findPath(globalMap, startPoint, endPoint) // RRT* or A*
  segments = dividePath(globalPath, vehicleCount)
  for vehicle in vehicleCount:
    vehiclePath = assignSegment(segments, vehicle)
    optimizedPath = optimizePath(vehiclePath, obstacles, otherVehicles)
    assignPathToVehicle(vehicle, optimizedPath)
  return vehiclePaths

function optimizePath(path, obstacles, otherVehicles):
  // Incorporate obstacle avoidance and collision avoidance
  // Use potential fields or other optimization techniques
  // Ensure smooth flight and minimize energy consumption
  return optimizedPath
```

**Novelty:** The core novelty is the *collective* approach to mapping and descent, leveraging a swarm of vehicles to create a more robust and detailed understanding of the environment than a single vehicle could achieve.  This enables safe navigation through complex and unpredictable environments, where individual vehicles may be limited by sensor range or visibility.
