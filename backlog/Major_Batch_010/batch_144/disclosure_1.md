## Dynamic Key Sharding with Attestation

**Concept:** Instead of providing a single cryptographic key to a guest computing system, dynamically shard the key into multiple fragments. These fragments are then distributed across multiple virtual hardware devices *and* physically attested hardware components within the host system. Access requires a quorum of attested fragments, significantly increasing security.

**Specifications:**

*   **Key Sharding Engine:** A host-level component responsible for splitting the volume encryption key into *n* fragments using a Secret Sharing algorithm (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing). *n* is configurable based on a security policy.
*   **Fragment Holders:**
    *   **Virtual Hardware Devices (VHDs):**  Multiple VHDs are created and attached to the guest OS. Each VHD holds one or more key fragments.  These act as primary storage for fragments.
    *   **Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Fragments:** A portion of key fragments are sealed to the TPM of the host system, bound to a specific platform configuration (e.g., BIOS version, CPU model). This provides hardware-level protection and attestation.
    *   **Secure Enclave Fragments:** Utilize secure enclaves (e.g., Intel SGX, AMD SEV) to store and protect a subset of key fragments. This provides an isolated execution environment.
*   **Attestation Service:** A service responsible for verifying the integrity of the host system and the secure enclaves before releasing TPM or enclave-bound key fragments.  This involves remote attestation using established protocols.
*   **Key Reconstruction Proxy:** A component within the guest OS that acts as a proxy for key reconstruction. It requests fragments from the VHDs, TPM, and secure enclaves.
*   **Quorum Logic:** The Key Reconstruction Proxy enforces a quorum requirement.  It requires a minimum number of valid fragments (e.g., *k* out of *n*) to reconstruct the complete key.
*   **Dynamic Fragment Distribution:** The distribution of fragments across VHDs, TPM, and secure enclaves can be dynamically adjusted based on risk assessment and system load.
*   **Fragment Rotation:** Periodically rotate key fragments to further enhance security.

**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction Proxy):**

```
function reconstructKey():
  fragmentList = []

  // Retrieve fragments from VHDs
  for each vhd in vhdList:
    fragment = vhd.getFragment()
    if fragment.isValid():
      fragmentList.append(fragment)

  // Request fragments from TPM (requires attestation)
  if attestationService.verifyTPM():
    tpmFragment = attestationService.getTPMFragment()
    if tpmFragment.isValid():
      fragmentList.append(tpmFragment)

  // Request fragments from Secure Enclave (requires attestation)
  if attestationService.verifyEnclave():
    enclaveFragment = attestationService.getEnclaveFragment()
    if enclaveFragment.isValid():
      fragmentList.append(enclaveFragment)

  // Check if quorum is met
  if length(fragmentList) >= k:
    // Reconstruct the key using secret sharing algorithm
    key = reconstructKeyFromFragments(fragmentList)
    return key
  else:
    // Quorum not met.  Deny access.
    log("Quorum requirement not met. Access denied.")
    return null
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Fragment:**  Contains a portion of the encryption key, a digital signature, and metadata (e.g., source â€“ VHD, TPM, Enclave).
*   **Attestation Report:** Contains the results of the attestation process, including a verification status and a chain of trust.
