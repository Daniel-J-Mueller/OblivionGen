## Dynamic Resource Entanglement & Predictive Access

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic identity consolidation to proactively ‘entangle’ resource access based on predicted user needs *before* explicit requests are made, creating a ‘shadow’ identity that anticipates usage patterns.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Access Engine (PAE)
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Active Directory/Client Directory (as per existing patent)
    *   Resource Usage Logs (historical data of user access)
    *   Behavioral Analytics Engine (identifies usage patterns – time of day, resource combinations, correlations with other users)
    *   Calendar/Scheduling Data (optional – integrates with user schedules to predict resource needs)
*   **Functionality:**

    1.  **Baseline Profile Creation:** PAE constructs a baseline access profile for each user based on historical data.  This profile defines frequently accessed resources, typical access times, and common resource combinations.
    2.  **Predictive Modeling:**  PAE employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., time series analysis, collaborative filtering) to predict future resource access.  This generates a probability distribution of resources the user is *likely* to need.
    3.  **Shadow Identity Creation:** Based on the predictive model, PAE generates a “shadow identity” – a temporary identity pre-granted access to the most probable resources.  The access level can be tiered (e.g., read-only initially, escalating to full access if the user actually engages with the resource).
    4.  **Dynamic Entanglement:** The shadow identity is “entangled” with the user’s primary identity. When the user attempts to access a resource, the system first checks the shadow identity. If access is pre-granted, the request is immediately fulfilled.  If not, the system falls back to the existing authentication/authorization process (as per the original patent).
    5.  **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously monitors user behavior and refines the predictive model and shadow identity. Access patterns that deviate from predictions trigger adjustments to the model.
    6.  **Policy Governance:**  A policy engine governs the creation and lifespan of shadow identities.  Policies define maximum pre-grant access levels, acceptable prediction confidence thresholds, and expiration times.

*   **Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
function processUserLogin(userID):
    userProfile = getUserProfile(userID)
    predictedResources = predictResources(userProfile)
    shadowIdentity = createShadowIdentity(userID, predictedResources)
    entangleIdentities(userID, shadowIdentity)

function predictResources(userProfile):
    // Analyze historical data, behavioral patterns, calendar events
    resourceList = ML_Model.predict(userProfile) //Returns a list of Resources
    return resourceList

function createShadowIdentity(userID, resourceList):
    shadowID = generateUniqueID()
    for resource in resourceList:
        grantAccess(shadowID, resource, accessLevel)
    return shadowID

function entangleIdentities(userID, shadowID):
    //Logic to link UserID to ShadowID in authorization system
    //Upon Access Request:
    //Check for ShadowID association
    //If Found: Grant Access if authorized
    //If Not Found: Fallback to existing process
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:** Scalable compute infrastructure (cloud-based recommended) for machine learning model training and prediction.  Sufficient memory for storing user profiles and predictive models.

*   **Software Requirements:** Machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch), data analytics tools, authorization/authentication APIs.

*   **Security Considerations:**  Robust access control for managing the creation and modification of shadow identities.  Regular auditing of shadow identity usage.  Protection against malicious manipulation of predictive models.
