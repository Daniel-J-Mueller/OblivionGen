## Dynamic Data-Object Sharding with Temporal Encryption Keys

**Concept:** Expand on the large data object concept (specifically claim 4 referencing petabytes) by introducing dynamic sharding *combined* with temporal encryption keys, driven by real-time data access patterns. The goal is to maximize read/write performance while bolstering security by minimizing the lifespan of any single encryption key's exposure.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Object Sharding:**

*   **Initial Sharding:** The initial data object is divided into numerous shards (minimum 1024, scalable to millions). Shard size is adaptive, based on initial data analysis to predict access frequency.
*   **Dynamic Resharding:** A monitoring agent continuously analyzes data access patterns (read/write requests).  If access patterns shift significantly, the system initiates a resharding operation.  This is not a full copy/move – but a redistribution of *pointers* to the existing data.
*   **Access Pattern Metrics:** Track the following:
    *   Frequency of access to each shard.
    *   Time since last access to each shard.
    *   Type of access (read/write).
    *   User/application initiating the access.
*   **Resharding Trigger:** Resharding is triggered when the entropy of access pattern shifts beyond a defined threshold (configurable). Entropy is calculated based on access frequency distribution.
*   **Shard Metadata:** Each shard has associated metadata including:
    *   Shard ID.
    *   Current Encryption Key ID.
    *   Access Pattern Statistics (updated continuously).
    *   Last Modified Timestamp.

**2. Temporal Encryption Keys:**

*   **Key Generation:** Keys are generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG).
*   **Key Rotation:** Keys are rotated on a regular schedule *and* on-demand (e.g., after a shard has been accessed). Rotation frequency is configurable per shard.
*   **Key Encryption:** Keys are *themselves* encrypted using a master key (protected by hardware security module - HSM).
*   **Key Storage:**  Encrypted keys are stored in a distributed key management system (KMS).
*   **Key Versioning:** Each key rotation creates a new key version.  The KMS maintains a history of key versions.

**3. Encryption/Decryption Workflow:**

*   **Write Operation:**
    1.  Determine the target shard.
    2.  Obtain the *current* encryption key for that shard from the KMS.
    3.  Encrypt the data using the key.
    4.  Write the encrypted data to the shard.
    5.  Rotate the encryption key for that shard.
*   **Read Operation:**
    1.  Determine the target shard.
    2.  Obtain the latest *and* previous encryption key(s) for that shard from the KMS (maintain a small history – e.g., last 3 keys).
    3.  Attempt decryption with each key in the history.
    4.  If successful, return the decrypted data.  If all attempts fail, report an error.

**4. Pseudocode (Read Operation):**

```pseudocode
function readData(shardId, dataOffset, dataLength) {
  keyHistory = getKeyHistory(shardId); // Returns list of encrypted keys
  for (key in keyHistory) {
    decryptedKey = decryptKey(key);
    encryptedData = readFromShard(shardId, dataOffset, dataLength);
    decryptedData = decryptData(encryptedData, decryptedKey);
    if (decryptedData != null) {
      return decryptedData;
    }
  }
  return null; // Decryption failed
}

function getKeyHistory(shardId) {
  // Query KMS for the last N encryption keys used for the given shardId
  // N is a configurable parameter (e.g., 3)
  return KMS.getEncryptionKeys(shardId, N);
}
```

**5. Scalability & Performance Considerations:**

*   **Distributed KMS:** The KMS must be highly scalable and available.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Utilize hardware acceleration for encryption/decryption operations (e.g., AES-NI).
*   **Caching:** Cache frequently accessed encryption keys in memory.
*   **Asynchronous Key Rotation:** Rotate keys asynchronously to minimize performance impact.
