## Dynamic Scene Generation via Generative AI & User Biofeedback

**Concept:** Expand beyond pre-defined scenes to dynamically generate audiovisual content segments *during* recording, guided by generative AI responding to user biofeedback and environmental analysis.

**Specs:**

*   **Biofeedback Sensor Integration:** Integrate wearable sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial muscle activity) with the mobile device. Data transmitted in real-time.
*   **Environmental Analysis Module:** Utilize device cameras & microphones for real-time analysis of surrounding environment (lighting, sound levels, detected objects/people).
*   **Generative AI Core:** A locally-run (or cloud-connected) generative AI model (text-to-video/image, audio generation). Pre-trained on a vast dataset of product reviews/demonstrations.  Model is fine-tuned to the specific product being reviewed.
*   **Dynamic Scene Scripting:**  AI core analyzes biofeedback & environment to dynamically construct a ‘scene script’. Script dictates:
    *   **Visual Style:**  (e.g., "fast-paced, energetic demo", "calm, informative close-up", "lifestyle shot - warm lighting")
    *   **Audio Cues:** (music genre, sound effects, voiceover prompts – delivered via device speakers or headphones).
    *   **Camera Guidance:** (on-screen overlays indicating desired camera angles, zoom levels, and movement, if device supports motorized camera controls).
*   **Real-Time Content Generation:** Based on the script, AI generates short (5-15 second) audiovisual segments *during* recording.  These segments are seamlessly stitched together to form the final review.
*   **User Override:** Users can actively override AI suggestions or generated content at any time. (e.g. voice command “try a different angle”, swipe gestures to reject a generated segment).
*   **Data Store Integration:** The system stores:
    *   Raw biofeedback data
    *   Environmental analysis data
    *   AI-generated scripts
    *   Final review content
    *   User override data. This data is used to continuously refine the AI model’s performance.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Load AI Model (product-specific fine-tuning)
Connect Biofeedback Sensors
Initialize Environmental Analysis Module

// Main Loop (during recording)
While (Recording Active) {
    BiofeedbackData = GetBiofeedbackData()
    EnvironmentalData = GetEnvironmentalData()

    SceneScript = GenerateSceneScript(BiofeedbackData, EnvironmentalData, CurrentProduct)

    GeneratedSegment = GenerateAVSegment(SceneScript)

    DisplaySegmentToUser() //On-screen preview

    If (UserOverrideReceived()) {
        HandleOverride()
    } Else {
        AppendSegmentToReview()
    }
}

//Data Storage
Store all data points.
```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   **Mood Detection:** Analyze user facial expressions to infer emotional state and adapt the generated content accordingly.
*   **AR Integration:** Overlay AI-generated visuals or information onto the real-world view through the device's camera.
*   **Gamification:** Introduce challenges or rewards to encourage users to experiment with different recording styles and AI suggestions.
*   **Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to collaboratively create a review, with the AI adapting to the combined biofeedback and environmental data.
