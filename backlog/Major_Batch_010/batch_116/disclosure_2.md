## Dynamic Void Mapping & Adaptive Dunnage Deployment

**Concept:** Integrate real-time volumetric scanning *within* the sealed container during the dunnage injection process to create a precise 3D map of voids. This data then drives an adaptive dunnage deployment strategy, altering gas pressure and dunnage volume *per void* for optimal protection.

**Specifications:**

**1. Integrated Scanning Module:**

*   **Sensor Type:** Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera or structured light scanner, miniaturized and designed for operation within a sealed container environment. Must be resistant to potential dunnage materials and gas exposure.
*   **Mounting:** Integrated into the injector head.  Camera/scanner field of view encompasses a cone extending outward from the injector tip.
*   **Resolution:** Minimum 5cm resolution to identify relevant void spaces.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Continuous scanning during initial injector penetration and gas/dunnage expulsion.

**2. Real-Time Void Mapping Software:**

*   **Data Processing:** Software receives raw scan data and constructs a 3D point cloud representation of the containerâ€™s interior.
*   **Void Identification:** Algorithm identifies contiguous empty spaces (voids) within the point cloud. Parameters include minimum void volume, maximum void surface area, and filtering to exclude minor imperfections.
*   **Void Characterization:** For each identified void:
    *   **Volume Calculation:** Accurate volumetric measurement of the void.
    *   **Shape Analysis:** Determination of void shape (spherical, cylindrical, irregular).
    *   **Proximity Analysis:** Assessment of void proximity to the item being protected and to other voids.
*   **Data Output:**  A dynamic 3D map of voids with associated volumetric and geometric data, updated continuously during the dunnage injection process.

**3. Adaptive Dnnage Deployment System:**

*   **Gas Pressure Control:** Precise control over gas pressure delivered through the injector.  Able to independently adjust pressure to multiple injectors simultaneously.
*   **Dunnage Volume Control:** Metered dunnage delivery system, capable of varying the amount of dunnage expelled per injector.
*   **Deployment Algorithm:**
    *   **Void Prioritization:** Based on void volume, shape, and proximity to the item, voids are prioritized for dunnage filling.
    *   **Pressure Adjustment:**  Larger, more irregular voids receive higher gas pressure to ensure complete dunnage expansion. Smaller voids receive lower pressure.
    *   **Volume Adjustment:** The algorithm calculates the appropriate dunnage volume for each void based on its size and shape.
    *   **Sequential Filling:** The system sequentially fills prioritized voids, adjusting gas pressure and dunnage volume as needed.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Pressure sensors within the container monitor gas pressure. If the target pressure is not achieved, the algorithm adjusts gas delivery accordingly.

**4. System Integration:**

*   The scanning module, void mapping software, and adaptive dunnage deployment system are integrated into the existing computing system (as described in the patent).
*   A user interface displays the real-time void map and allows for manual override of deployment parameters.



**Pseudocode (Deployment Algorithm):**

```
Initialize:
  VoidMap = Empty
  PriorityQueue = Empty

During Injection:
  Acquire Scan Data
  Update VoidMap
  For each Void in VoidMap:
    Calculate Priority Score (Volume, Shape, Proximity)
    Add Void to PriorityQueue

While PriorityQueue is not Empty:
  Void = Pop Highest Priority Void from PriorityQueue
  Calculate Target Gas Pressure for Void
  Calculate Target Dnnage Volume for Void
  Set Gas Pressure to Target Gas Pressure
  Expel Target Dnnage Volume through Injector
  Monitor Container Pressure
  Adjust Gas Pressure if needed
  Repeat until target container pressure is reached
