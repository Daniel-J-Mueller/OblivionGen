## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predictive Throttling

**Concept:** Expand the adaptive throttling concept beyond simply *reacting* to activity data. Implement a predictive throttling system that anticipates processing needs and proactively adjusts resource allocation *before* bottlenecks occur. This builds on the existing system by adding a predictive layer.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Engine Core:**

*   **Model Type:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) variant preferred. LSTM is ideal for time-series data and capturing dependencies over time.
*   **Input Data:**
    *   Historical activity data from the hardware-based activity monitor (as in the base patent).
    *   Data from the software-based activity monitor (temperature, voltage, etc.).
    *   Metadata about the currently executing machine learning task (model type, layer complexity, input data size).
    *   External signals: Power consumption metrics.
*   **Output Data:** A predicted “resource demand score” for the next ‘N’ processing cycles (N configurable – default 10-20 cycles).  Score reflects expected systolic array utilization.
*   **Training:**  Continuous online learning. Model retrained with each completed task. Data augmented with simulated workloads to improve robustness.
*   **Implementation:** Dedicated, low-latency processing unit on the integrated circuit.  May share resources with the existing software-based activity monitor, but requires prioritization.

**2. Dynamic Resource Allocator:**

*   **Resource Types:**
    *   Systolic Array Clock Speed.
    *   Voltage Levels to individual systolic array processing elements.
    *   Data Prefetch Buffer Size.
    *   Allocation of systolic array processing elements.
*   **Allocation Algorithm:**
    *   Based on the predicted resource demand score from the Predictive Engine Core.
    *   Utilizes a cost function that balances performance (throughput) with energy consumption.
    *   Prioritizes critical tasks based on metadata.
*   **Implementation:**  Integrated within the hardware-based activity monitor.

**3. Action Table Enhancement:**

*   Expand the existing action table to include pre-defined resource allocation profiles corresponding to different resource demand score ranges.
*   Allow for fine-grained adjustment of voltage levels to individual processing elements to optimize power consumption.
*   Include a mechanism for ‘learning’ optimal resource allocation profiles over time.

**4. Pseudocode:**

```
// Inside Software-Based Activity Monitor

function predict_resource_demand(historical_data, task_metadata):
    // Feed data into the LSTM model
    resource_demand_score = LSTM_Model.predict(historical_data, task_metadata)
    return resource_demand_score

function allocate_resources(resource_demand_score):
    // Lookup the corresponding resource allocation profile
    resource_profile = ActionTable.lookup(resource_demand_score)

    // Adjust systolic array clock speed, voltage levels, and prefetch buffer size
    HardwareActivityMonitor.set_clock_speed(resource_profile.clock_speed)
    HardwareActivityMonitor.set_voltage_levels(resource_profile.voltage_levels)
    HardwareActivityMonitor.set_prefetch_buffer_size(resource_profile.prefetch_buffer_size)

// Main Loop
while (true):
    historical_data = collect_historical_data()
    task_metadata = get_task_metadata()
    resource_demand_score = predict_resource_demand(historical_data, task_metadata)
    allocate_resources(resource_demand_score)
```

**5.  Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Resource Allocation:**  Shifts from reactive to proactive resource management.
*   **LSTM-Based Prediction:** Leverages the power of LSTMs to accurately predict future resource demands.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** Enables fine-grained control over systolic array resources.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  Continuously learns and optimizes resource allocation profiles.
