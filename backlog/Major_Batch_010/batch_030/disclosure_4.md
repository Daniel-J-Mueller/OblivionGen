## Dynamic Sensory Substitution for Item Detail

**Concept:** Expand beyond visual/auditory presentation by incorporating haptic and olfactory feedback tied to item attributes, creating a multi-sensory experience. The system dynamically selects and delivers appropriate sensory stimuli based on detected item characteristics and user preferences.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Engine:** Array of micro-actuators capable of simulating textures, shapes, and weights.  Integration with a wearable device (glove, wristband) or localized surface.
*   **Olfactory Engine:** Cartridge-based scent delivery system with a library of relevant aromas. Precise control over scent intensity and duration.
*   **Item Attribute Mapping:** Database linking item attributes (material, weight, color, flavor, scent) to specific haptic and olfactory profiles.  Machine learning component for refining these mappings based on user feedback.
*   **User Preference Profile:** Storage of user preferences regarding sensory intensity, favored/disliked scents/textures, and accessibility settings (e.g., disabling haptics for users with sensitivity).
*   **Synchronous Presentation Controller:** Core component responsible for orchestrating the visual, auditory, haptic, and olfactory outputs. Uses the item attribute mapping, user preferences, and synchronous presentation timing derived from the existing audio file markup.

**Workflow:**

1.  The system receives item search results and associated supporting data (as in the patent).
2.  The Synchronous Presentation Controller analyzes the current item and identifies relevant attributes.
3.  Based on attribute mapping and user preferences, the controller generates a sensory profile.
4.  The profile is transmitted to the Haptic Engine and Olfactory Engine.
5.  The engines deliver the corresponding stimuli *in sync* with the visual and auditory presentation.

**Pseudocode (Sensory Profile Generation):**

```
function generate_sensory_profile(item_data, user_preferences) {
  profile = {}

  // Get relevant attributes
  material = item_data.material
  weight = item_data.weight
  color = item_data.color
  scent = item_data.scent

  // Haptic Profile
  if (material == "wood") {
    profile.haptic = "rough texture, warm temperature"
  } else if (material == "metal") {
    profile.haptic = "smooth texture, cool temperature"
  }

  //Olfactory Profile
  if(scent == "vanilla"){
    profile.olfactory = "vanilla scent, 30% intensity"
  }
  if(scent == "leather"){
    profile.olfactory = "leather scent, 20% intensity"
  }

  //Apply User Preferences
  if(user_preferences.haptic_intensity == "low"){
    profile.haptic_intensity = "low"
  }

  return profile
}
```

**Example Scenario:**

User searches for "leather jacket." System presents visual and auditory information. Simultaneously, the haptic engine simulates the feel of leather on the user's hand (via a glove), and the olfactory engine releases a subtle leather scent.  As the user focuses on a particular detail (e.g., stitching), the haptic engine can increase the texture simulation in that area.
