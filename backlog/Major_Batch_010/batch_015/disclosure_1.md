## Dynamic Content-Aware Grid Refinement

**Concept:** Extend the existing grid-based navigation by dynamically refining the grid resolution based on content density and user interaction patterns. Instead of a static grid, the system analyzes webpage elements in real-time and adjusts cell size and shape to create a more intuitive and efficient navigation experience.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Content Density Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: DOM structure of the webpage.
    *   Process:
        *   Calculate the "visual weight" of each element based on size, contrast, and position.
        *   Identify "dense regions" – areas with high concentrations of visually weighted elements.
        *   Determine optimal grid cell size for each region – smaller cells in dense regions, larger cells in sparse regions.
    *   Output: A content density map indicating optimal grid cell size for each area of the webpage.

2.  **Adaptive Grid Generation Module:**
    *   Input: Content density map, webpage dimensions.
    *   Process:
        *   Generate a non-uniform grid – cells are dynamically sized and shaped based on the content density map.  Cells can be rectangular, square, or even irregularly shaped (e.g., polygons) to better conform to content boundaries.
        *   Implement a “snap-to-content” feature – automatically align grid cell boundaries with visually prominent elements (e.g., images, headings, buttons).
    *   Output: Dynamic, non-uniform grid overlaid on the webpage.

3.  **User Interaction Learning Module:**
    *   Input: User navigation history (arrow key presses, hotkey usage), dwell time on elements, scrolling behavior.
    *   Process:
        *   Track frequently accessed elements and navigation paths.
        *   Identify "hotspots" – areas where the user spends most of their time.
        *   Adjust grid resolution and cell placement based on user behavior – refine the grid to prioritize frequently accessed content.
        *   Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to continuously optimize the grid based on user feedback.
    *   Output: Adjusted grid configuration.

4.  **Navigation Engine Integration:**
    *   Integrate the dynamic grid with the existing arrow key and hotkey navigation functionality.
    *   Implement a "smart navigation" algorithm – when the user presses an arrow key, the system intelligently selects the target element based on both grid position and element importance (e.g., prioritize interactive elements over static text).

**Pseudocode (Smart Navigation Algorithm):**

```
function navigate(direction, currentElement):
  candidates = getGridCandidates(currentElement, direction)
  
  if candidates is empty:
    return currentElement

  scoredCandidates = []
  for candidate in candidates:
    score = calculateScore(candidate)
    scoredCandidates.append((candidate, score))

  scoredCandidates.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

  targetElement = scoredCandidates[0][0]
  return targetElement

function calculateScore(element):
  score = 0
  if element.isInteractive():
    score += 50
  if element.isHighlighted():
    score += 30
  score += element.visualWeight // from content density analysis
  return score
```

**Hardware Requirements:** Standard web browser with sufficient processing power to run the analysis modules. No specialized hardware is required.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved navigation efficiency for complex webpages.
*   More intuitive user experience.
*   Increased accessibility for users with disabilities.
*   Potential for personalized navigation experiences.
