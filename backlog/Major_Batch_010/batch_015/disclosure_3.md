## Dynamic Contextual Suppression & Amplification

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** "Contextual Resonance Engine" (CRE) – Software module operating on user data streams.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time user activity: browsing history, search queries, social media interactions (with user consent/privacy controls).
    *   Item metadata: categories, tags, sentiment analysis of reviews, visual features.
    *   Temporal data: time of day, day of week, seasonal trends, current events.
    *   Geographic data: user location (coarse-grained, with consent).
*   **Data Storage:** Distributed graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) – representing users, items, and their relationships.
*   **Processing Units:** Multiple AI models (described below).
*   **Output:** Suppression/Amplification scores for item categories, influencing content presentation.

**AI Models:**

1.  **"Resonance Detector"**:  A multi-modal AI (combining NLP, computer vision, and temporal analysis) that identifies ‘resonant’ themes in a user's current context.  Resonance isn’t just about explicit interests, but also *implicit* moods, anxieties, and aspirations gleaned from their data.  (e.g., User searches for "hiking boots" + posts about feeling stressed -> Resonance = "Escape", "Outdoor Wellbeing"). Output is a weighted vector of resonant themes.
2.  **"Category Sentiment Analyzer"**:  Analyzes item categories (e.g., "Political News", "Fast Fashion") based on a continuous stream of real-time data.  Determines a ‘sentiment score’ for each category, reflecting its current cultural relevance and user perception (positive, negative, neutral). This is *not* static; it adapts based on current events and social discourse.
3.  **"Interaction Predictor"**: Trained on historical data, predicts the likelihood of a user interacting with items from a given category *given their current resonant themes and the category's sentiment*. Outputs a probability score.
4.  **"Suppression/Amplification Engine"**: Combines the outputs of the above models to calculate a dynamic suppression or amplification score for each category.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//For each user, per presentation cycle:

1.  resonateThemes = ResonanceDetector(userDataStream)
2.  categorySentiment = CategorySentimentAnalyzer(realtimeData)
3.  interactionLikelihood = InteractionPredictor(resonateThemes, categorySentiment)
4.  suppressionAmplificationScore =  (interactionLikelihood * categorySentimentWeight) + (1 - interactionLikelihood) * suppressionWeight
5.  //Apply suppressionAmplificationScore to content filtering
    // If score < threshold: Suppress category
    // If score > threshold: Amplify category
```

**System Behavior:**

*   **Beyond Suppression:** This isn’t just about hiding content. Amplification boosts the visibility of content resonating with the user's *current* state, potentially introducing them to new interests.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** The system continuously learns and adjusts its behavior based on user feedback and changing contextual factors.
*   **Granularity:** Suppression/Amplification operates at the *category* level, providing a more nuanced approach than simple item-level filtering.
*   **Transparency (Optional):**  Users could be provided with a (simplified) explanation of why certain content is being presented or suppressed (e.g., "We're showing you more outdoor content because you've expressed interest in escaping stress.").

**Novelty:**

The existing patent focuses on suppression based on historical interaction *times*. This system moves beyond time-based filters to incorporate *real-time context* and *sentiment analysis*, creating a dynamic and adaptive content presentation engine. The amplification component, coupled with the granular category-level control, is a significant departure from the purely suppressive approach. The goal is to curate an experience attuned to the user’s *present* state, rather than their past behavior.
