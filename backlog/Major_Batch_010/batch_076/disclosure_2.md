## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Projection

**Concept:** Augment the existing projection system with localized haptic feedback, creating the sensation of texture or resistance directly on the user’s hand or fingers as they interact with the projected interface. This extends the interaction beyond visual, and into tactile.

**Specs:**

*   **Projection System:** Utilize the existing projector(s) as described in the patent.
*   **Ultrasonic Transducer Array:** Integrate an array of focused ultrasonic transducers surrounding the projection area.  Transducer density: 500 per square meter. Adjustable frequency range: 20 kHz – 80 kHz.
*   **Depth Sensor Array:** Complement the existing cameras with a high-resolution depth sensor array (time-of-flight or structured light) to track hand/finger position in 3D space with sub-millimeter accuracy. Refresh Rate: 240Hz.
*   **Software Module – Haptic Mapping:**
    *   Input:  Image data from cameras, depth data from depth sensors, and interface element data (e.g., button, slider, texture) from application.
    *   Processing: Algorithm maps interface elements to localized haptic effects.  Higher intensity elements equate to higher ultrasonic energy concentration.  Texture mapping employs ultrasonic modulation to simulate surface variations.
    *   Output: Control signals for ultrasonic transducer array.  Independent control of each transducer.
*   **Software Module – Safety & Calibration:**
    *   Real-time monitoring of ultrasonic energy levels. Automatic power reduction if hand proximity exceeds safety thresholds.
    *   Calibration routine to compensate for individual hand/finger characteristics and environmental factors (temperature, humidity).
    *   User-adjustable intensity settings.
*   **Hardware Integration:**
    *   Transducer array housed within a protective frame surrounding the projection area.
    *   System powered by a dedicated power supply.
    *   Communication between cameras, depth sensors, processing unit, and transducer array via high-speed data link.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Mapping Module):**

```
function generateHapticFeedback(image_data, depth_data, interface_elements):
  hand_location = detectHand(image_data, depth_data)
  if hand_location == null:
    return null

  haptic_effects = []
  for element in interface_elements:
    element_location = calculateElementLocation(element, image_data)
    distance = calculateDistance(hand_location, element_location)

    if distance < interaction_threshold:
      effect_intensity = calculateIntensity(element.type, element.size, distance)
      effect_shape = determineShape(element.type)
      haptic_effects.append({
          "location": element_location,
          "intensity": effect_intensity,
          "shape": effect_shape
      })

  return haptic_effects

function determineShape(element_type):
  if element_type == "button":
    return "focused_pulse"
  elif element_type == "slider":
    return "linear_gradient"
  elif element_type == "texture":
    return "modulated_noise"
  else:
    return "default_pulse"
```

**Innovation:**  Combines projected visuals with localized haptic feedback, creating a more immersive and intuitive interaction experience.  The dynamic modulation of ultrasonic energy allows for the simulation of various textures, shapes, and forces, enhancing usability and accessibility.  The safety features ensure responsible operation.
