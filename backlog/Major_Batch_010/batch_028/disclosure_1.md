## Decentralized Reputation Scoring for Compromised Credentials

**Concept:** Extend the compromised authentication information clearinghouse concept into a decentralized, reputation-based system leveraging a permissioned blockchain. Instead of a central authority maintaining tags and sharing information, participating identity providers (IdPs) contribute and validate compromise data, building a reputation score for credentials.

**Specifications:**

*   **Blockchain:** A permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda) will form the foundation. Participating IdPs will be nodes on the network.
*   **Credential Hash Storage:** The blockchain will *not* store credentials directly. It will store cryptographic hashes of credentials (e.g., salted SHA-256) that have been flagged as compromised.
*   **Compromise Reporting:** IdPs detecting compromised credentials (through breach monitoring, password spraying attempts, etc.) submit a transaction to the blockchain including the credential hash and associated metadata (breach source, confidence level, timestamp).
*   **Reputation Scoring:**  Each credential hash will have a dynamically updated reputation score.  This score is calculated based on:
    *   **Number of Reporting IdPs:** More reports increase the score.
    *   **Reporting IdP Reputation:**  IdPs themselves have a reputation score based on the accuracy of their past reports (validated through independent verification).  Reports from higher-reputation IdPs have more weight.
    *   **Time Decay:**  Older reports have reduced weight, assuming compromises may be remediated.
*   **Access Control:** When a service requests authentication, it queries the blockchain for the reputation score of the presented credentials.  The service can then define thresholds for acceptance (e.g., "reject credentials with a reputation score above 0.7").
*   **Data Validation & Dispute Resolution:** A consensus mechanism is used to validate reported compromises.  Disputes are resolved through a pre-defined governance process involving multiple IdPs acting as arbiters.
*   **API Integration:** Standardized APIs allow services and IdPs to integrate with the blockchain network.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** Utilize zero-knowledge proofs or other privacy-enhancing technologies to minimize the exposure of sensitive data.  Only the credential hash and reputation score are publicly visible on the blockchain.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Reputation Score Calculation):**

```
function calculate_reputation_score(credential_hash):
  reports = get_reports_for_credential(credential_hash)
  total_weight = 0
  weighted_sum = 0

  for report in reports:
    idp_reputation = get_idp_reputation(report.idp_id)
    time_decay_factor = calculate_time_decay(report.timestamp)
    weight = idp_reputation * time_decay_factor
    weighted_sum += weight
    total_weight += weight

  if total_weight > 0:
    reputation_score = weighted_sum / total_weight
  else:
    reputation_score = 0  // Or some default value

  return reputation_score
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   Smart contracts will handle the logic for reporting compromises, calculating reputation scores, and managing access control.
*   Off-chain storage may be used for large datasets of compromise data to improve performance.
*   Regular audits of the blockchain network and smart contracts are essential to ensure security and integrity.
