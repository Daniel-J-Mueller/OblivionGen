**Dynamic Message Queue Sharding via Predictive Load Balancing**

**Concept:** Extend the existing data stream generation to incorporate predictive load balancing across dynamically sharded message queues. The system currently detects and alerts on unauthorized access. This builds on that by *proactively* preventing overload by intelligently distributing incoming requests *before* they hit a single queue, anticipating load spikes.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Predictive Model Integration:**
    *   A time-series forecasting module (e.g., utilizing LSTM or Prophet models) integrated into the data stream processing pipeline.
    *   Input Data: Historical message request rates (derived from the existing data stream), time-of-day, day-of-week, external event data (e.g., marketing campaign schedules, public holidays).
    *   Output: Predicted message request rate for each message queue shard (initially based on existing queue structure).
2.  **Dynamic Sharding Engine:**
    *   Responds to predictions from the predictive model.
    *   Manages a pool of available message queue shards (can leverage containerization technologies like Docker/Kubernetes for scalability).
    *   Algorithm:
        *   If predicted load on a shard exceeds a threshold:
            *   Spin up a new shard.
            *   Adjust routing rules to distribute incoming requests across available shards based on predicted load.
        *   If a shard is consistently underutilized:
            *   Shut down the shard.
            *   Redistribute its load to other shards.
3.  **Intelligent Routing Rules:**
    *   Routing is *not* solely based on hash or round-robin.
    *   Routing considers:
        *   Shard capacity (CPU, memory, network).
        *   Predicted load.
        *   Message attributes (e.g., priority, message type) - enabling prioritization for critical messages.
4.  **Data Stream Augmentation:**
    *   The existing data stream is augmented with:
        *   Shard ID to which each message request was routed.
        *   Predicted load on the target shard at the time of routing.
        *   Actual load on the target shard after processing the request.
        *   Routing decision rationale (e.g., "Shard 3 selected due to lowest predicted load").
5.  **Feedback Loop:**
    *   The augmented data stream is fed back into the predictive model to continuously refine its accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Routing Logic):**

```
function routeMessage(message, availableShards):
  // Get predicted load for each shard
  predictedLoads = getPredictedLoads(availableShards)

  // Calculate a 'score' for each shard based on predicted load and capacity
  for each shard in availableShards:
    score = shard.capacity / predictedLoads[shard.id]

  // Select the shard with the highest score
  selectedShard = max(availableShards, key=lambda shard: shard.capacity / predictedLoads[shard.id])

  // Route the message to the selected shard
  routeMessageToShard(message, selectedShard)

  // Log routing decision
  logRoutingDecision(message, selectedShard, predictedLoads)

  return selectedShard
```
