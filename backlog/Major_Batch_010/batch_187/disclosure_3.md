**Adaptive Projection Mapping for Dynamic Environments**

**Concept:** Expand the self-imaging alignment indicator to function as a dynamic projection mapping system that adapts to changing environmental conditions and user movements *in real-time*. The current patent uses fixed lens/pattern combinations to indicate alignment. This design replaces those fixed elements with computational control over both the projected pattern *and* the lens array itself, creating a truly interactive and adaptable guidance system.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Core System:**
    *   Camera: High-resolution RGB-D camera (e.g., Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect) for capturing environment geometry and user position.
    *   Processing Unit: Embedded system (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson series) for real-time data processing, pattern generation, and lens control.
    *   Projection Unit: Micro-LED or DLP projector with high brightness and contrast.
    *   Lens Array:  Array of individually addressable liquid crystal lenses (LCLs). Each lens can dynamically adjust its focal length and beam steering.  Resolution: 100x100 minimum.
    *   Pattern Generation: Software module capable of generating 2D/3D graphical patterns in real-time.

2.  **Software Architecture:**
    *   Environment Mapping:  RGB-D data used to construct a 3D mesh of the surrounding environment.
    *   User Tracking:  Skeleton tracking algorithms to determine user position, orientation, and movement.
    *   Pattern Design Module: Allows creation of custom graphical patterns, including directional indicators, progress bars, or interactive elements. Patterns are defined as parametric functions.
    *   Projection Mapping Engine:  The core component that calculates the optimal projection parameters for each lens in the array, based on user position, environment geometry, and desired pattern.  This uses ray tracing to determine where to direct light to create the desired projection on the environment.
    *   Lens Control Interface:  Software interface for controlling the focal length and beam steering of each LCL.  Requires precise calibration of the lens array.

3.  **Operational Modes:**
    *   Alignment Guidance:  The system projects a dynamic alignment indicator that adjusts its position and orientation in real-time, guiding the user to the optimal position in front of the camera.  This is the primary use case, building on the original patent's functionality.
    *   Interactive Projection:  The system projects interactive elements onto the environment, allowing the user to interact with the projected content using gestures or body movements.  For example, projecting a virtual keyboard onto a surface.
    *   Dynamic Masking:  The system uses the environment map to dynamically mask the projected content, preventing it from being projected onto unwanted surfaces.
    *   Augmented Reality Overlay: The system projects information onto the environment as an AR overlay.

4.  **Pseudocode - Projection Mapping Engine:**

```
function calculate_projection_parameters(user_position, environment_map, pattern):
  for each lens in lens_array:
    for each point in pattern:
      # Raytrace from lens to desired point on environment
      ray = create_ray(lens, point)
      intersection = raytrace(ray, environment_map)
      if intersection:
        # Calculate lens parameters to hit intersection point
        focal_length, steering_angle = calculate_lens_parameters(lens, intersection)
        set_lens_parameters(lens, focal_length, steering_angle)
      else:
        # Point is occluded or outside projection area
        continue
```

5.  **Materials:**
    *   Lens Array Substrate: Transparent acrylic or polycarbonate.
    *   LCL Material: High-birefringence liquid crystal material.
    *   Enclosure: Lightweight and durable plastic or aluminum.

6.  **Power:**
    *   Input Voltage: 12V DC
    *   Power Consumption: 50W maximum

This design moves beyond static alignment indicators to a fully interactive and dynamic projection system. It requires significant engineering effort, particularly in lens control and real-time data processing, but unlocks a wide range of new applications beyond the scope of the original patent.
