**Dynamic Wishlist Prioritization via Predictive Analytics**

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive Wishlist Engine (PWE)
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   User Purchase History (all platforms, if permission granted)
    *   Wishlist Item Attributes (category, price, features, etc.)
    *   Real-time Inventory Data (across partnered e-commerce sites)
    *   Social Media Trend Analysis (relevant keywords, hashtags)
    *   External Event Data (holidays, local events, weather)
    *   Browsing History (with user consent)
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   Collaborative Filtering (identifies similar user preferences)
    *   Content-Based Filtering (matches item attributes to user profile)
    *   Time Series Analysis (predicts future demand based on historical data)
    *   Sentiment Analysis (gauges user interest from social media)
    *   Regression Models (predicts purchase probability)
*   **Output:**
    *   Dynamic Wishlist Ranking (items prioritized based on predicted purchase likelihood)
    *   Automated Price Drop Alerts (for high-priority items)
    *   Personalized Product Recommendations (within the wishlist context)
    *   Proactive "Low Stock" Notifications (encouraging timely purchase)

**Innovation Description:**

The PWE integrates data from diverse sources to predict which wishlist items a user is *most likely* to purchase. This goes beyond simple sorting by price or date added. Instead, the system proactively ranks the wishlist, highlighting items that are predicted to be of immediate interest.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateWishlistItemScore(user, item)
    score = 0

    // Collaborative Filtering
    similarUsers = FindSimilarUsers(user)
    FOR each user IN similarUsers
        IF user purchased item THEN
            score += 0.4  //Weight of 40% for collaborative filtering
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Content-Based Filtering
    userPreferences = GetUserPreferences(user)
    itemAttributes = GetItemAttributes(item)
    attributeMatchScore = CalculateAttributeMatch(userPreferences, itemAttributes)
    score += attributeMatchScore * 0.3 // Weight of 30% for content filtering

    // Time Series Analysis & Demand Prediction
    historicalSalesData = GetHistoricalSalesData(item)
    demandScore = PredictFutureDemand(historicalSalesData)
    score += demandScore * 0.1 // Weight of 10% for demand

    // External Event Influence (holidays, weather)
    eventScore = CalculateEventInfluence(item)
    score += eventScore * 0.1 // Weight of 10% for events

    // Low Stock Impact
    IF IsLowStock(item) THEN
      score += 0.1
    ENDIF

    RETURN score
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION UpdateWishlistRanking(user, wishlist)
  FOR each item IN wishlist
    score = CalculateWishlistItemScore(user, item)
    item.score = score
  ENDFOR

  SORT wishlist BY item.score DESC
  RETURN wishlist
END FUNCTION
```

**User Interface Integration:**

*   Wishlist items are displayed with a "Predicted Interest" score (visualized as a bar or star rating).
*   Items with high scores are prominently featured (e.g., moved to the top of the list, highlighted with a different color).
*   Users can optionally disable the "Predicted Interest" feature if they prefer a traditional wishlist experience.
*   Automated email/push notifications alert users to significant price drops or low stock levels for their top-ranked items.
