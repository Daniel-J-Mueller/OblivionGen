## Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation via Predictive User Profiling

**Specification:** A system for proactively adjusting bandwidth allocation based on predicted user behavior, extending beyond reactive throttling described in the provided patent.

**Core Concept:** Instead of *reacting* to peak bandwidth usage, the system *predicts* likely periods of high demand for individual users and preemptively allocates resources. This allows for smoother user experiences and potentially reduces overall network congestion.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Data Collection Module:**
    *   Continuously monitors user network activity.
    *   Logs data points including:
        *   Time of day.
        *   Day of week.
        *   Application usage (categorized â€“ e.g., video streaming, gaming, web browsing, data transfer).
        *   Data volume per application.
        *   User-defined "activity profiles" (e.g., "work hours," "gaming session," "family movie night").
2.  **Predictive Modeling Engine:**
    *   Employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., recurrent neural networks, time series analysis) to analyze collected behavioral data.
    *   Generates a probability distribution representing the likelihood of high bandwidth demand for each user at any given time.
    *   Considers historical data, current activity, and user-defined profiles.
    *   Updates the model continuously based on new data.
3.  **Bandwidth Allocation Manager:**
    *   Receives probability distributions from the Predictive Modeling Engine.
    *   Dynamically adjusts bandwidth allocation for each user based on predicted demand.
    *   Prioritizes users with higher predicted demand, potentially reserving bandwidth in advance.
    *   Employs a tiered allocation system:
        *   **Guaranteed Bandwidth:** A baseline allocation ensuring a minimum level of service.
        *   **Dynamic Bandwidth:** Bandwidth allocated based on predicted demand, up to a maximum limit.
        *   **Burst Bandwidth:** Temporary bandwidth allocation for short-term spikes in demand.
4.  **Resource Balancing Module:**
    *   Monitors overall network capacity and dynamically adjusts allocation parameters to prevent congestion.
    *   Employs a cost function that considers both user experience and network efficiency.
    *   Can implement global adjustments, such as reducing burst bandwidth limits during peak network hours.

**Pseudocode (Bandwidth Allocation Manager):**

```
FOR EACH user IN user_list:
    predicted_demand = PredictiveModelingEngine.get_predicted_demand(user)
    
    guaranteed_bandwidth = user.get_guaranteed_bandwidth()
    
    dynamic_bandwidth = predicted_demand * user.get_max_dynamic_bandwidth()
    
    total_bandwidth = guaranteed_bandwidth + dynamic_bandwidth
    
    IF total_bandwidth > user.get_max_bandwidth():
        total_bandwidth = user.get_max_bandwidth()
        dynamic_bandwidth = total_bandwidth - guaranteed_bandwidth
    
    NetworkManager.allocate_bandwidth(user, total_bandwidth)
    
    // Regularly update allocations (e.g., every 5 seconds)
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simply reacting to bandwidth spikes to actively *predicting* and *preparing* for them. By preemptively allocating resources, it aims to provide a more seamless user experience and improve overall network efficiency. The tiered allocation system and the integration of user-defined profiles add further layers of customization and control.
