## Dynamic Product ‘Ecosystem’ Visualization

**Concept:** Expand the idea of cross-site relationship discovery to create a visually interactive “product ecosystem” for the user. Instead of simply linking to a complementary or alternative product, present a dynamic graph showcasing related items *across multiple vendors*, including user-generated content and aggregate reviews.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Aggregation Layer:**

*   **Cross-Site Web Scraping/API Integration:** Develop a system that can reliably scrape product information (name, price, images, descriptions, reviews) from a wide range of e-commerce sites. Prioritize sites with open APIs for more robust data retrieval.  Focus on major retailers initially, then expand.
*   **Semantic Analysis:** Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand product descriptions and user reviews. Extract key features, benefits, and use cases.  This will be used for relationship mapping.
*   **User Behavior Data Integration:** Combine scraped data with user browsing/purchase history from *our* platform. This adds a personalized layer to the ecosystem.
*   **Data Normalization:** Standardize product data (e.g., units of measure, currency) to ensure compatibility across different sources.

**2. Relationship Mapping Algorithm:**

*   **Core Relationships:** Beyond complementary/alternative, introduce relationships like “often purchased together,” “frequently compared,” “commonly used with,” “problem/solution” (e.g., a product that solves a common issue with another).
*   **Weighted Scoring:** Assign weights to different relationship types based on data frequency (e.g., “often purchased together” with a high weight if it occurs frequently).  User behavior data will strongly influence weights.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The algorithm should continuously update weights and relationships based on real-time data.
*   **Negative Relationships:** Identify products that are *not* compatible or are known to cause issues when used together.

**3. Visualization Engine:**

*   **Interactive Graph:** Display relationships as nodes and edges in a zoomable, pannable graph.  Nodes represent products, edges represent relationships.
*   **Node Customization:** Allow users to customize node appearance (e.g., color-coding by category, vendor).
*   **Edge Filtering:** Enable users to filter edges based on relationship type, vendor, price range, etc.
*   **Node Expansion:** Clicking on a node expands it to show more detailed information (e.g., images, reviews, price comparison).
*   **User-Generated Content Integration:** Display user-submitted photos, videos, and reviews directly within the graph.
*   **“Ecosystem Health” Indicator:**  A visual indicator (e.g., a color-coded ring around a node) representing the overall user sentiment towards a product (based on reviews and ratings).
*   **3D Visualization Mode:** Optional 3D mode allowing users to explore the ecosystem from different perspectives.

**4. User Interface:**

*   **Contextual Activation:** The ecosystem visualization should be triggered contextually. For example, when a user views a product, a button or link could appear to “Explore Ecosystem.”
*   **Search & Filtering:** Robust search and filtering options to quickly find specific products or relationships.
*   **Personalization:**  The ecosystem should be personalized based on the user's browsing history, preferences, and purchase data.
*   **Integration with Existing Shopping Cart:** Allow users to add products from different vendors directly to a single shopping cart.

**Pseudocode Example (Relationship Scoring):**

```
function calculate_relationship_score(product1, product2, data):
  score = 0

  // Co-purchase frequency
  co_purchase_count = data.get_co_purchase_count(product1, product2)
  score += co_purchase_count * 0.4

  // Semantic similarity
  similarity_score = calculate_semantic_similarity(product1.description, product2.description)
  score += similarity_score * 0.3

  // User behavior (our platform)
  user_interaction_score = data.get_user_interaction_score(product1, product2)
  score += user_interaction_score * 0.3

  return score
```

**Engineer Notes:** This is a complex system requiring significant data infrastructure and algorithmic development. Focus on scalable data aggregation, robust NLP, and a user-friendly visualization engine. Consider using graph databases to efficiently store and query relationship data.
