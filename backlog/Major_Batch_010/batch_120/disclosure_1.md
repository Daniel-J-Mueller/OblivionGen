## Adaptive Memory Partitioning with Predictive Allocation

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting unified memory allocation not just based on current neural network inference circuit usage, but *predictively* based on anticipated future needs. This builds on the existing concept of allocating portions of unified memory to different circuits, but introduces a learning component to optimize resource distribution.

**Components:**

*   **Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU):** Embedded within the integrated circuit, the PMU continuously monitors the neural network inference circuit’s memory access patterns – read/write frequencies, data transfer sizes, and latency.
*   **Prediction Engine:** A dedicated hardware block or software module (running on the microprocessor circuit) that analyzes the PMU data. It employs machine learning (specifically, time-series forecasting models like LSTM or Transformers) to predict future memory needs of the neural network inference circuit *before* they occur. Crucially, this also predicts the needs of the input processing circuit.
*   **Dynamic Memory Controller (DMC):** A modified memory controller responsible for physically re-allocating memory banks based on signals from the Prediction Engine. It can preemptively move data to optimize access speeds and reduce contention.
*   **Unified Memory:** As defined in the source patent, accessible by all circuits. Organized into banks for granular allocation.

**Operation:**

1.  **Baseline Profiling:** During initial operation, the PMU collects baseline performance data of the neural network inference circuit and input processing circuit.
2.  **Model Training:** The Prediction Engine uses this data to train its forecasting model.
3.  **Predictive Allocation:** While the neural network inference circuit is running, the PMU continues to feed performance data to the Prediction Engine. The Prediction Engine forecasts future memory needs (size, timing, access patterns) for both the inference and input circuits.
4.  **Preemptive Adjustment:** The Prediction Engine sends adjustment signals to the Dynamic Memory Controller. The DMC preemptively re-allocates memory banks, shifting data and adjusting access permissions to optimize resource utilization based on the predicted needs.
5.  **Continuous Learning:** The system continuously monitors actual memory usage versus predicted usage. Discrepancies are fed back into the Prediction Engine to refine its forecasting model.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine - Simplified):**

```
// Inputs: PMU Data (memory access patterns, timing)
// Outputs: Adjustment Signals (memory bank allocations)

function predict_memory_needs(PMU_Data) {
  // Load trained forecasting model
  model = load_model()

  // Predict future memory usage for inference circuit
  inference_prediction = model.predict(PMU_Data.inference_data)

  // Predict future memory usage for input processing circuit
  input_prediction = model.predict(PMU_Data.input_data)

  // Calculate total predicted memory needs
  total_needs = inference_prediction + input_prediction

  // Determine optimal memory bank allocation
  allocation_plan = calculate_allocation(total_needs)

  return allocation_plan
}

function calculate_allocation(total_needs) {
  // Logic to determine which memory banks to allocate to each circuit
  // Based on total needs and current allocation
  // Considerations: latency, bandwidth, contention

  // Example: allocate x banks to inference, y banks to input, z banks remain unallocated
  allocation = {
    inference: x,
    input: y,
    unallocated: z
  }
  return allocation
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved overall system performance and reduced latency.
*   Better resource utilization and reduced memory contention.
*   Adaptability to varying workloads and input data characteristics.
*   Enhanced energy efficiency.
