**Dynamic Access Inheritance & 'Ghost' Sessions**

**Concept:** Extend targeted access denial by allowing *temporary* access inheritance based on session activity, and create ‘ghost’ sessions for ongoing data protection even after a user explicitly logs out.

**Specification:**

**1. Session Profiling & Activity Vectors:**

*   **Data Collection:** Each user session is monitored for a dynamically generated activity vector. This vector encompasses:
    *   Document access patterns (frequency, duration, types)
    *   Collaboration activity (comments, edits, shares)
    *   Network location (IP address ranges, identified networks)
    *   Device characteristics (OS, browser, hardware identifiers)
*   **Vector Weighting:**  Each element of the activity vector is assigned a weight based on its perceived risk/sensitivity.  Higher weights for accessing highly confidential documents or performing sensitive actions.
*   **Baseline Establishment:** A baseline activity vector is created for each user based on historical session data. Deviations from this baseline trigger increased scrutiny or temporary restrictions.

**2.  Dynamic Access Inheritance:**

*   **Trusted Session Chains:**  If a user session exhibits activity strongly correlated with a ‘trusted’ session (e.g., session from a known secure network, session originating from a verified device), access permissions are *temporarily* inherited. This allows access to documents the user wouldn't normally have, based on contextual trust. Inheritance is time-limited and decays rapidly if activity deviates.
*   **Inheritance Levels:** Multiple levels of inheritance are defined, each granting increasing levels of access.  Higher levels require stronger correlation with the trusted session.
*   **Adaptive Trust Score:** Each session is assigned an adaptive trust score based on its activity vector and correlation with trusted sessions. This score influences the level of inherited access granted.

**3. 'Ghost' Sessions & Persistent Data Protection**

*   **Session Snapshot:** Upon user logout (or inactivity timeout), a 'ghost' session is created. This is a lightweight snapshot of the user's session state, including:
    *   Active document access (list of open/recently accessed documents)
    *   Recent collaboration activity
    *   Network/device context
*   **Persistent Access Restrictions:** Even after logout, the 'ghost' session is used to enforce ongoing access restrictions. If a user attempts to access a document that was actively being used in a previous session, access is automatically denied (or requires additional authentication).
*   **Data Leakage Prevention:**  'Ghost' sessions also monitor for unusual data transfer activity. If a user attempts to copy or download data from documents accessed in a previous session, the action is flagged for review.
*   **Timed Decay:** 'Ghost' sessions have a configurable lifetime. After the lifetime expires, the session data is purged.

**Pseudocode (Ghost Session Enforcement):**

```
function enforceGhostSession(user, document):
  ghostSessions = getGhostSessions(user)
  for session in ghostSessions:
    if document in session.activeDocuments:
      logAccessAttempt(user, document)
      denyAccess(user, document)
      return

  allowAccess(user, document)
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Requires a robust session management system.
*   Scalability is critical – ghost session data should be stored efficiently.
*   User privacy considerations – transparently inform users about ghost session functionality.
*   Integration with existing access control mechanisms is essential.
*   Potential for false positives – careful tuning of activity vector weighting and thresholds is required.
