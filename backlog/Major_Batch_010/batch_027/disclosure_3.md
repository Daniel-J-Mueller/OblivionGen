## Dynamic Certificate Sharding & Geo-DNS Integration

**Concept:** Extend automated certificate management to dynamically shard certificates based on geographic user location, integrating with GeoDNS to deliver optimized TLS handshakes and minimize latency.

**Specification:**

**1. Components:**

*   **Geo-Location Service:** A service capable of accurately determining user geographic location (IP-based, browser hints, etc.).
*   **Certificate Shard Manager:**  A module within the existing Certificate Manager responsible for:
    *   Generating multiple certificate shards (essentially, multiple certificates covering the same domain) optimized for different geographic regions.
    *   Maintaining a mapping between geographic regions and certificate shards.
    *   Tracking certificate shard health and expiration.
*   **GeoDNS Integration Module:** A component interfacing with the GeoDNS provider. This module updates GeoDNS records to point to different load balancer instances or IP addresses based on user location and the associated certificate shard.
*   **Load Balancer Awareness:** Load balancers must be configured to support multiple TLS certificates and select the appropriate certificate based on incoming request attributes (e.g., client IP address).

**2. Operation:**

1.  **Initial Configuration:**  The system administrator defines geographic regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia) and associates each region with a set of load balancer instances or IP addresses.
2.  **Certificate Shard Generation:** The Certificate Shard Manager automatically generates certificate shards for each defined geographic region. These shards can be optimized for regional trust roots, key sizes, or certificate authorities.
3.  **GeoDNS Updates:** The GeoDNS Integration Module dynamically updates GeoDNS records. When a user requests a domain, GeoDNS resolves to the load balancer instance or IP address associated with the user’s geographic region.
4.  **TLS Handshake:** The load balancer selects the appropriate certificate shard based on the resolved IP address (or other request attribute) and presents it during the TLS handshake.
5.  **Automatic Renewal:**  The Certificate Shard Manager automatically renews each certificate shard before its expiration date, ensuring continuous security.

**3. Pseudocode (Certificate Shard Manager – Renewal Process):**

```
function renew_certificate_shards() {
  shards = get_all_certificate_shards()

  for each shard in shards {
    if (shard.expiration_date < (current_date + renewal_threshold)) {
      region = shard.geographic_region
      csr = generate_csr(region)  //CSR includes region-specific information
      certificate = request_certificate(csr)
      store_certificate(certificate, region)
      update_geodns_records(region, new_certificate)
      log("Certificate renewed for region: " + region)
    }
  }
}

function generate_csr(region) {
    //Generate CSR, including region-specific Subject Alternative Names (SANs)
    //potentially include region-specific Extended Key Usage (EKU) values
    //Example: SANs = {domain.com, region.domain.com}
}
```

**4. Data Structures:**

*   `CertificateShard`:
    *   `shard_id`: Unique identifier for the shard.
    *   `domain`: The domain the certificate covers.
    *   `geographic_region`: The geographic region the shard is optimized for.
    *   `certificate_data`: The certificate data.
    *   `expiration_date`: The certificate expiration date.

*   `GeoDnsMapping`:
    *   `region`: Geographic region.
    *   `load_balancer_ips`: List of load balancer IPs for the region.



**Rationale:** This provides increased performance via lower TLS handshake latency due to regional certificate optimization, and improves resilience via geographically isolated certificate failures. It offers granular control and optimization opportunities beyond simply relying on a single, global certificate.
