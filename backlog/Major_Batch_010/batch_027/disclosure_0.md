## Biometric-Augmented Transactional 'Shadowing'

**Concept:** Expand duress signature detection beyond simple signature comparison to a system that *actively* monitors and ‘shadows’ a user’s typical transaction patterns *before* a signature is even requested, flagging anomalies as potential duress indicators. This isn't just detecting a forced signature; it's detecting a forced *transaction*.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Baseline Establishment Module:**
    *   **Data Collection:** Gathers data across multiple modalities during ‘normal’ transactions. This includes:
        *   Keystroke dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, pressure).
        *   Mouse/trackpad movement patterns (speed, acceleration, path complexity).
        *   Device orientation/movement (using internal sensors – accelerometer, gyroscope).
        *   Transaction details (amount, recipient, time of day, frequency).
        *   Communication patterns (tone analysis of voice/video calls preceding the transaction – sentiment, stress levels).
    *   **Profile Creation:** Constructs a personalized behavioral profile for each user, establishing statistically significant ranges for each collected data point. Utilizes machine learning (specifically, anomaly detection algorithms – Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to learn user-specific patterns.
    *   **Continuous Learning:** The baseline profile is continuously updated with each normal transaction to adapt to evolving user behavior.

2.  **Shadowing Module:**
    *   **Pre-Transaction Monitoring:** *Before* a signature request, the system begins passively monitoring the user’s activity, collecting the same data as the baseline establishment module.
    *   **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:**  Compares the real-time data to the user’s baseline profile.  Deviations exceeding predefined thresholds trigger ‘shadowing alerts’.
    *   **Severity Scoring:**  Assigns severity scores to each anomaly based on the degree of deviation and the importance of the associated data point (e.g., a large deviation in transaction amount receives a higher score than a slight variation in keystroke speed).

3.  **Signature Request Augmentation Module:**
    *   **Dynamic Duress Flag:**  The cumulative severity score from the shadowing module is used to dynamically adjust a ‘duress flag’. This flag isn't binary but a continuous value representing the likelihood of duress.
    *   **Adaptive Challenge System:** Based on the duress flag, the system dynamically adjusts the level of challenge required for the signature:
        *   **Low Duress:** Standard signature process.
        *   **Medium Duress:** Additional authentication factor (e.g., biometric scan, security question).
        *   **High Duress:** Transaction temporarily suspended, security personnel alerted, user contacted via a pre-defined secure channel.
    *   **Signature Data Enrichment:** The signature data is enriched with the shadowing data (severity score, anomaly details) for forensic analysis and incident investigation.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Baseline Establishment (performed periodically)
function establishBaseline(user) {
  data = collectUserActivityData(user)
  profile = createBehavioralProfile(data)
  storeProfile(user, profile)
}

// Real-Time Shadowing
function shadowTransaction(user, transactionDetails) {
  data = collectUserActivityData(user)
  profile = retrieveProfile(user)
  anomalies = detectAnomalies(data, profile)
  severityScore = calculateSeverityScore(anomalies)
  return severityScore
}

// Signature Augmentation
function augmentSignature(signature, transactionDetails, user) {
  severityScore = shadowTransaction(user, transactionDetails)
  if (severityScore > thresholdMedium) {
    requireAdditionalAuthentication(user)
  }
  if (severityScore > thresholdHigh) {
    suspendTransaction(transactionDetails)
    alertSecurityPersonnel(transactionDetails, user)
  }
  enrichedSignature = signature + severityScore + anomalies
  return enrichedSignature
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Standard webcam/microphone for audio/video analysis.
*   Device with accelerometer/gyroscope (most modern smartphones/laptops).
*   Secure enclave for storing and processing biometric data.

**Novelty:** Existing duress signature systems focus on verifying the *signature itself*. This system proactively assesses the *circumstances surrounding the transaction* before a signature is even requested, providing an earlier and more comprehensive duress detection mechanism. It moves from reactive verification to proactive prevention.
