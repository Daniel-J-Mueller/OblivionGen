## Dynamic Quorum Composition Based on Risk Assessment

**Specification:**

**1. System Overview:**

The system builds upon the existing quorum-based access control, adding a layer of dynamic risk assessment to modulate quorum composition *in real-time*.  Instead of a static list of quorum members, membership adjusts based on the sensitivity of the requested operation *and* the current risk profile of each potential quorum member.

**2. Core Components:**

*   **Risk Assessment Engine:** Continuously monitors and calculates a risk score for each user/account. Factors include:
    *   Geographic location (deviation from normal patterns).
    *   Time of access (outside of normal working hours).
    *   Accessing resource sensitivity (classification of the target resource).
    *   Device posture (security status of the accessing device).
    *   Behavioral anomalies (deviation from established user behavior profiles â€“ e.g., sudden large data access, unusual command sequences).
*   **Operation Sensitivity Classifier:**  Analyzes each access control request and assigns a sensitivity level (Low, Medium, High, Critical).  This classification utilizes a knowledge base of resource types, data classifications, and permitted actions.
*   **Dynamic Quorum Manager:**  The core component.  It receives the operation sensitivity level and the real-time risk scores of all potential quorum members.  It then selects the quorum members based on the following algorithm:

    ```pseudocode
    function selectQuorum(operationSensitivity, riskScores, totalQuorumSize):
        sortedRiskScores = sort(riskScores) // ascending order
        quorum = []
        for i in range(totalQuorumSize):
            quorum.append(sortedRiskScores[i]) // Select lowest risk members
        if operationSensitivity == "High" or operationSensitivity == "Critical":
            // Introduce randomness to prevent collusion
            random.shuffle(quorum)
        return quorum
    ```

**3.  Workflow:**

1.  User requests an access control operation.
2.  Operation Sensitivity Classifier determines the sensitivity level.
3.  Risk Assessment Engine calculates the risk score for each potential quorum member.
4.  Dynamic Quorum Manager selects the quorum members based on risk scores and sensitivity level.
5.  Approval requests are sent to the selected quorum members.
6.  Access control operation is performed if quorum approval is achieved.

**4.  Data Structures:**

*   `UserRiskProfile`:  {userId: string, riskScore: float, lastUpdated: timestamp}
*   `OperationSensitivity`: {operationName: string, sensitivityLevel: enum(Low, Medium, High, Critical)}
*   `QuorumConfig`: {accountId: string, totalQuorumSize: int}

**5.  API Endpoints:**

*   `/risk/update`:  Updates the risk score for a given user.  (POST)
*   `/operation/classify`: Classifies the sensitivity of an operation. (POST)
*   `/quorum/select`:  Returns the selected quorum members for a given request. (POST)
*   `/quorum/config/get`: Returns the quorum configuration. (GET)



**6.  Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Adaptive Quorum Size:** Dynamically adjust the total quorum size based on the risk assessment.
*   **Geographic Diversity:** Ensure quorum members are geographically dispersed.
*   **Skill-Based Quorum:**  Select quorum members with specific expertise relevant to the requested operation.
*   **Automated Threat Response:** Integrate with a security information and event management (SIEM) system to automatically adjust quorum composition in response to detected threats.
