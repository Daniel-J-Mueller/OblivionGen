## Adaptive Firewall Profiling via Behavioral Cloning

**Concept:** Expand upon the idea of collective firewall decision-making (allowing/denying connections) by introducing a behavioral cloning system. Instead of *just* collecting decisions, model the decision-making *process* of expert security analysts. This allows the firewall to autonomously adapt to novel threats and proactively block suspicious activity based on learned behavior, not just reactive rules.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Acquisition & Feature Engineering:**
    *   Capture network traffic data (headers, payload metadata, connection characteristics) *and* corresponding expert analyst decisions (allow/deny, severity score, mitigation actions).
    *   Extract features from the network traffic:
        *   IP reputation scores (from threat intelligence feeds)
        *   Protocol analysis (TLS version, cipher suites, flags)
        *   Packet size distribution
        *   Connection duration
        *   Source/destination port ranges
        *   Payload entropy
        *   Time-based features (time of day, day of week)
    *   Create a dataset of (features, analyst decision) pairs.

2.  **Behavior Cloning Model:**
    *   Implement a supervised learning model (e.g., a deep neural network, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting Machine).
    *   The model will be trained to *predict* the analyst's decision given the network traffic features.
    *   Consider incorporating attention mechanisms to highlight the most relevant features driving the decision.
    *   Regularly retrain the model with new data to maintain accuracy and adapt to evolving threats.

3.  **Firewall Integration & Autonomous Operation:**
    *   Deploy the trained model *within* the host-based firewall.
    *   For each incoming connection attempt, extract the relevant features.
    *   The model predicts the "analyst decision" (probability of allowing/denying).
    *   Set a threshold: if the predicted probability of *denying* exceeds the threshold, block the connection.  Allow otherwise.
    *   Implement a confidence score for the prediction. Low confidence scores should trigger additional logging/analysis.

4.  **Feedback Loop & Active Learning:**
    *   Monitor the firewall’s actions and analyst overrides.
    *   When an analyst overrides a firewall decision, treat this as new training data.
    *   Implement active learning: identify connections where the model is most uncertain and request manual labeling from an analyst.
    *   Continuously refine the model based on this feedback.

5.  **Anomaly Detection & Proactive Blocking:**
    *   Track the distribution of feature vectors seen by the firewall.
    *   Identify connections with feature vectors significantly different from the historical distribution (outliers).
    *   Treat these as potentially malicious and block them, even if the model doesn’t explicitly predict denial.

**Pseudocode (Firewall Processing):**

```
function process_connection(connection_data):
    features = extract_features(connection_data)
    prediction = behavior_clone_model.predict(features)
    deny_probability = prediction[0]

    if deny_probability > deny_threshold:
        block_connection(connection_data)
        log_event("Connection blocked by AI - high deny probability")
    else:
        allow_connection(connection_data)
        log_event("Connection allowed by AI")

    #Anomaly detection
    anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(features)
    if anomaly_score > anomaly_threshold:
        block_connection(connection_data)
        log_event("Connection blocked - anomaly detected")
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Sufficient CPU/GPU resources for model training and inference.
*   Large storage capacity for training data and model checkpoints.
*   Scalable infrastructure for distributing the model to multiple firewalls.
*   Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn.
*   Network monitoring tools for data collection.
