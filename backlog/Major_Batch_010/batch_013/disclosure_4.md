## Dynamic Suppression Weighting Based on Real-Time Behavioral Signals

**Concept:** Expand the suppression rules beyond static thresholds (returns, complaints, missing info) to incorporate real-time user behavioral data.  This allows for a more nuanced and adaptive suppression system, decreasing false positives and increasing the effectiveness of hiding problematic listings.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion Layer:**

*   **Input Streams:**
    *   `Page View Events`: Timestamp, User ID, Item ID, Session ID, Device Type, Geographic Location.
    *   `Add-to-Cart Events`: Timestamp, User ID, Item ID, Quantity.
    *   `Purchase Events`: Timestamp, User ID, Item ID, Quantity, Price.
    *   `Return Events`: Timestamp, User ID, Item ID, Return Reason Code.
    *   `Complaint Events`: Timestamp, User ID, Item ID, Complaint Category, Complaint Text (processed via NLP for sentiment/topic).
    *   `Search Query Logs`: Timestamp, User ID, Search Term, Results Displayed, Clicked Results.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, validate, and transform incoming event data.  Apply anonymization/pseudonymization techniques as needed for privacy.

**2.  Behavioral Signal Calculation Module:**

*   **Time Window:** Define a rolling time window (e.g., 1 hour, 12 hours, 24 hours) for calculating behavioral signals.
*   **Signal Generation:** Calculate the following signals for each item within the defined time window:
    *   `Page View Velocity`: Rate of page views (page views / time unit).
    *   `Add-to-Cart Rate`:  (Add-to-Cart Events / Page View Events).
    *   `Purchase Rate`: (Purchase Events / Page View Events).
    *   `Return Rate`: (Return Events / Purchase Events).
    *   `Complaint Rate`: (Complaint Events / Page View Events).  NLP analysis of complaint text determines complaint *severity* (scale 1-5), contributing a weighted value.
    *   `Bounce Rate`: Percentage of users who view the item page and immediately leave.
    *   `Dwell Time`: Average time users spend on the item page.
    *   `Scroll Depth`: Average percentage of the item page that users scroll through.
    *   `Negative Interaction Ratio`: (Bounce Rate + (1 - Scroll Depth) + (1 - Dwell Time)) / 3

**3. Dynamic Weighting & Suppression Engine:**

*   **Suppression Rule Definition:** Define suppression rules that incorporate behavioral signals *with* static thresholds.  Rules are structured as:
    ```
    IF (Return Rate > X) OR (Complaint Severity > Y) OR (Negative Interaction Ratio > Z) OR (Missing Image = TRUE) THEN Suppress = TRUE
    ```
    Each signal component within the rule is assigned a weight.  Weights can be adjusted dynamically.
*   **Weight Adjustment Algorithm:** Employ a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to dynamically adjust the weights assigned to each behavioral signal.
    *   **Reward Function:**  Reward the algorithm for suppressing listings that lead to fewer returns/complaints, and for *not* suppressing good listings.
    *   **State:** The state is defined by the current values of the behavioral signals for a given listing.
    *   **Action:** The action is adjusting the weight assigned to a specific behavioral signal.
*   **Suppression Flag Management:** When a listing meets the suppression criteria, set a flag in the search index to exclude it from search results.

**4.  Real-time Monitoring & Alerting:**

*   **Dashboard:** Provide a real-time dashboard to monitor key metrics (suppression rates, return rates, complaint rates, click-through rates).
*   **Alerting:** Configure alerts to notify administrators when suppression rates exceed a certain threshold, or when a specific listing is repeatedly suppressed.



**Pseudocode (Weight Adjustment):**

```
// Q-learning parameters
learning_rate = 0.1
discount_factor = 0.9
exploration_rate = 0.1

// Initialize Q-table (Q(state, action))
Q = {}

// Main Loop
for each listing in catalog:
  state = (Return Rate, Complaint Rate, Negative Interaction Ratio) // current behavioral signals

  // Explore or Exploit
  if random() < exploration_rate:
    action = random_action() // choose a random signal to adjust
  else:
    action = argmax_action(Q[state]) // choose the action with the highest Q-value

  // Adjust signal weight
  new_weight = current_weight + adjustment_amount

  // Observe reward
  reward = calculate_reward(new_weight, listing) // based on returns/complaints after weight adjustment

  // Update Q-value
  Q[state, action] = Q[state, action] + learning_rate * (reward + discount_factor * max(Q[next_state, :]) - Q[state, action])

  // Update signal weight
  signal_weight[signal] = new_weight
```
