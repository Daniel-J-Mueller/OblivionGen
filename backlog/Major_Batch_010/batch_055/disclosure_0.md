## Adaptive Interference Cancellation via Distributed Phased Array

**Specification:** Wireless device incorporating a distributed phased array system for proactive interference cancellation based on predictive modeling of interference sources.

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond reactive signal/noise ratio improvements to *predict* interference and null it *before* it impacts signal reception.  This utilizes a network of low-cost antenna elements distributed around the device’s perimeter, creating a synthetic aperture.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Distributed Antenna Array:**  Minimum of 8, ideally 16+ microstrip antenna elements integrated into the device’s housing. Elements positioned for maximum spatial diversity.  Low-power, digitally controlled phase shifters associated with each element.
*   **Edge AI Processing Unit:** Dedicated low-power AI accelerator (e.g. a neural engine) capable of running inference on a trained interference prediction model.  This is *not* a general-purpose CPU.
*   **Micro-Radar Module:**  A short-range, low-power radar module to detect movement and proximity of potential interference sources (other devices, people).  Frequency range: 60-68 GHz.
*   **Data Storage:** Small capacity flash memory to store pre-trained AI model weights, calibration data, and recent interference history.
*   **Power Management Unit:**  Dynamically allocate power to antenna array, AI processor, and radar module based on interference prediction confidence.

**Software/Algorithm:**

1.  **Training Phase (Offline):** Collect a large dataset of RF environments – various locations, device densities, and interference patterns. Train a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, an LSTM – to predict future interference based on historical RF data, micro-radar data (detecting moving sources), and device location (GPS/IMU).  The model outputs predicted interference direction-of-arrival (DoA) and amplitude.
2.  **Real-Time Prediction:**
    *   Micro-radar continuously scans for nearby moving objects.
    *   RF signal strength is sampled from the distributed antenna array.
    *   LSTM model processes radar and RF data to predict future interference (DoA and amplitude).
3.  **Beamforming & Null Steering:**
    *   Digital beamforming weights are calculated for each antenna element based on the predicted interference direction and amplitude.
    *   Phase shifters adjust the antenna element signals to create a null in the direction of the predicted interference.  Simultaneously, the signal from the desired source is constructively reinforced.
4.  **Adaptive Learning:** The LSTM model is continuously refined using a reinforcement learning approach. The reward function is based on signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) improvement. The model learns to adapt to new and changing interference environments.

**Pseudocode (Beamforming):**

```
// Input: Predicted Interference Direction (angle), Predicted Interference Amplitude,
//        Array of Antenna Element Positions, Desired Signal Direction, 
//        Desired Signal Strength

// Calculate phase shift for each antenna element to create a null at the interference direction
for each antenna_element in antenna_array:
    distance = calculate_distance(antenna_element.position, interference_direction)
    phase_shift[antenna_element] = -1 * (2 * PI / wavelength) * distance

// Calculate phase shift for each antenna element to reinforce desired signal
for each antenna_element in antenna_array:
    distance = calculate_distance(antenna_element.position, desired_signal_direction)
    phase_shift[antenna_element] += (2 * PI / wavelength) * distance

// Apply phase shifts to antenna signals
for each antenna_element in antenna_array:
    antenna_element.signal = phase_shift(antenna_element.signal, phase_shift[antenna_element])

// Combine signals to form the received signal.
received_signal = combine_signals(antenna_array.signals)
```

**Power Optimization:**

*   The AI processor operates in a low-power mode when interference is minimal.
*   The number of active antenna elements is dynamically adjusted based on the interference prediction confidence.
*   Radar module operates at reduced scan rate during periods of low activity.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Improved performance in crowded RF environments (e.g., stadiums, airports).
*   Enhanced reliability of wireless communication in critical applications (e.g., drone control, industrial automation).
*   Reduced power consumption and extended battery life for mobile devices.
