## Adaptive Quorum Based on User Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:** Implement a system where quorum requirements for account promotion are dynamically adjusted based on real-time behavioral biometrics of approving users. This goes beyond simply requiring *a* quorum – it evaluates *how* those approvals are made.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Biometric Engine:** Continuously monitors and analyzes approving users’ interaction patterns during the approval process. Data points include:
    *   Typing speed & rhythm
    *   Mouse movement (speed, trajectory, hesitations)
    *   Scroll behavior
    *   Time spent reviewing information before approving/rejecting
    *   Device posture (if available - accelerometer/gyroscope data)
2.  **Baseline Profiler:**  Creates individualized behavioral baselines for each approving user based on their historical activity data.
3.  **Anomaly Detection Module:** Identifies deviations from a user’s established behavioral baseline *during* the approval process. Significant deviations are flagged as potential indicators of duress, compromise, or inattentiveness.
4.  **Dynamic Quorum Adjustment:**
    *   **High Confidence (Minimal Deviation):** If multiple approving users exhibit high confidence (minimal behavioral deviation), the required quorum can be *reduced*.  The system trusts the collective decision-making is sound, even with fewer approvals.
    *   **Low Confidence (Significant Deviation):** If multiple approving users exhibit low confidence (significant deviations), the required quorum is *increased*, or the approval request is automatically flagged for secondary review by a designated authority.
    *   **Mixed Confidence:**  If confidence levels are mixed, a weighted quorum calculation is applied, giving more weight to approvals from users with high confidence scores.
5.  **Real-time Confidence Score:** Each approving user receives a real-time confidence score during the approval process. This score is based on the degree of deviation from their established baseline.
6.  **Audit Trail:** All confidence scores, behavioral data, and quorum adjustments are logged for auditing purposes.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateQuorum(approvalRequests, approvingUsers)
    initialQuorum = GetInitialQuorum(targetUser)  // From promotion rules
    confidenceScores = {}
    
    FOR EACH user IN approvingUsers
        confidenceScore = AnalyzeBehavior(user) // Real-time biometric analysis
        confidenceScores[user] = confidenceScore

    averageConfidence = CalculateAverage(confidenceScores.values())

    IF averageConfidence > 0.8  //High Confidence
        adjustedQuorum = initialQuorum * 0.75  //Reduce quorum
    ELSE IF averageConfidence < 0.5 //Low Confidence
        adjustedQuorum = initialQuorum * 1.5 //Increase quorum
    ELSE
        adjustedQuorum = initialQuorum
    
    requiredApprovals = Ceil(adjustedQuorum)
    
    RETURN requiredApprovals
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The Behavioral Biometric Engine needs to be privacy-preserving. Data should be anonymized and aggregated where possible.
*   Machine learning models will need to be trained to accurately detect behavioral anomalies.
*   The system must be robust against adversarial attacks designed to spoof behavioral biometrics.
*   Consider integrating this with existing multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems.
*   The thresholds for “high” and “low” confidence will need to be tuned based on experimentation and data analysis.
