## Dynamic Access 'Chaining' & Temporal Permissions

**Concept:** Expand upon the out-of-band credential delivery by introducing a system where access isn’t a single authentication event, but a *chain* of permissions granted over time, dynamically adjusted based on observed user behavior and contextual factors. This moves beyond simple confidence scoring to active, adaptive permission control.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component:** ‘Permission Orchestrator’ – a microservice managing permission chains.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `PermissionNode`: Contains:
        *   `credentialType`: (e.g., SMS code, biometric scan, device ID check, time-based unlock)
        *   `validationLogic`: Function pointer or microservice endpoint for validating the credential.
        *   `timeout`: Duration after which this node expires.
        *   `nextNodes`: List of subsequent `PermissionNode` IDs to unlock upon successful validation.
        *   `accessLevel`: Specifies the type of access granted if this node *and all subsequent nodes* are validated (e.g., view-only, download, edit).
    *   `PermissionChain`:  List of `PermissionNode` IDs, representing the sequence of authentications.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Initial request for document access triggers creation of a `PermissionChain` via the Permission Orchestrator. This chain is tailored based on pre-defined policies, user role, and document sensitivity.
    2.  First `PermissionNode` credential delivery (e.g., SMS code).
    3.  User provides credential. Orchestrator validates via `validationLogic`.
    4.  If valid, Orchestrator unlocks the next `PermissionNode` in the chain (delivering the next credential/challenge) to the user’s device.
    5.  If invalid, access is denied, and the chain is terminated.  Reporting mechanisms are engaged.
    6.  Successful completion of the entire chain unlocks access to the document with the specified `accessLevel`.
    7.  **Adaptive Adjustment:** Ongoing monitoring of user behavior (typing speed, mouse movements, data access patterns) is correlated with risk factors. The Orchestrator can *dynamically adjust* the chain *during* access. For example:
        *   If unusual activity is detected, a new `PermissionNode` is *inserted* into the chain requiring re-authentication.
        *   If behavior is consistently normal, `PermissionNode`s can be *removed* to streamline access.
*   **Credential Types:**
    *   Standard: SMS code, email link, password.
    *   Biometric: Fingerprint, facial recognition.
    *   Geofencing: Access granted only within specific geographic locations.
    *   Device Health: Verification of device security posture (OS version, antivirus status).
    *   Behavioral Biometrics: Typing rhythm, mouse movements.
    *   Time-based unlocks (access expires automatically)
*   **Pseudocode (Orchestrator – `validateNode` function):**

```
function validateNode(userId, nodeId, credential):
  node = getNode(nodeId)
  if not node:
    return false // Node not found

  if validateCredential(node.credentialType, credential):
    // Log validation success
    if node.nextNodes is empty:
      // End of chain – grant access
      grantAccess(userId, documentId, node.accessLevel)
      return true
    else:
      // Unlock next node
      unlockNextNode(userId, node.nextNodes[0])
      return true
  else:
    // Log validation failure
    terminateChain(userId)
    return false

function unlockNextNode(userId, nodeId):
  // Trigger delivery of the next credential to the user's device.
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **User Experience:** The system should be designed to minimize friction for legitimate users while maximizing security.
*   **Auditing:** All authentication events and permission adjustments should be logged for auditing purposes.
*   **Scalability:** The Permission Orchestrator should be able to handle a large number of users and documents.
*   **Integration:** Seamless integration with existing document management and collaboration systems is crucial.
