## Adaptive Encryption Granularity & Dynamic Key Rotation

**Concept:** Instead of fixed hierarchical encryption levels with predetermined keys, implement a system where encryption granularity *adapts* based on data sensitivity *and* usage patterns, coupled with a dynamic key rotation schedule influenced by access logs.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Sensitivity Profiling:**

*   **Module:** `SensitivityAnalyzer`
*   **Functionality:**  Scans incoming data, leveraging metadata (file type, origin, user tags) *and* content analysis (keyword detection, statistical anomaly detection).  Assigns a sensitivity score (1-10) to each data element. This score dictates the *minimum* level of encryption required.  The module utilizes machine learning models trained on labeled data to improve accuracy.

**2. Dynamic Encryption Map:**

*   **Data Structure:**  `EncryptionMap` –  A hierarchical map where each node represents a data element (or block) and contains:
    *   `sensitivityScore`:  Integer (1-10)
    *   `encryptionLevel`: Integer (1-N, N being maximum possible level) – Determined by `sensitivityScore` and usage patterns.
    *   `keyID`:  Integer –  Identifier for the cryptographic key used.
    *   `accessLog`: List of timestamps and user IDs accessing this data element.

**3. Adaptive Encryption Engine:**

*   **Module:** `EncryptionEngine`
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Receives data and `EncryptionMap` as input.
    *   Applies encryption based on `encryptionLevel` specified in `EncryptionMap` for each data element.
    *   Supports multiple encryption algorithms (AES, ChaCha20, etc.).
    *   Dynamically adjusts `encryptionLevel` based on usage patterns observed in `accessLog`.  If a highly sensitive element is rarely accessed, `encryptionLevel` can be temporarily reduced to improve performance.

**4. Dynamic Key Rotation:**

*   **Module:** `KeyManager`
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Maintains a pool of cryptographic keys.
    *   Rotates keys based on:
        *   A time-based schedule.
        *   Access patterns: If a key is used frequently, it’s rotated more often.
        *   Security events: If a breach is detected, all related keys are immediately rotated.
    *   The KeyManager must seamlessly re-encrypt data blocks using new keys without disrupting access.  Utilizes techniques like online encryption to avoid downtime.

**5. Access Control & Audit:**

*   **Module:** `AccessController`
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Enforces access control policies.
    *   Audits all access attempts and records them in a security log.
    *   Integrates with the `KeyManager` to verify that the user has the necessary permissions to access the data with the current key.

**Pseudocode (Key Rotation):**

```
function rotateKey(dataBlock, oldKeyID, newKeyID) {
  if (dataBlock.isEncrypted(oldKeyID)) {
    //Re-encrypt the data block using the new key.
    encryptedData = encrypt(dataBlock.data, newKeyID);
    dataBlock.data = encryptedData;
    dataBlock.keyID = newKeyID;
    log("Key rotated for data block. Old Key ID: " + oldKeyID + ", New Key ID: " + newKeyID);
  }
}

function performKeyRotation(dataBlockList, rotationInterval) {
  currentTime = getCurrentTime();
  for (block in dataBlockList) {
    if (block.lastKeyRotationTime + rotationInterval < currentTime) {
      newKeyID = generateNewKey();
      rotateKey(block, block.keyID, newKeyID);
      block.lastKeyRotationTime = currentTime;
    }
  }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `DataBlock`: { `data`: encrypted data, `keyID`: integer, `lastKeyRotationTime`: timestamp, `sensitivityScore`: integer }
*   `EncryptionMap`:  Hierarchical map of DataBlocks.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Use a key management service (KMS) to securely store and manage cryptographic keys.
*   Implement online encryption to minimize downtime during key rotation.
*   Monitor system performance and adjust parameters (rotation interval, sensitivity thresholds) accordingly.
*   Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs) to further enhance key security.
