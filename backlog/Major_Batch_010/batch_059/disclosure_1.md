## Data Set Shadowing with Predictive Pre-Capture

**Concept:** Extend the data set capture functionality by introducing "shadowing" – continuously replicating *changes* to the data set in the second data store *before* a scheduled full capture. Combine this with predictive pre-capture, anticipating data modification hotspots to proactively initiate shadowing.

**Specs:**

**1. Change Tracking Module:**

*   **Input:** First data store (primary), Data set identifier.
*   **Process:** Monitor the primary data store for changes to the specified data set. Utilize a change data capture (CDC) mechanism (e.g., database transaction logs, triggers).
*   **Output:**  Stream of change records (e.g., modified row, deleted object). Timestamped.

**2. Shadowing Engine:**

*   **Input:** Stream of change records, Second data store (shadow), Shadowing policy (configurable).
*   **Process:** Apply change records to the shadow data store.  Policy dictates:
    *   **Replication Lag Tolerance:** Maximum acceptable delay between changes in primary and shadow.
    *   **Conflict Resolution:** Strategy for handling concurrent modifications (e.g., last-write-wins, merge).
    *   **Filtering:**  Ability to exclude specific data elements or types from shadowing.
*   **Output:**  Shadow data store continuously updated with changes from the primary.

**3. Predictive Pre-Capture Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical access patterns (from logs, monitoring data), Data set schema, Shadowing policy, Resource Utilization Forecast.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Hotspot Identification:** Analyze historical data to identify data elements frequently modified during specific time periods.  Employ time-series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).
    *   **Predictive Shadowing:**  Initiate or accelerate shadowing for identified hotspots *before* scheduled captures.
    *   **Dynamic Policy Adjustment:** Based on resource utilization forecast, dynamically adjust the aggressiveness of predictive shadowing. During periods of high load, reduce shadowing to minimize impact.
*   **Output:** Instructions for the Shadowing Engine (e.g., “Prioritize replication of table X for the next hour”).

**4. Capture Orchestration:**

*   **Input:** Shadowing Engine Status, Schedule, Resource Utilization Forecast.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Delta Capture:**  At scheduled capture time, perform a delta capture – only transfer changes *since* the last capture. The Shadowing Engine provides the change set.
    *   **Validation:** Verify data consistency between primary and shadow.
    *   **Rollback Strategy:** If validation fails, rollback to a known-good state.

**Pseudocode - Predictive Pre-Capture Module:**

```pseudocode
function predict_hotspots(historical_data, schema):
  // Time series analysis to identify frequently modified data elements
  hotspot_candidates = analyze_timeseries(historical_data)
  filtered_candidates = filter_candidates(hotspot_candidates, schema) // based on data type, size, etc
  return filtered_candidates

function adjust_shadowing_policy(resource_utilization_forecast, current_policy):
  if resource_utilization_forecast > threshold:
    // Reduce shadowing aggressiveness (e.g., lower replication lag tolerance)
    new_policy = reduce_aggressiveness(current_policy)
  else:
    new_policy = current_policy
  return new_policy

// Main loop
while True:
  historical_data = get_historical_access_patterns()
  hotspots = predict_hotspots(historical_data, schema)
  resource_utilization = get_resource_utilization_forecast()
  shadowing_policy = adjust_shadowing_policy(resource_utilization, current_policy)
  send_instructions_to_shadowing_engine(hotspots, shadowing_policy)
  sleep(interval)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced capture time due to delta capture.
*   Lower probability of data loss.
*   Improved resource utilization.
*   Reduced impact of captures on production systems.
