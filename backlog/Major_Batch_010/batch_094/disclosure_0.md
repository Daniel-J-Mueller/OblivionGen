## Dynamic Garment Simulation with Environmental Influence

**Concept:** Expand the 3D modeling and virtual try-on system to incorporate real-time environmental simulation impacting garment behavior. This moves beyond static draping to include factors like wind, humidity, and even simulated movement (walking, running) affecting how clothing looks and behaves on the virtual avatar.

**Specs:**

**1. Environmental Data Input:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate APIs for real-time weather data (wind speed/direction, humidity, temperature) based on user location (or specified location). Allow manual override/setting of environmental parameters.
*   **Data Mapping:** Define parameters for how each environmental factor affects different fabric types. (e.g., high wind + lightweight silk = significant billowing; high humidity + cotton = clinging/wrinkling). Create a lookup table for material properties & environmental responses.

**2. Garment Physics Engine Enhancement:**

*   **Aerodynamics Module:** Implement an aerodynamics module within the existing simulation engine. This module should calculate air resistance and lift forces on garment surfaces based on wind speed, direction, and garment geometry.
*   **Moisture Absorption/Diffusion:**  Model moisture absorption and diffusion within fabric materials. Higher humidity should affect fabric weight, drape, and transparency (for thinner materials).
*   **Dynamic Mesh Deformation:**  Implement a more robust dynamic mesh deformation system capable of handling complex deformations caused by wind, moisture, and simulated movement. Use a combination of finite element analysis (FEA) and particle-based simulation.

**3. Avatar Movement Integration:**

*   **Motion Capture/Animation Pipeline:**  Integrate a motion capture system or animation pipeline to drive avatar movements (walking, running, jumping). 
*   **Garment-Avatar Interaction:**  Implement collision detection and response between the garment and the avatar’s body. Ensure that garments move realistically with the avatar’s movements (e.g., sleeves billowing during running, skirts swaying with walking).
*   **Muscle/Fat Simulation (Optional):** Incorporate basic muscle and fat simulation beneath the skin to influence garment drape and fit, creating a more realistic appearance.

**4. Rendering & Visual Feedback:**

*   **Shader Development:**  Develop custom shaders to simulate the visual effects of wind, moisture, and fabric deformation (e.g., wrinkles, billowing, wetness).
*   **Real-Time Rendering:** Optimize the rendering pipeline for real-time performance, even with complex simulations.
*   **Interactive Controls:** Provide users with interactive controls to adjust environmental parameters and view the effects on the garment in real-time. (e.g., wind direction slider, humidity control)

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// For each garment component:
For each vertex in component.mesh:
    WindForce = CalculateWindForce(vertex.position, windSpeed, windDirection, component.dragCoefficient)
    MoistureEffect = CalculateMoistureEffect(component.material, humidity)
    VertexForce = WindForce + MoistureEffect
    Vertex.position += VertexForce * deltaTime
End For
Update component.mesh with new vertex positions
Render component
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus primarily on static draping or simple physics simulations. This expands into a fully dynamic simulation environment that realistically models garment behavior under a variety of external conditions and avatar movements, enabling a more immersive and accurate virtual try-on experience.  The inclusion of environmental factors adds a layer of realism previously unseen in this space.
