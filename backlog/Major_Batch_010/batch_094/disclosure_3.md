## Adaptive Payload Prioritization & Execution

**Concept:** Extend the virtual partitioning concept to prioritize payload execution based on real-time system load and payload complexity. This goes beyond simply partitioning timers; it actively reshuffles *execution order* within the firing worker based on dynamic factors.

**Specs:**

1.  **Payload Complexity Assessment:**
    *   Each timer creation request includes a “complexity score” (integer, 1-10) assigned by the client. This reflects estimated resource consumption (CPU, memory, network I/O) for the payload.  The system provides a client-facing API for initial score suggestion/calibration.
    *   The system maintains a rolling average of *actual* resource consumption for each client’s payloads. This feedback loop refines the client-provided complexity scores and provides better estimates.
    *   A ‘Complexity Analyzer’ module dynamically adjusts complexity scores based on system load.  High load = inflated scores.

2.  **Execution Queues Per Partition:**  Each virtual partition contains *multiple* priority-based execution queues (e.g., High, Medium, Low). 
    *   Sweeper workers route timers to the appropriate queue within their partition *based on* complexity score *and* current system load.

3.  **Dynamic Load Balancing:**
    *   A 'Firing Worker Coordinator' monitors queue lengths and system load across all partitions.
    *   It dynamically redistributes work by temporarily shifting execution priority across partitions. If one partition's 'High' queue is overflowing, the coordinator might temporarily elevate the 'Medium' queue of a less-loaded partition.
    *   This involves a lightweight inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism for signaling and work transfer.

4.  **Payload Skipping & Degradation:**
    *   If system load remains critically high, the coordinator implements a degradation strategy.  
    *   Low-priority payloads are skipped entirely.
    *   Medium-priority payloads are executed with reduced resources (e.g., shorter timeouts, less data processed).
    *   The client receives a notification if its payload is skipped or degraded.

5.  **Checkpointing & Recovery:**
    *   The Firing Worker Coordinator maintains a record of skipped/degraded payloads. 
    *   When system load decreases, it automatically reschedules execution of these payloads (with adjusted priority).

**Pseudocode (Firing Worker Coordinator):**

```
function manage_firing_workers() {
  while (true) {
    system_load = calculate_system_load();
    
    for each partition in partitions {
      for each queue_priority in [High, Medium, Low] {
        queue_length = partition.get_queue_length(queue_priority);
        
        if (system_load > threshold_high && queue_priority == Low) {
          // Skip Low priority
          partition.disable_queue(Low);
        } else if (system_load > threshold_medium && queue_priority == Medium) {
          //Reduce Resource allocation of Medium
          partition.reduce_resource_allocation(Medium);
        } else {
          // Enable/restore resource allocation
          partition.enable_queue(queue_priority);
        }
      }
    }
    
    //Reschedule Skipped Payloads
    reschedule_skipped_payloads();
    
    sleep(monitoring_interval);
  }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Partition`:  Contains multiple execution queues (High, Medium, Low).  Tracks queue lengths and resource allocation.
*   `PayloadRecord`:  Includes complexity score, client ID, timer expiration time, payload data, and status (scheduled, executing, completed, skipped).
*   `SystemLoadRecord`:  Tracks CPU usage, memory usage, network I/O, and other relevant metrics.
