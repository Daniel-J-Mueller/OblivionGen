## Dynamic Data Provenance with Attestation

**Concept:** Extend static analysis of data flow with runtime attestation to create a dynamic, verifiable data provenance system. Instead of *just* identifying potential data flows, this system actively *proves* data movement and validates adherence to access control policies during execution.

**Specification:**

**1. Attestation Agents:**

*   Deploy lightweight agents (“Attestation Agents”) alongside each data store and service involved in data exchange.
*   These agents monitor all data access and modification operations.
*   Each operation is digitally signed by the agent using a private key, and a corresponding public key is established for verification.

**2. Dynamic Provenance Graph:**

*   A central "Provenance Service" maintains a dynamic graph representing data flow.
*   When an Attestation Agent observes a data operation, it sends a signed "Provenance Event" to the Provenance Service.
*   The Provenance Event contains:
    *   Timestamp
    *   Source Data Store ID
    *   Destination Data Store ID
    *   Service ID (responsible for the operation)
    *   Data Identifier (hash or unique ID of the data)
    *   Operation Type (read, write, delete, etc.)
    *   Digital Signature

**3. Policy Enforcement & Verification:**

*   The Provenance Service receives Provenance Events and:
    *   Verifies the digital signature to ensure authenticity.
    *   Evaluates access control policies relevant to the operation.
    *   If the policy is violated, an alert is triggered.
    *   Constructs and updates the dynamic data provenance graph.

**4. Static Analysis Integration:**

*   Utilize the static analysis from the original patent to *predict* potential data flows.
*   Compare predicted flows with the actual flows observed via the dynamic provenance graph.
*   Discrepancies can indicate:
    *   Policy violations missed by static analysis.
    *   Unexpected or malicious data movement.
    *   Errors in the static analysis configuration.

**5.  Pseudocode – Provenance Service Event Handling:**

```
function handleProvenanceEvent(event) {
  // Verify Signature
  if (!verifySignature(event.signature, event.data, event.agentPublicKey)) {
    log("Signature verification failed for event from " + event.agentId);
    return;
  }

  // Evaluate Access Control Policy
  policyResult = evaluatePolicy(event.sourceDataStore, event.destinationDataStore, event.serviceId, event.dataIdentifier, event.operationType);

  if (policyResult == "VIOLATION") {
    triggerAlert("Policy violation detected: " + event.sourceDataStore + " -> " + event.destinationDataStore);
  }

  // Update Provenance Graph
  addEventToGraph(event);

  // Compare to Static Analysis Prediction (optional)
  predictedFlow = getPredictedFlow(event.sourceDataStore, event.destinationDataStore);
  if (predictedFlow == null || predictedFlow != event) {
    log("Discrepancy between predicted and actual data flow.");
  }
}
```

**6. Data Structures:**

*   **Provenance Graph:** A graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) to store Provenance Events and relationships between data stores, services, and data.
*   **Policy Engine:** A rule-based engine (Drools, Open Policy Agent) to evaluate access control policies.

**7. Scalability & Performance:**

*   Asynchronous event processing to avoid blocking service execution.
*   Distributed Provenance Service to handle large-scale deployments.
*   Caching of frequently accessed policies and data.

**Novelty:**  This system combines the proactive benefits of static analysis with the *verifiable* certainty of runtime attestation, creating a robust and auditable data provenance solution.  It moves beyond identifying potential issues to proving data integrity and compliance.
