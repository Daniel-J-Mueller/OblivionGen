## Decentralized Reputation & Authorization via Blockchain

**Concept:** Extend the existing authorization framework by anchoring client resource identity and authorization status onto a permissioned blockchain. This enables a decentralized, tamper-proof record of authorization, moving beyond centralized control and enhancing security/trust.

**Specifications:**

**1. Blockchain Integration Module:**

*   **Function:**  Manages interaction with the permissioned blockchain. (Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, or similar).
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `ResourceIdentity`:  Includes a unique identifier (derived from existing `resource ID`), public key, and initial security role.
    *   `AuthorizationTransaction`: Records authorization grants, revocations, and role changes. Includes timestamp, authorizing entity, resource identifier, and new security role.
*   **API:**
    *   `registerResource(resourceID, publicKey, initialRole)`:  Creates a `ResourceIdentity` on the blockchain.
    *   `grantAuthorization(resourceID, newRole)`:  Adds an `AuthorizationTransaction` granting a new role.
    *   `revokeAuthorization(resourceID)`: Adds an `AuthorizationTransaction` revoking all roles.
    *   `getAuthorizationStatus(resourceID)`: Queries the blockchain for the latest valid `AuthorizationTransaction` for a resource, returning its current role.
*   **Consensus Mechanism:** Utilize a permissioned blockchain to control network participation and transaction validation.

**2.  Modified Authorization Agent:**

*   **Function:**  Intercepts activation requests and service requests.  Validates authorization against the blockchain before granting access.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Upon receiving an activation request (resource ID, activation code), agent first verifies the activation code with the central authorization service (as before).
    2.  If the activation code is valid, the agent queries the blockchain using `getAuthorizationStatus(resourceID)`.
    3.  If a valid `AuthorizationTransaction` is found, the agent caches the resourceâ€™s current security role.
    4.  For each service request, the agent checks if the resource's cached security role permits access.
    5.  If a cached authorization is invalid or absent (e.g., due to blockchain data inconsistency), a new blockchain query is made.

**3.  Smart Contract Logic:**

*   **Contract Name:** `AuthorizationManager`
*   **Functions:**
    *   `registerResource(resourceID, publicKey, initialRole)`:  Stores `resourceID`, `publicKey`, and `initialRole`.
    *   `grantAuthorization(resourceID, newRole)`: Updates the role associated with `resourceID`.
    *   `revokeAuthorization(resourceID)`: Sets the role to "REVOKED".
    *   `getAuthorizationStatus(resourceID)`: Returns the current role associated with `resourceID`.
*   **Access Control:** Only authorized entities (e.g., the service provider) can call `grantAuthorization` or `revokeAuthorization`.

**4.  Pseudocode for Agent Service Request Interception:**

```
function handleServiceRequest(request):
  resourceID = extractResourceID(request)
  cachedRole = getCachedRole(resourceID)

  if (cachedRole == null or cachedRole is invalid):
    blockchainRole = getAuthorizationStatus(resourceID) //Query blockchain
    if (blockchainRole == null):
      denyRequest() //Resource not authorized
      return
    setCachedRole(resourceID, blockchainRole)

  if (cachedRole permits access):
    forwardRequest(request)
  else:
    denyRequest()
```

**5.  Enhancements:**

*   **Sequence Number Tracking:** Integrate sequence numbers into service requests to detect replay attacks or tampering. Store sequence numbers on the blockchain to provide an immutable audit trail.
*   **Reputation Scoring:**  Implement a reputation system where client resources earn scores based on their behavior.  Integrate reputation scores into the authorization process to dynamically adjust access permissions.
*   **Federated Authorization:**  Enable cross-service authorization by allowing different service providers to share authorization data on the blockchain.
