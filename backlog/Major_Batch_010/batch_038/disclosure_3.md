## Dynamic Segmented Metadata & Predictive Pre-Processing

**Concept:** Extend the filename hashing/segmentation approach to not just storage distribution, but to *proactive* media pre-processing based on predicted user access patterns. The system will dynamically adjust pre-processing pipelines *per segment* based on metadata, anticipated rendering device capabilities, and historical access data.

**Specs:**

**1. Segmented Metadata Database:**

*   **Data Structure:**  A NoSQL database (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) designed for high-volume writes and reads. Each segment (defined by the hashing algorithm from the patent) has an associated metadata document.
*   **Metadata Fields:**
    *   `segment_hash`: The unique hash identifying the segment.
    *   `timestamp`: Segment creation/modification time.
    *   `original_format`:  The format of the segment's source media.
    *   `resolution`: Original resolution of the segment.
    *   `bitrate`: Original bitrate of the segment.
    *   `scene_tags`:  Tags describing the visual content of the segment (determined via AI analysis â€“ object detection, scene classification).
    *   `audio_tags`: Tags describing the audio content (music genre, speech, sound effects).
    *   `access_count`: Number of times this segment has been accessed.
    *   `access_timestamp_array`: Array of timestamps indicating when the segment was accessed.
    *   `rendering_device_array`:  Array of device types used to access the segment.
    *   `predicted_access_probability`:  A probability score calculated by a machine learning model predicting future access to this segment.
    *   `preprocessed_versions`:  An array of pointers to preprocessed versions of this segment.

**2. Predictive Pre-processing Pipeline:**

*   **Trigger:** A background process that runs periodically (e.g., every 5-15 minutes) analyzing segment metadata.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Identify Hot Segments:** Segments with a high `predicted_access_probability` or a rapid increase in `access_count`.
    2.  **Device Profile Analysis:**  Analyze the `rendering_device_array` to determine the most common device profiles accessing hot segments.
    3.  **Format Selection:** Based on device profiles, select appropriate transcoding formats (e.g., H.264, H.265, VP9), resolutions, and bitrates.
    4.  **Dynamic Pipeline Creation:**  Generate a custom FFmpeg (or similar) transcoding pipeline for the segment, optimized for the target device profiles.
    5.  **Parallel Processing:** Distribute transcoding tasks across a cluster of GPU-accelerated servers.
    6.  **Version Storage:** Store the preprocessed versions alongside the original segment, updating the `preprocessed_versions` array in the metadata document.

**3.  Client-Side Integration:**

*   **API Endpoint:** A new API endpoint that clients can query to request the most appropriate segment version based on their device capabilities and current network conditions.
*   **Adaptive Streaming:** Integrate with existing adaptive streaming protocols (e.g., DASH, HLS) to seamlessly switch between different segment versions.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def analyze_segments():
  segments = get_all_segments()
  for segment in segments:
    predict_access(segment)  # ML model predicts future access
    if segment.predicted_access_probability > threshold:
      device_profiles = analyze_device_usage(segment)
      optimal_format = determine_optimal_format(device_profiles)
      if not segment.has_preprocessed_version(optimal_format):
        transcode_segment(segment, optimal_format)
        store_preprocessed_version(segment, optimal_format)

def transcode_segment(segment, format):
  # Construct FFmpeg command based on format
  command = f"ffmpeg -i {segment.path} -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k {segment.path + '.' + format}"
  execute_command(command)

def get_segment_for_client(client_device_profile):
  # Query metadata database for segment with optimal format for the device
  segment = query_database(client_device_profile)
  return segment
```

**Innovation:**  This system moves beyond simply storing media in tiers. It proactively *prepares* media segments for likely access scenarios, resulting in reduced latency and improved user experience. The dynamic pipeline creation allows for fine-grained optimization, adapting to evolving device landscapes and user preferences. It leverages machine learning to predict access patterns, rather than reacting to them, making it a truly intelligent media storage system.
