## Acoustic Mapping via Bio-Inspired Echolocation & Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** A wearable device utilizing ultrasonic phased arrays, bio-inspired by bat echolocation, combined with haptic feedback to create a "spatial awareness" system for the visually impaired, or for enhanced navigation in complex environments. The system goes beyond simply *detecting* obstacles – it aims to *render* the surrounding space through tactile sensation, creating a form of 'spatial vision'.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A lightweight, flexible array of ultrasonic transducers (minimum 64 elements) integrated into a head-worn band or vest.  Transducer frequency range: 40kHz – 100kHz (adjustable).
*   **Waveform Generation:**  System capable of generating both continuous wave (CW) and Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) signals.  FMCW sweep rate adjustable from 10kHz/s to 100kHz/s.  Pulse compression techniques employed for enhanced range resolution with CW signals.
*   **Beamforming Hardware:** Dedicated FPGA-based beamforming processor capable of real-time steering of the ultrasonic beam in both azimuth and elevation.  Minimum 10 beams simultaneously trackable. Beam width adjustable from 2° to 10°.
*   **Signal Processing Pipeline:**
    *   **Time-of-Flight Calculation:**  Accurate time-of-flight measurement using cross-correlation techniques with sub-millisecond resolution.
    *   **Doppler Shift Analysis:** Detection of moving objects via Doppler shift calculation.  Object velocity range: 0.1 m/s to 5 m/s.
    *   **Environmental Mapping:**  Creation of a 3D point cloud representing the surrounding environment.  Maximum range: 5 meters.
    *   **Object Classification:**  Basic object classification using machine learning algorithms trained on ultrasonic signatures (e.g., person, wall, table).
*   **Haptic Feedback System:** Array of miniature vibrotactile actuators (minimum 64) embedded in a vest or wearable band, corresponding to the spatial distribution of detected objects.
    *   **Intensity Mapping:**  Vibration intensity proportional to the distance to the detected object (closer = stronger vibration).
    *   **Directional Encoding:** Actuator activation pattern encodes the direction of the detected object relative to the user.  Actuator spacing: 2cm.
    *   **Texture Rendering:** Subtle variations in vibration frequency and amplitude to simulate surface texture (e.g., smooth wall, rough bush).
*   **Power:** Rechargeable Lithium-ion battery providing at least 8 hours of continuous operation.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth connectivity for data logging and parameter adjustment via a smartphone app.

**Pseudocode for Haptic Rendering:**

```
// Input: 3D Point Cloud (distance, azimuth, elevation) for each detected object
// Output: Activation pattern for each vibrotactile actuator

function renderHapticMap(pointCloud) {

  for each point in pointCloud {
    distance = point.distance
    azimuth = point.azimuth
    elevation = point.elevation

    // Calculate actuator index based on azimuth and elevation
    actuatorIndex = calculateActuatorIndex(azimuth, elevation)

    // Calculate vibration intensity based on distance
    intensity = map(distance, 0, maxRange, 1, 0)  // Normalize distance to intensity

    // Activate corresponding actuator with calculated intensity
    setActuatorIntensity(actuatorIndex, intensity)
  }
}

function calculateActuatorIndex(azimuth, elevation) {
  // Map azimuth and elevation to corresponding actuator index
  // Consider actuator spacing and arrangement
  // Example: actuatorIndex = floor(azimuth / actuatorSpacing) + floor(elevation / actuatorSpacing) * numActuatorsPerRow
  // Adjust mapping based on specific hardware setup
  return actuatorIndex
}

function setActuatorIntensity(actuatorIndex, intensity) {
  // Control the vibrotactile actuator at the specified index with the given intensity
  // Use PWM or other suitable control method
  // Adjust actuator control parameters for optimal tactile sensation
}
```

**Novelty:** Combines advanced ultrasonic beamforming with precisely controlled haptic feedback to render a dynamic, tactile representation of the environment. This goes beyond simple obstacle detection; it aims to create a form of 'spatial vision' for users who are visually impaired or for applications requiring enhanced situational awareness in complex environments (e.g., search and rescue, robotics).  The system's adaptability to different environments via adjustable parameters and learning algorithms is also a key advantage.
