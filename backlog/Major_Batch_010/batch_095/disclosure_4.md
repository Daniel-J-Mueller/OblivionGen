## Adaptive Predictive Buffering with Content-Aware Priority

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust output buffer sizes and packet eviction priorities based on predicted user engagement with specific content segments, utilizing real-time telemetry and machine learning.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on HRD buffer management tied to decoding duration. This expands on that by introducing a *predictive* element, factoring in user behavior and content characteristics to prioritize smooth playback of *engaging* content, even at the expense of buffering less-important segments.

**Components:**

1.  **Telemetry Module:** Captures user interaction data:
    *   Viewership duration of content segments (e.g., scenes, chapters).
    *   Pauses, rewinds, fast-forwards.
    *   Seek behavior (how far users jump within the content).
    *   Device type, network conditions.

2.  **Content Analysis Module:** Analyzes content features:
    *   Scene detection (using visual/audio cues).
    *   Motion vectors (to estimate visual complexity).
    *   Audio analysis (to identify emotionally resonant segments - music, dialogue).
    *   Metadata analysis (genre, keywords, tags).

3.  **Engagement Prediction Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network, Transformer) trained on historical telemetry and content analysis data. The model predicts a "engagement score" for each content segment â€“ a probability that the user will continue watching without interruption.

4.  **Adaptive Buffer Manager:**  Controls the output buffer with the following logic:

    *   **Base Buffer Size:** Determined by network latency and target bitrate (as in the existing patent).
    *   **Engagement-Weighted Buffer Allocation:**
        *   Content segments with *high* engagement scores receive a *larger* share of the buffer space (e.g., 75% of available space).
        *   Content segments with *low* engagement scores receive a *smaller* share (e.g., 25% or even zero).
    *   **Dynamic Prioritization:**  Packets associated with high-engagement segments are *prioritized* for eviction.  If buffer space is limited, packets from low-engagement segments are evicted *first*.
    *   **Predictive Pre-Buffering:** Based on the engagement prediction, the system *pre-buffers* segments predicted to have high engagement, even before they are needed.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Buffer Manager):**

```
// Input:  List of packets (packetList), Target buffer size (bufferSize),
//         Engagement scores for each packet's segment (engagementScores)

function manageBuffer(packetList, bufferSize, engagementScores) {
  // Calculate weights based on engagement scores (normalize to 0-1)
  weights = normalize(engagementScores);

  // Calculate allocated buffer size for each segment
  segmentBufferSizes = weights * bufferSize

  // Sort packets by segment engagement (descending)
  sortedPackets = sortPacketsByEngagement(packetList)

  currentBuffer = []

  for packet in sortedPackets {
    segment = packet.segment

    if (currentBuffer.size < bufferSize) {
      currentBuffer.add(packet)
    } else {
      //Eviction Logic: Prioritize low engagement segments
      evictedPacket = findLowestEngagementPacket(currentBuffer)

      if (packet.engagement > evictedPacket.engagement){
        currentBuffer.remove(evictedPacket)
        currentBuffer.add(packet)
      }
    }
  }

  return currentBuffer
}
```

**Output:** Prioritized and dynamically sized output buffer with content segments ordered by predicted user engagement.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Live Streaming: Improve viewer experience by prioritizing smooth playback of key moments (e.g., sports highlights, critical dialogue).
*   Video-on-Demand: Optimize buffer allocation for engaging content, reducing startup delays and buffering interruptions.
*   Interactive Video: Adapt buffer allocation based on user choices and interactions.
