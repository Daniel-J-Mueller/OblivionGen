## Adaptive Data Sharding with Predictive Pre-Fetch

**Concept:** Extend the object-based storage approach to dynamically shard data objects across multiple storage nodes *before* a transaction even begins, based on predicted access patterns. This significantly reduces lock contention and improves concurrency, especially for frequently accessed or modified objects.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Sharding Engine (PSE)
*   **Location:** Integrated into the Agent Server Process.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *Access History Database:* Stores transaction history, identifying frequently accessed object segments (chunks). Segment size configurable (e.g., 64KB, 1MB).
    *   *Shard Map:* Maps object segments to physical storage nodes. Dynamic and updated by PSE.
    *   *Prediction Model:* A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) trained on access history to predict future segment access.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Initial Phase (Transaction Arrival):**
        *   Agent Server receives a transaction.
        *   PSE queries Prediction Model for the transaction's target object.
        *   Prediction Model returns a ranked list of likely accessed segments.
    2.  **Pre-Shard Phase:**
        *   PSE creates temporary shards for the predicted segments on different storage nodes.
        *   PSE updates the Shard Map with the new shard locations.
        *   PSE acquires *local* locks on the shards (not a global object lock initially).
    3.  **Transaction Execution:**
        *   Transaction proceeds, accessing segments from their pre-allocated shards.
        *   If a segment isnâ€™t in the pre-shard list, a standard lock acquisition & read/write sequence is initiated.
        *   Upon completion, the shards are either merged back into the original object (if write operation) or left in place for future access.
    4.  **Shard Management:**
        *   A background process periodically analyzes access patterns and adjusts the prediction model.
        *   Unused shards are reclaimed and storage nodes are rebalanced.
*   **Pseudocode (Agent Server - Transaction Handling):**

```
function handleTransaction(transaction):
  object = transaction.targetObject
  
  predictedSegments = PSE.predictSegments(object)
  
  PSE.createShards(object, predictedSegments)
  
  localLocks = []
  for segment in predictedSegments:
    lock = acquireLocalLock(segment)
    localLocks.append(lock)

  try:
    // Execute transaction using segments from shards, protected by localLocks
    // If segment not in shard list, use standard lock/read/write
  finally:
    // Release localLocks
    releaseLocks(localLocks)

    // Merge shards or leave in place
    PSE.manageShards(object)
```

*   **Hardware Considerations:** Requires a distributed storage system with fast inter-node communication. NVMe storage preferred for shard access speed.
*   **Scalability:** The system is inherently scalable due to its distributed nature and localized lock acquisition.  The Prediction Model can be distributed as well.
* **Data Consistency:** Uses local locks initially, minimizing contention.  Shard merging and data replication ensure eventual consistency.
