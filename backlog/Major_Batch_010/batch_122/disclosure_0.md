## Dynamic Dataflow Visualization with Predictive Branching

**Concept:** Extend the tree/indentation visualization to not only represent *existing* data dependencies, but also *predict* potential dependencies based on code analysis and runtime data. This creates a “dynamic dataflow graph” that anticipates issues before they manifest.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Data Structures:**

*   **Trace Node:** (Existing) Represents a line of code with associated variables, values, and control flow information.
*   **Dependency Edge:** (Existing) Represents a data dependency between Trace Nodes (e.g., variable 'x' in Node A is used in Node B).
*   **Predictive Edge:** A *new* edge type representing a *potential* dependency. These edges are initially ‘weak’ and have an associated confidence score.
*   **Confidence Score:** A numerical value (0.0 - 1.0) representing the probability that a predictive dependency is *actual*.  Calculated using static code analysis, historical runtime data, and potentially machine learning models.
*   **Dynamic Graph Data Structure:** A graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) optimized for traversing and updating dependencies in real-time.  This is preferred over a simple tree structure to allow for more complex dependency relationships.

**II. Algorithm – Predictive Dependency Generation:**

1.  **Static Analysis Phase:**
    *   Analyze the source code for potential data dependencies *before* runtime.
    *   Identify variables with similar names or types in different scopes.
    *   Create Predictive Edges with initial Confidence Scores based on naming conventions, scope, and code complexity.
    *   Example: If a variable ‘temp_value’ is used in multiple functions, a Predictive Edge is created between those functions.
2.  **Runtime Monitoring Phase:**
    *   Monitor variable access and modification during program execution.
    *   For each variable access, check for existing Predictive Edges.
    *   If a Predictive Edge exists *and* the predicted dependency is observed at runtime (e.g., ‘temp_value’ from Function A is actually used in Function B), strengthen the edge (increase Confidence Score).
    *   If a Predictive Edge exists *but* the dependency is *not* observed, weaken the edge (decrease Confidence Score).  Edges below a certain threshold are removed.
    *   Identify new potential dependencies at runtime that were not predicted during static analysis. Create new Predictive Edges with initial low Confidence Scores.
3.  **Machine Learning Integration (Optional):**
    *   Train a machine learning model to predict data dependencies based on code features (e.g., variable names, code structure, control flow) and runtime data.
    *   Use the model to refine Confidence Scores and identify new potential dependencies.

**III. Visualization & User Interface:**

*   **Color Coding:**  Use different colors to represent the strength of Dependency and Predictive Edges.  Strong dependencies (high Confidence Score) are solid lines. Weak dependencies are dashed or dotted lines.
*   **Edge Weighting:**  Adjust edge thickness based on Confidence Score.
*   **Filtering:** Allow users to filter the graph based on Confidence Score, variable names, or function names.
*   **Interactive Exploration:**  Enable users to click on nodes and edges to view detailed information about variables, values, and dependencies.
*   **Alerting:**  Generate alerts when Predictive Edges with low Confidence Scores become critical (e.g., a predicted dependency is involved in an error).

**IV. Pseudocode – Predictive Edge Update**

```pseudocode
function updatePredictiveEdge(edge, dependencyObserved) {
  if (dependencyObserved) {
    edge.confidenceScore = edge.confidenceScore + 0.1 // Increase confidence
    edge.confidenceScore = min(edge.confidenceScore, 1.0) // Cap at 1.0
  } else {
    edge.confidenceScore = edge.confidenceScore - 0.05 // Decrease confidence
    if (edge.confidenceScore < 0.1) {
      removeEdge(edge) // Remove weak edge
    }
  }
}
```

**V. System Architecture**

*   **Code Analysis Service:** (Existing) Responsible for static code analysis.
*   **Runtime Monitoring Agent:**  Collects runtime data (variable access, modification).
*   **Dependency Graph Database:** Stores Dependency and Predictive Edges.
*   **Machine Learning Service (Optional):** Trains and deploys dependency prediction models.
*   **Visualization Service:** Renders the dynamic dataflow graph.
