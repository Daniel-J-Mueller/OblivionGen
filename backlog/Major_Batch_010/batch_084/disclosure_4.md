**Dynamic Resource ‘Shadowing’ for Predictive CDN Pre-Population**

**Concept:** Extend the existing system to not only *register* resources with a CDN but to proactively ‘shadow’ resource delivery – meaning, simultaneously serve resources from the network storage provider *and* the CDN – while building a predictive model for optimal CDN pre-population. This moves beyond simple registration to an active, learning system.

**Specs:**

*   **Component: ‘Shadow Dispatcher’:** This module intercepts all resource requests. For resources eligible for CDN delivery (determined by configuration – file type, content provider tier, etc.), the Shadow Dispatcher initiates *parallel* requests: one to the network storage, one to the CDN.
*   **Component: ‘Latency Observer’:**  Associated with the Latency Observer is a function which measures latency for both requests. It collects data points for:
    *   Total request time (from client perspective).
    *   Network storage response time.
    *   CDN response time.
    *   Geographic location of the request.
    *   Client device type.
*   **Component: ‘Predictive Pre-Populator’:** This is the core of the innovation.
    *   Input: Data from the Latency Observer.
    *   Algorithm: Utilizes a time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future resource requests based on historical data.
    *   Output:  A prioritized list of resources to pre-populate on the CDN, factoring in:
        *   Predicted request frequency.
        *   CDN latency vs. network storage latency (for that region).
        *   Resource size.
        *   Content provider priority.
*   **API Integration:**
    *   `POST /cdn/shadow/enable`: Enables shadow mode for a content provider or specific resources.  Requires content provider ID and resource list (optional).
    *   `GET /cdn/shadow/stats`: Returns aggregated shadow mode statistics (latency comparisons, pre-population effectiveness).
*   **Configuration:**
    *   `shadow_threshold`:  Latency difference (ms) at which the system favors CDN delivery (initially).
    *   `prepopulation_capacity`:  Maximum resources the Predictive Pre-Populator can request per cycle.
    *   `learning_rate`: Controls how quickly the system adapts to changing request patterns.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Pre-Populator):**

```
function predict_resource_demand(historical_data):
    // Use time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM)
    predicted_requests = model.predict(historical_data)
    return predicted_requests

function prioritize_resources(predicted_requests, resource_data):
    // Calculate a score for each resource based on predicted demand,
    // CDN latency vs. storage latency, resource size, and provider priority
    resource_scores = {}
    for resource in predicted_requests:
        score = (predicted_requests[resource] * weight_demand) + \
                (cdn_latency[resource] - storage_latency[resource]) * weight_latency + \
                (resource_size[resource] * weight_size) + \
                (content_provider_priority[resource] * weight_provider)
        resource_scores[resource] = score
    sorted_resources = sort_resources_by_score(resource_scores)
    return sorted_resources

function pre_populate_cdn(sorted_resources, capacity):
    pre_populated_count = 0
    for resource in sorted_resources:
        if pre_populated_count < capacity:
            // Request CDN to pre-populate resource
            cdn_api.pre_populate(resource)
            pre_populated_count += 1
        else:
            break
```

**Innovation:**  Shifting from reactive CDN registration to a proactive, learning system. The ‘shadowing’ allows real-time performance comparison, and the predictive model anticipates demand, ensuring optimal CDN utilization *before* requests arrive. This minimizes latency and maximizes the benefits of a CDN.
