## Dynamic Taxonomy Construction via User-Generated "Concept Tags"

**Concept:** Extend the existing search query segmentation by incorporating a user-driven taxonomy creation layer. Instead of *only* assigning queries to pre-defined nodes, allow users to *create* new taxonomy nodes via “concept tags” applied to search results. This dynamically evolves the taxonomy based on actual user behavior and intent, creating a more nuanced and responsive categorization.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** "Concept Tagging Module" - integrated into the search results display.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   After a user views a search result, they are presented with a set of suggested "concept tags" related to the item. These are dynamically generated based on item attributes, keywords, and potentially, the user’s profile.
    *   Users can also *create* their own concept tags if none of the suggestions are appropriate. Tag creation is subject to moderation to prevent abuse.
    *   Each concept tag is associated with the specific search result.
    *   A "Tag Strength" metric is calculated for each tag based on the number of users associating it with the item.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   A new database table "ConceptTags" stores tag names, descriptions (optional), creation timestamps, and creator IDs.
    *   A linking table “SearchResultTags” connects search results to concept tags, recording the number of users associating a tag with the result.
*   **Taxonomy Update Algorithm:**
    *   Periodically (e.g., daily), analyze the “SearchResultTags” data.
    *   If a concept tag reaches a certain "Tag Strength" threshold, it is automatically promoted to a new taxonomy node.
    *   The algorithm assesses semantic similarity between the new node and existing nodes to determine appropriate placement within the taxonomy. This avoids creating redundant categories.
*   **Search Integration:**
    *   The search query segmentation algorithm now incorporates concept tags as potential taxonomy nodes.
    *   If a search query segment matches a concept tag with sufficient "Tag Strength", the corresponding search results are prioritized.
    *   Users can *filter* search results by concept tag, further refining their search.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   A "Trending Tags" section displays popular concept tags, allowing users to explore emerging categories.
    *   Users can "subscribe" to concept tags, receiving notifications when new items are tagged with that concept.

**Pseudocode (Taxonomy Update):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION updateTaxonomy()
  FOR EACH conceptTag IN ConceptTags
    IF conceptTag.tagStrength > tagStrengthThreshold THEN
      // Calculate semantic similarity to existing taxonomy nodes
      similarityScores = calculateSemanticSimilarity(conceptTag.name, existingTaxonomyNodes)
      bestMatchNode = findNodeWithHighestSimilarity(similarityScores)

      IF bestMatchNode != NULL THEN
        // Insert conceptTag as a child node of bestMatchNode
        insertAsChildNode(bestMatchNode, conceptTag)
      ELSE
        // Create a new root node for conceptTag
        createRootNode(conceptTag)

      // Reset tagStrength for next update cycle
      conceptTag.tagStrength = 0
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateSemanticSimilarity(tagName, existingNodes)
  FOR EACH node IN existingNodes
    similarityScore = calculateCosineSimilarity(tagName, node.name) // Or other similarity metric
    ADD (node, similarityScore) TO similarityScores
  ENDFOR
  RETURN similarityScores
END FUNCTION
