## Dynamic Content "Heatmaps" & Predictive Pre-fetching

**Concept:** Extending the idea of identifying important content portions, create a dynamic heatmap overlaid on web content, visualized *within* the browser, representing predicted user attention based on real-time interaction data. Simultaneously, proactively pre-fetch likely-to-be-viewed content "tiles" surrounding the heatmap's focus.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Attention Prediction Engine (APE):**
    *   Input: Continuous stream of user interaction data (scrolling speed/direction, dwell time, zoom level, mouse movements, clicks, keyboard input – even subtle things like ‘rage clicking’ speed).
    *   Processing: Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to model user attention over time. The LSTM predicts the probability distribution of where the user will look/interact *next* within the content.
    *   Output: A normalized heatmap representing predicted attention.  Heatmap values range 0.0 (no attention) to 1.0 (highest predicted attention).  The heatmap should be resolution-agnostic (vector-based) for scaling.

*   **Component 2: Content Tiling & Prefetching Module (CTPM):**
    *   Input: The content page’s Document Object Model (DOM) & the heatmap from the APE.
    *   Processing:
        1.  Divide the page into a grid of rectangular “content tiles.”  Tile size dynamically adjusts based on page complexity/density, defaulting to 200x150 pixels.
        2.  Assign each tile a “prefetch priority” score. The score is calculated as: `Priority = HeatmapValue * ContentComplexity * Recency`.  `ContentComplexity` is an assessment of the visual/textual richness of the tile. `Recency` decreases over time – prioritizing content closer to the user’s current view.
        3.  Maintain a prefetch queue sorted by priority. The queue holds URLs for content tiles not currently loaded.
        4.  Continuously (but rate-limited) prefetch tiles from the queue in the background. Store prefetched content in a local cache (browser storage).
    *   Output: A locally cached set of content tiles.

*   **Component 3: Dynamic Overlay Renderer (DOR):**
    *   Input: DOM, heatmap, cached tiles.
    *   Processing:
        1.  Render the heatmap as a semi-transparent overlay on top of the content. Heatmap color scheme should be customizable by the user (e.g., cool colors for low attention, warm colors for high attention).
        2.  When a tile is about to come into view (based on scrolling), *seamlessly* swap the currently rendered content with the pre-fetched tile from the cache. This eliminates loading delays.
        3.  Optional: Apply subtle visual cues to the heatmap (e.g., pulsing highlights) to indicate areas of particularly high predicted attention.
    *   Output: A rendered webpage with a dynamic attention heatmap and seamless content loading.

**Pseudocode (DOR):**

```
function renderPage(dom, heatmap, cache):
  for each element in dom:
    renderElement(element)

  applyHeatmapOverlay(heatmap)

  onScroll:
    for each element in viewport:
      if element not in cache:
        prefetchElement(element)
        replaceElement(element, cachedElement)
```

**User Customization:**

*   Heatmap color scheme.
*   Heatmap opacity.
*   Prefetch aggressiveness (rate limiting).
*   Option to disable heatmap entirely.
*   Option to only prefetch specific content types (e.g., images, videos).
