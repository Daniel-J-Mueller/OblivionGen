## Adaptive Key Entropy Modulation

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the cryptographic key entropy *during* operation based on observed network conditions and request patterns. This isn't about rotating keys, but *modifying* their complexity.

**Specification:**

**1. Entropy Profile Database:**
    *   Stores entropy profiles for each key. Each profile defines a range of entropy levels (e.g., 128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit) and associated performance/security trade-offs.
    *   Profiles are keyed by a unique identifier for the cryptographic key.
    *   Includes metadata about the keyâ€™s intended usage (e.g., TLS handshake, data encryption, authentication).

**2. Network Condition Monitor:**
    *   Continuously monitors network latency, packet loss, bandwidth, and detected attack signatures.
    *   Calculates a 'Network Stress Score' (NSS) ranging from 0-100. Higher values indicate more stressful conditions.

**3. Request Pattern Analyzer:**
    *   Analyzes incoming requests for patterns indicating potential attacks (e.g., rate limiting violations, unusual request sizes, repeated failed attempts).
    *   Generates an 'Anomaly Score' (AS) ranging from 0-100. Higher values indicate greater anomaly.

**4. Entropy Adjustment Engine:**
    *   Combines NSS and AS to determine a target entropy level.
    *   The mapping between NSS/AS and entropy level is configurable via a policy engine.  (Example: NSS < 30 & AS < 20 -> 128-bit.  NSS > 70 OR AS > 80 -> 256-bit).
    *   Implements a *gradual* entropy adjustment mechanism.  Instead of abruptly switching to a new key, the system *modifies* the existing key over multiple operations using a key derivation function (KDF).  This minimizes disruption.

    ```pseudocode
    function adjustKeyEntropy(key, NSS, AS):
        policy = getEntropyPolicy(NSS, AS)
        targetEntropy = policy.entropyLevel

        currentEntropy = getKeyEntropy(key)

        if currentEntropy != targetEntropy:
            // Derive a new key segment
            newSegment = deriveKeySegment(key, targetEntropy, currentEntropy)

            // Combine the segment with the existing key
            newKey = combineKeySegments(key, newSegment)

            // Update the key store
            updateKeyStore(newKey)

            return newKey
        else:
            return key
    ```

**5. Key Derivation Function (KDF) Details:**
    *   Uses a robust KDF like HKDF with SHA-256 or higher.
    *   The KDF input includes:
        *   The existing key.
        *   A 'drift value' - a pseudorandom number that changes with each adjustment.  This prevents replay attacks and ensures key diversity.
        *   The target entropy level.

**6.  Implementation Notes:**

    *   This system is most effective when combined with a key caching mechanism.
    *   The entropy adjustment frequency should be configurable to balance security and performance.
    *   Careful monitoring and logging are crucial to detect and respond to any unexpected behavior.
