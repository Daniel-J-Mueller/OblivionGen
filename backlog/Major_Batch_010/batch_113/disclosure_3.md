## Adaptive Virtual Workspace Projection

**Concept:** Extend the remote session persistence idea to incorporate environmental awareness and projection. Instead of merely preserving a desktop *image*, actively project aspects of the virtual workspace into the user’s physical environment using augmented reality (AR) devices.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   AR Headset/Glasses: Capable of spatial mapping, object recognition, and overlaying digital content onto the user's view of the real world. Must support high-resolution display and low-latency tracking.
*   Depth Sensor: Integrated into the AR headset or a separate device to map the user’s physical environment.
*   Ambient Light Sensor: For adjusting virtual element brightness to match the real-world lighting conditions.
*   PES Server Infrastructure: Existing infrastructure to host virtual desktops and manage user sessions.
*   Optional: Haptic Feedback Devices (gloves, wristbands) for simulating interaction with virtual elements.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **PES AR Client:**  A software component running on the user’s AR device. It handles communication with the PES server, rendering of virtual elements, and spatial mapping.
*   **Virtual Workspace Manager (VWM):** A server-side component responsible for managing virtual workspaces, capturing workspace state, and transmitting data to the PES AR Client.
*   **AR Session Coordinator:** Manages the lifecycle of AR sessions, synchronizing virtual and physical elements, and handling user input.
*   **Workspace State Capture Module:**  Captures key aspects of the virtual workspace state: open applications, window positions, active content, and user input history.
*   **AR Rendering Engine:** Renders virtual elements (windows, applications, data visualizations) for display on the AR device.

**3. System Architecture:**

1.  **Initialization:** The user launches the PES AR Client on their AR device. The client establishes a connection with the PES server.
2.  **Workspace Creation/Loading:** The user selects or creates a virtual workspace. The VWM loads the workspace state (applications, data) from the PES server.
3.  **Spatial Mapping:** The AR device performs spatial mapping of the user’s environment, creating a 3D model of the room.
4.  **Workspace Projection:** The VWM determines optimal placement of virtual elements within the user's physical space, considering factors like screen size, viewing angle, and available surface area. The AR Rendering Engine renders the virtual elements and projects them onto the user’s view.
5.  **Interactive Session:** The user interacts with the virtual workspace using voice commands, hand gestures, or a virtual keyboard/mouse.  Input is transmitted to the PES server, processed, and results are displayed on the virtual elements.
6.  **Session Persistence:** As the user interacts with the workspace, the Workspace State Capture Module continuously captures changes to the workspace state. This data is stored on the PES server.
7.  **Session Disconnect/Reconnect:** When the user disconnects from the PES server, the current workspace state is saved. Upon reconnection, the virtual workspace is restored to its previous state, including the placement of virtual elements within the user’s physical environment.

**4. Pseudocode (AR Session Coordinator - Restore Workspace):**

```
FUNCTION RestoreWorkspace(userID, workspaceID):
  // Load workspace state from PES server
  workspaceState = LoadWorkspaceState(userID, workspaceID)

  // Get spatial map data from AR device
  spatialMap = GetSpatialMap()

  // Determine optimal placement of virtual elements based on spatial map
  virtualElementPositions = CalculateVirtualElementPositions(workspaceState, spatialMap)

  // Render virtual elements at calculated positions
  RenderVirtualElements(virtualElementPositions, workspaceState)

  // Attach local data store to the virtual workspace
  AttachLocalDataStore(workspaceState)

  //Synchronize data store with the remote session
  SynchronizeDataStore()
END FUNCTION
```

**5. Novel Aspects:**

*   **Dynamic Workspace Projection:** Actively projecting virtual workspace elements *into* the physical environment, rather than simply mirroring a desktop.
*   **Spatial Awareness:** Utilizing spatial mapping to dynamically adjust the layout of virtual elements based on the user’s physical surroundings.
*   **Seamless Persistence:** Restoring the *entire* workspace, including its layout within the physical environment, upon reconnection.
*   **Hybrid Interaction:** Combining traditional desktop interaction with AR-based gestures and voice commands.
