## Dynamic Content Remixing with Generative Fill

**Concept:** Extend semantic detection to dynamically remix digital content – not just *present* it – by identifying elements and replacing/augmenting them with generative AI fill, guided by the detected semantic relationships.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Modules:**

*   **Semantic Graph Builder:** (Existing from patent) – Identifies entities (image, text), anchor entities, and relationships.  Output:  Semantic graph representing content structure.
*   **Generative Fill Interface:** API to access a generative AI model (e.g., DALL-E, Stable Diffusion).  Accepts prompts and content regions as input, outputs modified content regions.
*   **Remix Policy Engine:** Defines rules for content modification. These rules are triggered by specific semantic graph patterns.  Rules specify:
    *   Target Entity Type: (e.g., “background images”, “product depictions”)
    *   Modification Type: (e.g., “style transfer”, “object replacement”, “scene expansion”)
    *   Prompt Construction Logic:  Rules for generating prompts for the Generative Fill Interface, incorporating semantic information.
    *   Confidence Threshold: Minimum confidence level for semantic detection required to trigger the remix.
*   **Content Stitcher:**  Module to seamlessly integrate the modified content regions back into the original digital content.  Handles resizing, color correction, and blending.
*   **A/B Testing & Feedback Loop:** System to track user engagement with remixed content and refine Remix Policies.

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Content Ingestion:** Digital content received.
2.  **Semantic Analysis:** Semantic Graph Builder generates a semantic graph.
3.  **Policy Evaluation:** Remix Policy Engine evaluates the semantic graph against defined rules.
4.  **Remix Triggered?:** If a rule matches and confidence thresholds are met:
    *   Identify Target Region: Select the content region corresponding to the target entity.
    *   Prompt Generation: Construct a prompt for the Generative Fill Interface, incorporating semantic information (e.g., "replace the sky with a dramatic sunset", "render the product in a futuristic style").
    *   Generative Fill Request: Send the prompt and target region to the Generative Fill Interface.
    *   Receive Modified Region: Receive the modified content region from the Generative Fill Interface.
5.  **Content Stitching:** Content Stitcher seamlessly integrates the modified region into the original content.
6.  **Output:** Remixed digital content delivered.

**3.  Pseudocode (Remix Policy Evaluation):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION EvaluatePolicy(semanticGraph, policyRule)
  IF semanticGraph.hasEntity(policyRule.targetEntityType) THEN
    entity = semanticGraph.getEntity(policyRule.targetEntityType)
    IF entity.confidence > policyRule.confidenceThreshold THEN
      prompt = ConstructPrompt(entity, policyRule)  // Logic to create prompt based on entity attributes and rule
      RETURN prompt // Signal to initiate Generative Fill
    ENDIF
  ENDIF
  RETURN NULL // No remix triggered
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION ConstructPrompt(entity, policyRule)
  prompt = policyRule.basePrompt // Start with a base prompt
  prompt += " in the style of " + entity.style // Add any style info
  prompt += " with " + entity.attributes // Add other attributes
  RETURN prompt
ENDFUNCTION
```

**4.  Data Storage:**

*   Remix Policies: Stored as structured data (e.g., JSON) with rules, prompts, and confidence thresholds.
*   User Engagement Data: Stored for A/B testing and policy refinement.
*   Generative Fill Logs: Track requests and responses for monitoring and optimization.

**5.  Example Remix Policy:**

```json
{
  "ruleName": "Dramatic Sky Replacement",
  "targetEntityType": "background_image",
  "confidenceThreshold": 0.8,
  "basePrompt": "replace the sky with a dramatic",
  "styleOptions": ["sunset", "stormy clouds", "aurora borealis"]
}
```

This policy would trigger when a background image is detected with high confidence, replacing it with a dramatic sky scene chosen from the style options.
