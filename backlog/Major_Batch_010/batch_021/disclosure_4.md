## Dynamic Scene Graph Injection for Synthetic Data Generation

**Concept:** Expand the synthetic data generation beyond simple foreground/background compositing by building a dynamic scene graph representation *within* the synthetic image generation process. This allows for more complex relationships between objects, and realistic occlusion/interaction.

**Specs:**

**1. Scene Graph Construction Module:**

*   **Input:** Initial object definition (from the existing patent’s foreground data).  Object class label (e.g., “human”, “car”).
*   **Process:**
    *   Randomly generate a limited set of *relationships* between the initial object and potential other objects.  Relationships include: “supports”, “occludes”, “adjacent_to”, “interacting_with”.  The number and types of relationships are configurable.
    *   For each relationship, instantiate a related object (randomly chosen from a pre-defined object library).  Object size and position are initialized randomly, constrained by the specified relationship.  For example: “supports” necessitates an object *below* the initial object.
    *   Construct a scene graph data structure representing the objects and their relationships. This graph is a key/value store. Key = Object ID. Value = List of relationships, properties (size, orientation).
*   **Output:** Scene graph representation of the initial object and its dynamically generated relationships.

**2. Graph-Aware Rendering Module:**

*   **Input:** Scene graph, initial background image, and rendering parameters (lighting, camera angle, resolution).
*   **Process:**
    *   Perform a depth-first traversal of the scene graph.
    *   For each node (object) in the graph:
        *   Calculate object position and orientation based on its relationships to other objects *already rendered*. This ensures correct occlusion and interaction.  Occlusion is handled by depth buffering during rendering.
        *   Apply rendering effects (shadows, reflections) based on the scene graph relationships and lighting conditions.
        *   Render the object onto a canvas.
*   **Output:** Composite image with dynamically generated objects and realistic interactions.

**3.  Feedback Loop with Object Detector:**

*   **Process:**
    *   The composite image is sent to the object detector.
    *   The object detector's confidence scores and bounding box predictions are used to *weight* the probabilities of certain relationship types in the Scene Graph Construction Module.  For example: if the detector consistently fails to identify an object *behind* another, the probability of generating “occludes” relationships in that scenario is reduced.
    *   The confidence scores also contribute to weighting parameters in the rendering engine.

**Pseudocode (Scene Graph Construction Module):**

```python
def construct_scene_graph(initial_object, object_library, relationship_probabilities):
    scene_graph = {initial_object["id"]: {"relationships": []}}
    num_related_objects = random.randint(0, 5) #Configurable
    for _ in range(num_related_objects):
        relationship_type = random.choices(list(relationship_probabilities.keys()), weights=list(relationship_probabilities.values()))[0]
        related_object = random.choice(object_library)
        #Constraint logic based on relationship_type
        if relationship_type == "supports":
            #Position related_object below initial_object
        elif relationship_type == "occludes":
            #Position related_object in front of initial_object
        scene_graph[related_object["id"]] = {"relationships": [("supports", initial_object["id"])]} #example
    return scene_graph
```

**Novelty:**  This differs from the source patent by introducing a *structured* representation of the scene (the graph) that guides the generation of more complex and realistic images, not just simple foreground-background blending.  The feedback loop with the object detector enhances the realism and trainability of the synthetic data. The modular nature allows for easy expansion of the object library and relationship types.
