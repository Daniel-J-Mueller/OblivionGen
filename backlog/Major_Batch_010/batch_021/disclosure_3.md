## Dynamic Diagram Complexity Scoring & Automated Refactoring

**Concept:** Extend the automated diagram analysis to incorporate a "complexity score" based on graph theory metrics *and* predicted cognitive load.  Then, automatically trigger refactoring suggestions based on exceeding complexity thresholds, proactively simplifying diagrams before ambiguities even arise.

**Specifications:**

**1. Complexity Metric Engine:**

*   **Input:** Software design diagram represented as a graph (nodes = components, edges = relationships). Spatial coordinates of nodes and edges are *required*.
*   **Metrics Calculated:**
    *   *Cyclomatic Complexity:* Standard measure of control flow complexity within the graph.
    *   *Node Degree Variance:*  Standard deviation of the number of edges connected to each node. High variance indicates uneven distribution of connections.
    *   *Edge Density:* Ratio of actual edges to the maximum possible edges.  Indicates overall connectedness.
    *   *Spatial Proximity Penalty:* A penalty added to the complexity score based on overlapping or very close edges and nodes.  Calculated using a spatial hashing algorithm to identify collisions.
    *   *Predicted Cognitive Load (PCL):*  A novel metric estimated using a machine learning model trained on eye-tracking data of engineers reviewing diagrams. Inputs: Cyclomatic complexity, Node Degree Variance, Edge Density, and Spatial Proximity Penalty. Output: PCL score (0-100).
*   **Output:**  A single "Diagram Complexity Score" (DCS) incorporating all metrics, with weighted components.  The DCS is normalized to a scale of 0-100.

**2. Automated Refactoring Module:**

*   **Input:**  DCS, diagram graph, spatial coordinates.
*   **Thresholds:**  Configurable thresholds for DCS levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
*   **Refactoring Actions:** Based on DCS level and contributing factors, suggest or automatically perform:
    *   *Component Decomposition:* Split complex components (nodes) into smaller, more manageable sub-components.
    *   *Relationship Abstraction:*  Group similar relationships (edges) into higher-level abstractions.
    *   *Layout Optimization:*  Adjust node and edge positions to minimize edge crossings and improve visual clarity. Employ a force-directed graph drawing algorithm.
    *   *Connector Style Changes:* Change connector styles (e.g., orthogonal vs. curved) to reduce visual clutter.
    *   *Automatic Grouping:* Use graph clustering algorithms (e.g., Louvain method) to identify and group related components.
*   **Output:** Modified diagram graph with suggested or applied refactoring actions.  Display a "Refactoring Report" detailing the changes made and their impact on the DCS.



**Pseudocode (Refactoring Action Selection):**

```
function selectRefactoringActions(diagramGraph, DCS, thresholds):
  actions = []

  if DCS > thresholds["Critical"]:
    actions.append(decomposeComplexComponents(diagramGraph))
    actions.append(abstractRelationships(diagramGraph))
    actions.append(optimizeLayout(diagramGraph))
  else if DCS > thresholds["High"]:
    actions.append(optimizeLayout(diagramGraph))
    actions.append(simplifyRelationships(diagramGraph))
  else if DCS > thresholds["Medium"]:
    actions.append(improveConnectorStyles(diagramGraph))

  return actions
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `DiagramGraph`:  Adjacency list or matrix representing the diagram's components and relationships. Each node contains spatial coordinate data.
*   `RefactoringReport`:  JSON format detailing changes made, impact on DCS, and any warnings or recommendations.

**Future Considerations:**

*   Integrate with version control systems to track refactoring history.
*   Allow users to customize refactoring rules and thresholds.
*   Develop a predictive model to estimate the impact of changes before they are applied.
*   Support multiple diagram types (e.g., UML, SysML, BPMN).
