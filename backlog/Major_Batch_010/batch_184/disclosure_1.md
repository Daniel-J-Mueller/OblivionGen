## Virtual Path Predictive Congestion Management

**Concept:** Extend the virtual path monitoring described in the patent to *predict* congestion before it impacts traffic, and proactively adjust virtual path allocation and traffic shaping. This moves beyond reactive monitoring to predictive management, optimizing network performance and resilience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Predictive Congestion Module (PCM):** Dedicated hardware within each edge router. Implements time-series analysis and machine learning algorithms. Requires dedicated memory (e.g., SRAM) for model storage and real-time data processing.
*   **Virtual Path Allocation Table (VPAT):** Extends existing forwarding tables. Stores not only current virtual path assignments but also available capacity and predicted congestion levels for each path.
*   **Traffic Shaping Engine (TSE):** Hardware-based engine capable of dynamically adjusting packet rates and priorities on each virtual path. This engine must operate at line rate.
*   **Telemetry Stream Processor (TSP):** High-speed data processor for collecting, aggregating, and transmitting telemetry data (virtual path usage, latency, jitter) to a central network management system.

**2. Software/Algorithms:**

*   **Congestion Prediction Model:** Time-series forecasting algorithm (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM neural network). Trained on historical telemetry data to predict future virtual path congestion.  Model parameters updated continuously.
*   **Dynamic Virtual Path Allocation (DVPA):** Algorithm that monitors predicted congestion levels and dynamically adjusts virtual path assignments.  If a path is predicted to become congested, DVPA automatically reroutes traffic to a less congested path. Prioritizes paths with available capacity.
*   **Traffic Shaping Policy Engine:** Determines appropriate traffic shaping parameters (e.g., packet rate, priority) based on current and predicted congestion levels.  Applies shaping parameters using the TSE.
*   **Anomaly Detection Module:** Identifies unusual traffic patterns that may indicate malicious activity or network issues.  Triggers alerts to network administrators.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Telemetry Collection:** TSP continuously collects telemetry data from all virtual paths.
2.  **Congestion Prediction:** PCM uses the collected telemetry data to train and run the congestion prediction model.
3.  **DVPA Monitoring:**  DVPA constantly monitors predicted congestion levels for each virtual path.
4.  **Proactive Adjustment:** If DVPA predicts congestion on a path, it reroutes traffic to alternative paths with available capacity.
5.  **Traffic Shaping:**  Traffic Shaping Policy Engine adjusts packet rates and priorities on each path to optimize performance and prevent congestion.
6.  **Anomaly Detection:** Anomaly Detection Module continuously monitors traffic patterns for unusual activity.
7.  **Telemetry Reporting:** TSP transmits telemetry data to a central network management system for analysis and reporting.

**4. Pseudocode (DVPA core logic):**

```
// Parameters:
// current_path: currently assigned virtual path
// predicted_congestion(path): function returning predicted congestion level for a path
// available_capacity(path): function returning available capacity for a path
// threshold_congestion: congestion level above which rerouting is considered
// path_list: list of available virtual paths

function find_alternative_path(current_path, path_list) {
    best_path = null
    lowest_congestion = infinity

    for each path in path_list {
        if path != current_path {
            congestion = predicted_congestion(path)
            capacity = available_capacity(path)

            if congestion < lowest_congestion and capacity > 0 {
                lowest_congestion = congestion
                best_path = path
            }
        }
    }

    if best_path != null and predicted_congestion(best_path) < threshold_congestion {
        return best_path
    } else {
        return current_path // stay on current path
    }
}

// In main loop:
new_path = find_alternative_path(current_path, path_list)
if new_path != current_path {
    // Update forwarding tables to reroute traffic to new_path
}
```

**5. Advanced Considerations:**

*   **Hierarchical Congestion Prediction:** Implement multiple layers of prediction, from short-term (milliseconds) to long-term (hours), to optimize response time and resource allocation.
*   **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to identify subtle anomalies that may indicate security threats or network malfunctions.
*   **Self-Learning System:**  Enable the system to learn from past events and continuously improve its prediction accuracy and resource allocation strategies.
*   **Integration with Network Orchestration Systems:** Integrate with existing network orchestration systems to automate the provisioning and management of virtual paths.
