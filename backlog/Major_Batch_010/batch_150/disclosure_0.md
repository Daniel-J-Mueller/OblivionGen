## Modular, Bio-Integrated Adapter System

**Concept:** An adapter system that moves beyond simple physical connection and incorporates biofeedback/biometric data acquisition and localized energy harvesting to dynamically optimize device function *and* user experience.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Base Adapter Module:** Physical interface (USB-C, Lightning, etc.) – common across all variants. Contains basic power delivery and data transfer circuitry.  Substrate material: Flexible PCB with biocompatible coating (e.g., Parylene C). Dimensions: 20mm x 10mm x 2mm.
2.  **Sensor Array Modules (interchangeable):** These snap onto the Base Adapter.
    *   **Skin Conductance Module:** Measures galvanic skin response (GSR).  Array of micro-sensors embedded in a flexible, conforming material. Data output: GSR value (microSiemens).
    *   **Temperature Module:** Measures skin temperature. Thermistor array. Data output: Temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit).
    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Module:**  Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor array for measuring pulse rate and HRV. Data output: BPM, HRV metrics (RMSSD, SDNN).
    *   **EMG Module:** Surface electromyography sensor for detecting muscle activity. Data output: EMG signal amplitude (microvolts).
3.  **Energy Harvesting Module (optional, snaps onto Base Adapter):**
    *   **Thermoelectric Generator (TEG):** Captures heat differential between device and user’s skin to generate electricity. Output: 3.3V DC (supplemental power).
    *   **Piezoelectric Harvester:** Converts mechanical strain (e.g., from movement) into electricity. Output: 3.3V DC (supplemental power).
4.  **Microcontroller & Wireless Communication Module:** Integrated within the Base Adapter.
    *   **Microcontroller:** ARM Cortex-M4 processor.
    *   **Wireless:** Bluetooth 5.2 Low Energy (BLE).
5.  **Software/API:**
    *   SDK for developers to access sensor data and control device function based on biofeedback.
    *   Mobile app for visualizing data and customizing adapter behavior.

**Operational Pseudocode (Device Control Example – Music Player):**

```
// Initialize Modules (Base Adapter, Sensor Array, Communication)

loop:
    read GSR from Sensor Array
    if GSR > threshold_high:
        decrease music volume by 10%
    else if GSR < threshold_low:
        increase music volume by 10%
    else:
        maintain current volume

    read HRV from Sensor Array
    if HRV < stress_threshold:
        play calming ambient track
    else:
        play user-selected track

    transmit sensor data via BLE to mobile app
    wait 50ms
```
