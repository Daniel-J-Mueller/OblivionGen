## Dynamic Environmental "Mood" Control via Sensory Integration

**Concept:** Extend the environment-aware control system to integrate and respond to broader sensory data (light, sound, temperature, even subtle atmospheric pressure changes) to create and maintain a desired "mood" within a space, automatically adjusting devices beyond just audio/visual meeting controls. This goes beyond simple automation and aims for proactive environmental shaping.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensory Input Module:**
    *   Multi-sensor array (ambient light, sound level/spectrum, temperature, humidity, barometric pressure). Wireless communication (Bluetooth/Zigbee/Wi-Fi).
    *   Real-time data streaming to central processing unit.
    *   Sensor calibration & self-diagnostics.
*   **Mood Profile Database:**
    *   Predefined mood profiles (e.g., “Focus,” “Relax,” “Energize,” “Creative”). Each profile defines target ranges for sensory inputs and corresponding device settings.
    *   User-customizable mood profiles. Allows creation of new profiles, modification of existing profiles, and naming conventions.
    *   Cloud synchronization of mood profiles across devices/locations.
*   **AI-Powered Mood Inference Engine:**
    *   Machine learning algorithm to infer user mood based on voice analysis (via microphone array) and facial expression recognition (via camera).
    *   Adaptive learning: The system learns user preferences over time and adjusts mood profiles accordingly.
*   **Device Control Interface:**
    *   Control over a wide range of devices: smart lighting (color temperature, brightness), HVAC systems, smart blinds/curtains, audio systems (music selection, volume), aromatherapy diffusers.
    *   API for integration with third-party smart home platforms.
*   **User Interface (Mobile App/Web Dashboard):**
    *   Visual representation of current sensory conditions.
    *   Selection of predefined or custom mood profiles.
    *   Manual override of device settings.
    *   Mood “timeline” showing historical sensory data and profile usage.
*   **Pseudocode - Mood Adjustment Loop**

```pseudocode
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Read sensory data
    sensoryData = readSensoryData();

    // Infer user mood (optional)
    userMood = inferUserMood(sensoryData);

    // Select mood profile (based on user selection or inference)
    moodProfile = selectMoodProfile(userMood);

    // Calculate device adjustments
    deviceAdjustments = calculateDeviceAdjustments(sensoryData, moodProfile);

    // Apply device adjustments
    applyDeviceAdjustments(deviceAdjustments);

    // Wait for a short interval
    wait(100ms);
}

// Function: calculateDeviceAdjustments
function calculateDeviceAdjustments(sensoryData, moodProfile) {
  adjustments = {};
  // Light
  if (sensoryData.lightLevel < moodProfile.targetLightLevel) {
    adjustments.light = "increase brightness";
  }

  //Temperature
  if (sensoryData.temperature < moodProfile.targetTemperature) {
    adjustments.temperature = "increase";
  }

  // Sound
  if (moodProfile.music == "On"){
    adjustments.music = "Play list " + moodProfile.musicList;
  }
  return adjustments;
}
```

**Novelty:**  While the provided patent focuses on video meeting control, this concept expands the scope to encompass broader environmental control for mood enhancement, utilizing a wider range of sensory data and AI-powered inference to proactively shape the environment. The integration of atmospheric pressure and the focus on *proactive* rather than reactive control differentiates it.
