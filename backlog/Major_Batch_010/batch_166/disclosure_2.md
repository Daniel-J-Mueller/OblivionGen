## Secure Data Beacon – Automated Data Exfiltration & Destruction

**Concept:** A portable storage device that proactively, and autonomously, exfiltrates data to a pre-defined, secure location *before* initiating self-destruction, triggered by a combination of environmental factors and time constraints. It's a 'dead man's switch' for data, but with a proactive data transfer component.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Components:** Volatile Memory (as per existing patent), Non-Volatile Memory (firmware, configuration), Capacitor (power reserve), Processor, Wireless Communication Module (Bluetooth Low Energy/Wi-Fi Direct), Accelerometer, Temperature Sensor, Tamper Detection Circuit (pressure/physical intrusion), Real-Time Clock.

*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Active Monitoring:** Device is connected to a host (computer, etc.). Data is written to volatile memory normally. Capacitor charges.
    *   **Autonomous Mode:** Device is disconnected.  Processor monitors accelerometer, temperature sensor, tamper detection, and RTC.
    *   **Exfiltration Phase:** If Autonomous Mode is triggered (disconnect + pre-defined conditions met - see below), the device enters the Exfiltration Phase.
    *   **Destruction Phase:**  Following *successful* data exfiltration (or failure after a limited number of retries), the volatile memory is erased.

*   **Trigger Conditions (Combinatorial):**
    *   **Time-Based:**  If disconnected for > X minutes/hours (user configurable).
    *   **Environmental:**
        *   Accelerometer detects significant/sustained movement (potential theft/tampering).
        *   Temperature exceeds/falls below thresholds (indicating hostile environment or attempted manipulation).
        *   Tamper detection circuit triggered (physical intrusion).
    *   **Signal Loss:** Prolonged loss of communication with a paired device (pre-defined ‘heartbeat’ signal).

*   **Exfiltration Protocol:**
    *   Data is encrypted using AES-256 or equivalent.
    *   Utilizes a secure, pre-defined wireless network (user configured) or peer-to-peer connection.
    *   Data is segmented and transmitted in multiple packets.
    *   Checksum verification ensures data integrity.
    *   Automatic retry mechanism for failed packets.
    *   Exfiltration occurs *before* capacitor discharge reaches critical levels.

*   **Power Management:**
    *   Capacitor prioritized for exfiltration process.
    *   Minimize processor activity during autonomous mode to conserve power.
    *   Dynamic power scaling based on activity level.

*   **Configuration:**
    *   User interface (small OLED screen + buttons) for setting:
        *   Exfiltration destination (SSID/MAC address).
        *   Trigger conditions (time limits, temperature thresholds, accelerometer sensitivity).
        *   Encryption key.
        *   Data retention policy.

**Pseudocode (Exfiltration Phase):**

```
function exfiltration_phase():
  if (connection_lost() and (time_elapsed() > user_defined_time or temperature_threshold_exceeded() or accelerometer_triggered())):
    establish_secure_wireless_connection()
    if connection_successful():
      segment_data()
      for each segment in data_segments:
        encrypt_segment(user_key)
        transmit_segment()
        verify_checksum()
        if checksum_failed():
          retry_transmission(max_retries)
          if retries_exhausted():
            log_error("Transmission Failed")
            break
      if all_segments_transmitted():
        log_success("Data Exfiltrated")
        initiate_data_destruction()
    else:
      log_error("Connection Failed")
      initiate_data_destruction() # Attempt even if connection fails
```

**Novelty:**  The proactive data exfiltration *before* self-destruction, combined with the combinatorial triggering based on multiple sensor inputs, provides a significantly enhanced level of data security compared to existing self-erasing storage devices. This is more than just a 'dead man's switch'; it's a system designed to *actively* protect data, not just destroy it after the fact.
