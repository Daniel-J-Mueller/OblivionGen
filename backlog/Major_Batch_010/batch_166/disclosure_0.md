## Dynamic Content Complexity Scaling

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on bit rate allocation based on quality *criteria*. This expands on that by dynamically adjusting the *complexity* of the encoded content itself, not just the bit rate, based on network conditions *and* predicted viewer engagement. It’s a move from simply delivering a requested quality to proactively *shaping* the content to ensure a smooth experience *and* minimizing bandwidth usage.

**Specs:**

**1. Engagement Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time viewership data (number of viewers, pause/rewind frequency, segment skipping, device type, location), content metadata (genre, actors, scenes, action density).
*   **Process:** Machine learning model trained to predict viewer engagement for each segment of content. Outputs an "Engagement Score" (0-100) for each segment.  Higher scores indicate more engaging content.
*   **Output:** Engagement Score per content segment.

**2. Complexity Control Module:**

*   **Input:** Engagement Score, current network bandwidth, predicted bandwidth (based on historical data and network monitoring), content type.
*   **Process:** Dynamically adjusts encoding parameters *beyond* bit rate. Parameters include:
    *   **Frame Rate:** Reduce frame rate during low engagement/bandwidth segments.
    *   **Resolution:** Scale down resolution during low engagement/bandwidth segments.
    *   **Scene Detail:** Employ simplified rendering/modeling for less critical visual elements during low engagement/bandwidth segments.  (e.g., reduce polygon count on background objects). This is done *pre-encoding* if possible – utilizing multiple versions of assets.
    *   **Color Depth:** Reduce color depth for less visually important segments.
    *   **Audio Channels:**  Reduce audio channel count (e.g., stereo to mono) during low engagement/bandwidth segments.
*   **Output:** Encoding parameters for each content segment.  These are passed to the encoder.

**3. Encoder Adaptation:**

*   **Input:** Content segment, encoding parameters.
*   **Process:** Standard video encoder (H.265, AV1, etc.) modified to accept per-segment encoding parameters.
*   **Output:** Encoded video stream.

**4. Statmux Integration:**

*   **Input:** Multiple encoded video streams, available bandwidth.
*   **Process:** Statmux adjusts channel allocation based on the dynamically adjusted complexity of each stream. Prioritizes streams with higher engagement scores and sufficient bandwidth.
*   **Output:** Stream output to viewing devices.

**Pseudocode (Complexity Control Module):**

```
function adjustComplexity(engagementScore, currentBandwidth, predictedBandwidth, contentType):
  complexityParams = {
    frameRate: defaultFrameRate,
    resolution: defaultResolution,
    sceneDetail: defaultSceneDetail,
    colorDepth: defaultColorDepth,
    audioChannels: defaultAudioChannels
  }

  if (currentBandwidth < predictedBandwidth * 0.5):
    # Bandwidth is low, reduce complexity aggressively
    complexityParams.frameRate = max(15, defaultFrameRate * 0.5)
    complexityParams.resolution = defaultResolution * 0.5
    complexityParams.sceneDetail = defaultSceneDetail * 0.5
    complexityParams.colorDepth = defaultColorDepth * 0.75
    complexityParams.audioChannels = 2 #Stereo

  elif (engagementScore < 30):
    #Low Engagement, reduce complexity slightly
    complexityParams.frameRate = defaultFrameRate * 0.8
    complexityParams.resolution = defaultResolution * 0.8
    complexityParams.sceneDetail = defaultSceneDetail * 0.9
    complexityParams.colorDepth = defaultColorDepth * 0.95

  return complexityParams
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simply allocating bandwidth. It *shapes* the content itself to match both network conditions *and* viewer engagement.  This has the potential to significantly reduce bandwidth usage without sacrificing perceived quality, especially for content where high visual fidelity isn’t critical. The dynamic adjustment allows for a more fluid viewing experience.
