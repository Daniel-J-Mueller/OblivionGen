## Adaptive Multi-Modal Handoff System

**Concept:** Extend the hybrid architecture to dynamically adjust communication modalities (audio, video, text, AR overlays) *during* a call based on network conditions, user device capabilities, and provider preferences, and seamlessly handoff between modalities.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A “Modality Manager” integrated into the Call Routing Service.
*   **Input Parameters:**
    *   Real-time network bandwidth estimates (user & provider).
    *   User device CPU/GPU load & screen resolution.
    *   Provider-defined modality preferences (e.g., “video essential”, “audio sufficient”, “AR overlays preferred”).
    *   Call type (e.g., remote diagnosis, urgent care, routine checkup).
*   **Modality Profiles:** Predefined profiles representing combinations of modalities (e.g., "High-Bandwidth": Video + AR; "Medium-Bandwidth": Audio + Text; "Low-Bandwidth": Audio only).
*   **Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm:**
    1.  Initial Modality Profile Selection: Based on initial network assessment and provider preference.
    2.  Continuous Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of network conditions and device load.
    3.  Adaptive Switching: If network bandwidth drops, or device load increases beyond a threshold, automatically switch to a lower-bandwidth modality profile.
    4.  Priority-Based Fallback: If multiple modalities are impacted, prioritize based on call type and provider preferences. (e.g., for a visual skin examination, video is prioritized, even if it means reducing AR overlay quality).
*   **AR Integration:**  Utilize the P2P connection for lightweight AR overlay transmission. (e.g., display medical imagery overlaid onto the user’s live video feed).  AR content is generated on the provider side and streamed as a separate, low-bandwidth stream over the P2P connection.
*   **Text/Chat Integration:** Integrated text channel for supplemental communication, particularly useful when bandwidth is severely limited.

**Pseudocode (Modality Manager):**

```
function selectInitialModality(userBandwidth, providerPreference, callType)
    if providerPreference == "videoEssential" and userBandwidth > MIN_VIDEO_BANDWIDTH
        return "HighBandwidth"
    else if userBandwidth > MIN_AUDIO_BANDWIDTH
        return "MediumBandwidth"
    else
        return "LowBandwidth"
end function

function adjustModality(currentModality, userBandwidth, deviceLoad, providerPreference)
    if deviceLoad > MAX_DEVICE_LOAD or userBandwidth < MIN_AUDIO_BANDWIDTH
        if currentModality == "HighBandwidth"
            currentModality = "MediumBandwidth"  //Switch to Audio + Text
        else if currentModality == "MediumBandwidth"
            currentModality = "LowBandwidth" //Switch to Audio only
        end if
    else if userBandwidth > MAX_VIDEO_BANDWIDTH and providerPreference == "videoEssential"
        currentModality = "HighBandwidth" //Restore High bandwidth if available
    end if
    return currentModality
end function

//Within Call Routing Service:

onCallInitiated():
    initialModality = selectInitialModality(userBandwidth, providerPreference, callType)
    setModalityProfile(userDevice, initialModality)
    setModalityProfile(providerDevice, initialModality)

onNetworkConditionChange():
    currentModality = adjustModality(currentModality, userBandwidth, deviceLoad, providerPreference)
    setModalityProfile(userDevice, currentModality)
    setModalityProfile(providerDevice, currentModality)
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Sufficient processing power on both user and provider devices for AR rendering (if applicable).
*   Stable network connection with bandwidth monitoring capabilities.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved call quality and reliability in challenging network conditions.
*   Enhanced user experience through adaptive communication modalities.
*   Support for advanced telemedicine applications (e.g., AR-assisted remote diagnosis).
