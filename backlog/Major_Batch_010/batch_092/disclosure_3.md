## Dynamic Persona-Driven Item Clustering

**Concept:** Extend the existing item clustering by introducing dynamic user personas derived from real-time behavioral data. Instead of solely relying on historical search data for cluster generation, the system will actively build and refine user personas *during* a browsing session and utilize these to personalize item recommendations.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Generation Module:**

   *   **Data Inputs:** Real-time user activity: clicks, dwell time on items, items added to cart, search queries *within the current session*, demographic data (if available), purchase history.
   *   **Persona Attributes:**  Each persona will have a set of weighted attributes representing interests, needs, and preferences. Examples: "Budget-conscious," "Luxury Seeker," "Tech Enthusiast," "Home Decorator," "Outdoor Adventurer." Weights will dynamically adjust based on real-time activity.
   *   **Algorithm:** Utilize a Bayesian network or Hidden Markov Model to infer persona attributes.  The network will learn relationships between user actions and persona traits.
   *   **Output:** A dynamic persona profile representing the user's current state.  This profile will be updated continuously throughout the session.

**2.  Persona-Aligned Cluster Selection:**

   *   **Input:** Dynamic persona profile, existing item clusters (generated as in the original patent).
   *   **Process:** A similarity score will be calculated between the persona profile and each existing item cluster.  The score will be based on the overlap between persona attributes and the item descriptors within the cluster.
   *   **Selection:** The system will select a subset of item clusters with the highest similarity scores. These clusters will be prioritized for item recommendation.

**3.  Real-Time Cluster Adaptation:**

   *   **Input:** User interactions (clicks, purchases, etc.), dynamic persona profile.
   *   **Process:**  Based on user interactions, the system will adapt the existing item clusters.
        *   **Expansion:**  If a user consistently interacts with items outside a primary cluster, items from related clusters will be added.
        *   **Contraction:**  If a user consistently ignores items within a cluster, those items will be removed or downweighted.
   *   **Algorithm:** Utilize reinforcement learning to optimize cluster adaptation based on user feedback.

**4.  Recommendation Engine:**

   *   **Input:** Adapted item clusters, dynamic persona profile.
   *   **Process:**  The recommendation engine will prioritize items from the adapted clusters that best match the user's current persona.
   *   **Output:** A personalized list of item recommendations.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Session Start
persona = new Persona()
adaptedClusters = existingClusters.copy()

// Each User Action (click, search, purchase)
persona.update(userAction)

// Adapt Clusters
adaptedClusters = adaptClusters(adaptedClusters, persona, userAction)

// Generate Recommendations
recommendations = generateRecommendations(adaptedClusters, persona)

//Display recommendations
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Persona Profiles: Key-value store (e.g., Redis) for fast access.
*   Adapted Clusters: In-memory cache.
*   User Activity Logs: Distributed log for long-term analysis.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Multi-Persona Modeling:  Allow the system to identify and manage multiple personas simultaneously.
*   Contextual Awareness: Integrate external data sources (e.g., location, weather) to further refine persona modeling.
*   Cross-Session Learning:  Use historical data to improve persona modeling accuracy.
