## Dynamic Blocking Key Drift with Generative Adversarial Networks

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic blocking process by introducing a “key drift” mechanism informed by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This addresses the issue of potentially over-aggressive blocking stemming from fixed or linearly decreasing similarity thresholds. Instead of simply lowering thresholds, the GAN learns to *generate* slightly altered blocking keys, expanding the search space in a controlled manner while mitigating false negatives.

**Specifications:**

**1. GAN Architecture:**

*   **Generator (G):** Takes a block's current set of blocking keys as input. Outputs a slightly modified set of blocking keys. Modifications can include:
    *   **Perturbation:** Adding small, random variations to existing key values (e.g., altering a character in a string, adding noise to a numerical value).
    *   **Substitution:** Replacing a key with a similar one based on a learned similarity metric (e.g., synonym replacement for text keys).
    *   **Expansion:**  Adding new, related blocking keys based on learned relationships between existing keys.
*   **Discriminator (D):**  Takes two sets of blocks as input: original blocks and blocks generated with modified keys.  Differentiates between the two. Trained to identify blocks that are “too far” from the original distribution (representing false positives) and blocks that are likely to contain missed matches (false negatives).

**2. Integration into Dynamic Blocking:**

*   **Initial Blocking:** Perform initial blocking as described in the referenced patent.
*   **GAN Training Phase:** After each iteration of dynamic blocking, and *before* reducing the similarity threshold, a GAN training phase occurs.  
    *   A subset of blocks from the current iteration is selected.
    *   The Generator creates modified blocking keys for these blocks.
    *   The Discriminator evaluates the modified blocks against the original blocks.
    *   The GAN's weights are updated based on the Discriminator's feedback.
*   **Key Drift Phase:** After GAN training, apply “key drift.”  For each block in the current iteration:
    *   The Generator creates a modified set of blocking keys.
    *   A new set of blocks is formed using these modified keys.
    *   These new blocks are merged with the original blocks. This increases the search space without relying solely on threshold reduction.
*   **Iterate:** Repeat the GAN training and Key Drift phases for each iteration of dynamic blocking.

**3. Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
GAN_Generator = Initialize_Generator()
GAN_Discriminator = Initialize_Discriminator()
Similarity_Threshold = Initial_Threshold
Records = Input_Records

// Dynamic Blocking Loop
while (Block_Size > Min_Block_Size):
  Blocks = Generate_Blocks(Records, Similarity_Threshold)

  // GAN Training
  Sample_Blocks = Select_Sample_From(Blocks)
  Modified_Blocks = Generate_Modified_Blocks(Sample_Blocks, GAN_Generator)
  GAN_Discriminator.Train(Modified_Blocks, Sample_Blocks)
  GAN_Generator.Update(GAN_Discriminator)

  // Key Drift
  Drifted_Blocks = Apply_Key_Drift(Blocks, GAN_Generator)
  Merged_Blocks = Merge_Blocks(Blocks, Drifted_Blocks)

  Records = Filter_Records_By_Blocks(Merged_Blocks)

  Similarity_Threshold = Adjust_Threshold(Similarity_Threshold, Decay_Rate)

  //Output Merged_Blocks
```

**4. Parameters:**

*   `Decay_Rate`: Controls how quickly the similarity threshold decreases.
*   `GAN_Learning_Rate`: Controls the learning rate of the GAN.
*   `Sample_Size`: The number of blocks used for GAN training.
*    `Min_Block_Size`: The minimum size of a block to terminate the dynamic blocking process.
*   `Key_Perturbation_Magnitude`: Scale of random noise added to existing keys during key generation.

**Novelty:**

This approach differs from conventional dynamic blocking by introducing a generative model to actively *shape* the search space, rather than simply shrinking it. By learning to generate subtly altered blocking keys, the system can explore a wider range of potential matches without relying solely on reducing similarity thresholds. This has the potential to improve recall and reduce the risk of false negatives, especially in scenarios where data quality is poor or data sources are heterogeneous. The active exploration of the search space could be particularly useful in identifying hidden relationships between records that might be missed by more conservative blocking strategies.
