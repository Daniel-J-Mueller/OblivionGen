## Decentralized Key Sharding with Bio-Authentication

**Concept:** Enhance data security and access control by combining key sharding with biometric authentication, and distributing key fragments across a decentralized network.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Generation & Sharding:**

*   **Algorithm:** Utilize a threshold secret sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing) to split the ‘object key’ (from the patent) into *n* shares.  *n* is configurable, balancing security and availability.
*   **Share Distribution:**  Instead of a central key management system, distribute these key shares across a peer-to-peer (P2P) network (e.g., using a blockchain-inspired Directed Acyclic Graph – DAG). Each node in the network stores a single key share.  Nodes are identified by a unique, cryptographically secure ID.
*   **Dynamic Node Selection:**  Implement a dynamic node selection algorithm. Upon data storage or access request, a random subset of *k* nodes (where *k* ≤ *n*) is selected to reconstruct the key. This minimizes the risk of compromise from collusion. Selection criteria could include network latency, node reputation (based on uptime and data integrity checks), and geographic diversity.

**2. Bio-Authentication Layer:**

*   **Modalities:** Support multi-factor biometric authentication, including fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, and voiceprint analysis.
*   **Template Storage:**  Biometric templates are *not* stored centrally. Instead, they are encrypted using a key derived from a user’s public key (as part of a public key infrastructure – PKI) and distributed across the same P2P network as the key shares.  Fragments of the biometric template are stored on different nodes.
*   **Live Detection:** Implement liveness detection algorithms to prevent spoofing attacks (e.g., using video analysis to verify that a face is real and not a photograph).
*   **Threshold Authentication:**  Require *m* successful biometric authentications (where *m* is configurable) to unlock access to a key share. This adds another layer of security.

**3. Data Access Flow:**

1.  **Request:** User initiates a request to access encrypted data.
2.  **Authentication:** User undergoes biometric authentication. If successful, the system retrieves the necessary biometric template fragments from the P2P network and reconstructs the template.
3.  **Key Share Request:** Once biometric authentication is confirmed, the system initiates a request for key shares from the selected *k* nodes.
4.  **Key Reconstruction:**  The selected nodes provide their key shares. These shares are combined to reconstruct the full ‘object key’.
5.  **Decryption:** The reconstructed ‘object key’ is used to decrypt the requested data.
6.  **Data Delivery:** The decrypted data is delivered to the user.

**4. System Components:**

*   **Data Management Component (Client):** Modified to interface with the decentralized key management system. Responsible for initiating requests and authenticating users.
*   **Key Management System (Decentralized):** A P2P network responsible for storing and distributing key shares. Implements the key reconstruction algorithm and handles security.
*   **Authentication Service:** Responsible for managing biometric templates and verifying user identity.
*   **Data Storage Service:** Remains largely unchanged, but now interfaces with the decentralized key management system.

**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructKey(shareList):
  // shareList is a list of key shares received from selected nodes
  reconstructedKey = combineShares(shareList)  // Uses the threshold secret sharing algorithm
  return reconstructedKey

function combineShares(shareList):
  // Implementation of the chosen threshold secret sharing algorithm
  // (e.g., Lagrange interpolation for Shamir's Secret Sharing)
  // Returns the reconstructed key
```

**Novelty:** This design moves beyond a centralized key management system and leverages the security and resilience of a decentralized P2P network. Combining this with biometric authentication and threshold authentication significantly enhances security and protects against both data breaches and unauthorized access.  The dynamic node selection algorithm adds an extra layer of robustness.
