## Dynamic Service Mesh for Edge Device Collaboration

**Concept:** Extend the local/shared service override concept to create a dynamic, peer-to-peer service mesh *between* edge computing hubs. Instead of solely overriding services for a single hub, this system enables hubs to discover, negotiate, and utilize services hosted on *other* nearby hubs, forming a temporary, collaborative mesh network.

**Specs:**

*   **Hub Identification & Discovery:** Each computing hub broadcasts a “service manifest” – a list of locally hosted services with associated metadata (capabilities, version, security credentials, resource availability).  This manifest uses a lightweight, UDP-based beaconing protocol.
*   **Service Negotiation:** When a program code function on Hub A requires a service, it doesn't immediately resolve to a shared service provider. Instead, it initiates a discovery request. A “Service Broker” module on Hub A collects responses from nearby hubs (based on beaconing). The Service Broker evaluates these based on criteria like latency, resource availability, security policy, and service version.
*   **Dynamic Proxy Creation:** Upon selecting a remote service on Hub B, a secure, temporary proxy is established. This proxy operates at the application layer (e.g., using gRPC or similar) and handles communication between the program code function on Hub A and the service on Hub B.  The proxy automatically handles serialization/deserialization and any necessary data format translations.
*   **Service Versioning & Rollback:**  The system maintains a version history of services discovered on other hubs. If a remote service experiences issues or is updated, the system can automatically roll back to a previously known-good version or switch to a different hub hosting the same service.
*   **Resource Accounting & Payment (Optional):** For deployments where resource utilization is important, a lightweight resource accounting system can be integrated. Hubs can track resource usage by remote program code functions and potentially implement a micro-payment mechanism (e.g., using a blockchain-based ledger).
*   **Security:** All inter-hub communication is encrypted using TLS/DTLS. Access control is enforced based on service policies and hub-level authentication. A trust model is established where hubs can vouch for the integrity of services hosted on other hubs.

**Pseudocode (Service Broker Module on Hub A):**

```
function discoverService(serviceName, requiredVersion):
  // Broadcast a service discovery request
  broadcast(discoveryRequest)

  // Collect responses from nearby hubs
  responses = collectResponses(timeout)

  // Filter responses based on version and criteria
  filteredResponses = filter(responses, serviceName, requiredVersion, latencyThreshold, securityPolicy)

  // Rank filtered responses based on priority
  rankedResponses = rank(filteredResponses)

  // Select the best service provider
  if (rankedResponses.length > 0):
    selectedProvider = rankedResponses[0]
    return selectedProvider
  else:
    // Fallback to shared service provider
    return sharedServiceProvider()
```
