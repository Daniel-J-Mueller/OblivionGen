## Dynamic Skill Composition for Conversational AI

**System Overview:** A modular system that composes conversational skills dynamically at runtime, based on detected user intent *and* contextual cues, allowing for highly personalized and adaptive dialogue experiences. It moves beyond simply recognizing intent to understanding the *way* an intent is expressed – its nuance, emotional tone, and relationship to prior interactions.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Intent & Nuance Encoder:** Extends the existing linguistic input encoding. Adds a layer dedicated to capturing non-semantic information: prosody (speech rate, pitch), sentiment analysis, and user-specific interaction history (a short-term memory vector). Output is a multi-dimensional vector representing both *what* the user intends and *how* they are expressing it.

2.  **Skill Library:** A repository of conversational skills, each encapsulated as a modular unit. Each skill exposes:
    *   **Activation Threshold:** A vector representing the minimum requirements from the Intent & Nuance Encoder to activate the skill.
    *   **Skill Logic:**  The core conversational logic for the skill (e.g., booking a flight, answering a question).
    *   **Contextual Modifiers:** Functions that adjust the skill's behavior based on the current dialogue context.
    *   **Output Templates:**  A set of pre-defined or dynamically generated response templates.

3.  **Skill Composer:** The central control unit. Takes the encoded input from the Intent & Nuance Encoder and:
    *   Calculates a ‘compatibility score’ between the encoded input and the Activation Threshold of each skill in the library. This uses a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity).
    *   Selects a subset of ‘candidate’ skills based on a scoring threshold.
    *   Applies Contextual Modifiers to the candidate skills, based on the current dialogue state.
    *   Prioritizes the skills based on a weighted combination of compatibility score, contextual relevance, and user preferences (learned over time).
    *   Orchestrates the selected skills to generate a coherent response.

4.  **Dynamic Weighting & Learning Module:** Continuously adjusts the weights assigned to different factors (compatibility score, contextual relevance, user preferences) based on user feedback (explicit ratings, implicit signals like engagement time) and dialogue success metrics. Uses reinforcement learning techniques to optimize skill selection and dialogue flow.

**Pseudocode (Skill Composer):**

```
function ComposeDialogue(encodedInput, dialogueState):
  candidateSkills = []
  for skill in SkillLibrary:
    compatibilityScore = CalculateSimilarity(encodedInput, skill.ActivationThreshold)
    skill.ContextualModifier(dialogueState)
    weightedScore = compatibilityScore * skill.Weight + skill.ContextualRelevance * dialogueState.ContextFactor
    if weightedScore > ActivationThreshold:
      candidateSkills.append(skill)

  candidateSkills.sort(key=lambda x: x.weightedScore, reverse=True)

  selectedSkills = candidateSkills[:N] // Select top N skills

  response = ""
  for skill in selectedSkills:
    response += skill.Execute(dialogueState)

  return response
```

**Innovation:** This system transcends the limitations of static intent recognition by creating a dynamic composition of conversational skills. The ability to sense nuance, adapt to context, and learn from user interaction enables a more natural, personalized, and engaging dialogue experience. It allows for subtle shifts in conversational style and complexity, responding not only to *what* the user says, but *how* they say it, and in relation to the ongoing interaction.
