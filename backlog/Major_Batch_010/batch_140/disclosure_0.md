## Adaptive Trust Chains with Reputation Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the domain trust chain concept by incorporating a dynamic reputation scoring system for operators and security modules. This moves beyond simple authorization based on chain verification to a probabilistic trust assessment based on observed behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Operator Reputation Database:**

*   **Data Fields:**
    *   `Operator ID`: Unique identifier for each operator.
    *   `Base Trust Score`: Initial trust score assigned to the operator.
    *   `Behavioral History`: Log of actions performed by the operator (e.g., signing domain trust updates, attesting to security module integrity).
    *   `Success Rate`: Percentage of successful attestations or signings.
    *   `Failure Rate`: Percentage of failed or contested attestations/signings.
    *   `Penalty Score`: Accumulated penalty based on negative actions (e.g., signing malicious updates, attempting unauthorized access).
    *   `Current Trust Score`: Calculated based on a weighted average of Base Trust, Success Rate, Failure Rate, and Penalty Score.
*   **Update Mechanism:**
    *   Trust Score is updated after each action performed by the operator.
    *   Weighting factors are configurable to prioritize different aspects of operator behavior.
    *   A decay mechanism gradually reduces Trust Score over time if the operator remains inactive.

**2. Security Module Reputation Database:**

*   **Data Fields:**
    *   `Module ID`: Unique identifier for the security module.
    *   `Base Trust Score`: Initial trust score.
    *   `Attestation History`: Log of remote attestations received for the module.
    *   `Attestation Success Rate`: Percentage of successful attestations.
    *   `Vulnerability Reports`: List of known vulnerabilities associated with the module.
    *   `Current Trust Score`: Calculated based on Attestation Success Rate and vulnerability reports.
*   **Update Mechanism:**
    *   Trust Score is updated after each successful remote attestation.
    *   Vulnerability reports automatically decrease Trust Score.
    *   Regular security audits can be used to update vulnerability reports.

**3. Trust Chain Verification with Reputation Scoring:**

*   **Modified Verification Process:**
    *   When verifying a domain trust update, the system checks not only the cryptographic signature but also the reputation scores of the signing operators and the security modules involved.
    *   Each operator and module contributes to an overall “trust weight” for the update.
    *   A configurable threshold determines whether the update is accepted based on the overall trust weight.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   The threshold can be adjusted dynamically based on the sensitivity of the system and the potential impact of a compromised update.
    *   Higher sensitivity settings require a higher overall trust weight for acceptance.
*   **Reputation-Based Quorum Rules:**
    *   Quorum rules can be modified to require operators with higher reputation scores to approve critical updates.

**4. Implementation Pseudocode (Trust Chain Verification):**

```
function verifyDomainTrustUpdate(update, signingOperators, securityModules):
  totalTrustWeight = 0
  for operator in signingOperators:
    totalTrustWeight += getOperatorReputationScore(operator)

  for module in securityModules:
    totalTrustWeight += getModuleReputationScore(module)

  requiredTrustWeight = getConfigurableThreshold()

  if totalTrustWeight >= requiredTrustWeight:
    // Verify cryptographic signature
    if verifySignature(update):
      return true
    else:
      return false
  else:
    return false
```

**5. Additional Considerations:**

*   **Sybil Attack Mitigation:** Implement mechanisms to prevent malicious actors from creating multiple identities to inflate their reputation scores.
*   **Data Privacy:** Securely store and manage reputation data to protect the privacy of operators and security modules.
*   **Transparency:** Provide a mechanism for operators and security modules to view their reputation scores and understand how they are calculated.
