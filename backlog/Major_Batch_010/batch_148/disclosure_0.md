## Dynamic Service Composability via Predictive Usage

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This innovation builds on the concept of usage-based service access, extending it to *proactively* compose services tailored to a user's *predicted* needs, rather than reacting to explicit requests. It anticipates user workflows and pre-provisions service access, potentially increasing efficiency and enabling previously impossible workflows.

**II. Core Components:**

1.  **Usage Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model trained on user behavior data (past service invocations, application usage, calendar events, location data, etc.). This engine predicts the *probability* of a user requiring specific service combinations within a defined timeframe. Outputs a ranked list of predicted service combinations with associated confidence scores.

2.  **Dynamic Composition Manager:**  This module receives the ranked service combination predictions from the Usage Prediction Engine.  It interacts with the access control mechanisms outlined in the provided patent to pre-authorize access to those predicted services, but *not* initiate immediate invocation. It maintains a "pending service graph" representing the predicted workflow.

3.  **Contextual Trigger:** A system for monitoring user activity and environmental data (e.g., location, time, application focus, sensor input). When the Contextual Trigger detects conditions aligning with the pending service graph, it initiates the workflow.

4.  **Adaptive Authorization:**  Authorization isnâ€™t static. The system monitors actual service usage after initiation. If predicted usage deviates significantly, authorization is dynamically adjusted (e.g., reducing allocated resources, swapping in alternative services).

**III. Pseudocode (Contextual Trigger):**

```pseudocode
function evaluateContext(userActivityData, environmentalData):
  pendingGraph = DynamicCompositionManager.getPendingGraph(user)

  if pendingGraph != null:
    graphMatches = compareContext(userActivityData, environmentalData, pendingGraph)

    if graphMatches > threshold:
      DynamicCompositionManager.initiateWorkflow(user, pendingGraph)
      return TRUE  // Workflow initiated

  return FALSE // No match, no workflow
```

**IV. Data Structures:**

*   **Pending Service Graph:** A directed acyclic graph representing the predicted workflow. Nodes represent services; edges represent data flow and dependencies.  Each edge stores authorization details (access rights, resource limits).
*   **User Activity Data:**  A time-series log of application usage, input events, and network activity.
*   **Environmental Data:**  Location data, time of day, sensor readings (e.g., accelerometer, microphone).

**V. Example Scenario:**

A user regularly attends video conferences while commuting. The Usage Prediction Engine identifies this pattern and pre-authorizes access to a noise cancellation service, a bandwidth prioritization service, and a presentation sharing service. When the user's location data indicates they are en route to a known meeting location, the Contextual Trigger initiates the pre-authorized workflow, ensuring a seamless video conference experience. If the user deviates and instead begins a phone call, the Adaptive Authorization module dynamically adjusts resource allocation, reducing bandwidth allocated to video and increasing it for audio.
