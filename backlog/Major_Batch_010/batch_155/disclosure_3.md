## DNS Request 'Shadowing' for Predictive Threat Analysis

**Concept:** Expand beyond detecting malicious patterns *within* DNS requests to proactively 'shadow' DNS requests *before* they complete, creating a predictive threat model. This allows for blocking potentially malicious domains *before* a connection is even attempted.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow DNS Server Deployment:**

*   Deploy a cluster of geographically distributed "Shadow DNS Servers" mirroring the function of the primary DNS server. These shadow servers do *not* resolve requests directly to clients.
*   Implement a high-bandwidth, low-latency connection between the primary DNS server and the Shadow DNS cluster.  All DNS requests *forwarded* to the primary DNS server are also simultaneously forwarded to the Shadow DNS cluster.

**2. Predictive Analysis Engine:**

*   The core of the system is a Predictive Analysis Engine (PAE) running *within* the Shadow DNS cluster.  This engine utilizes a multi-layered approach:
    *   **Historical Data Analysis:**  The PAE maintains a database of historical DNS request data (both resolved and unresolved) including timestamps, request origins (IP addresses, tenant IDs), requested domain names, and resolution results (IP addresses).
    *   **Behavioral Profiling:** Create behavioral profiles for each tenant (or groups of tenants based on risk profiles).  These profiles track typical DNS request patterns (frequency, types of requests, commonly resolved domains).  Employ anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forests, One-Class SVMs) to identify deviations from established baselines.
    *   **Reputation Scoring:** Integrate with external threat intelligence feeds (e.g., VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB) to assign reputation scores to requested domain names *before* resolution.
    *   **'Future State' Prediction:** Utilize Time Series Forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future DNS request patterns for each tenant.

**3. Pre-Resolution Blocking:**

*   Before a DNS request can be fully resolved, the Predictive Analysis Engine evaluates it based on the following criteria:
    *   **Anomaly Score:**  If the request deviates significantly from the tenant's established behavioral profile (high anomaly score), it is flagged.
    *   **Reputation Score:**  If the requested domain name has a low reputation score, it is flagged.
    *   **Predicted Pattern Deviation:**  If the request does not align with the predicted DNS request pattern for the tenant, it is flagged.
*   Based on a configurable threshold (weighted combination of anomaly, reputation, and prediction scores), the system can:
    *   **Block the request:** Return a NXDOMAIN response to the primary DNS server, preventing resolution.
    *   **Redirect the request:**  Redirect the request to a sinkhole or a safe landing page.
    *   **Log the request:**  Log the request for further investigation.

**4. Adaptive Learning & Feedback Loop:**

*   Implement a feedback loop to continuously refine the predictive models.
*   Monitor the accuracy of the predictions (false positives/false negatives).
*   Use the feedback data to retrain the models and adjust the thresholds.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function analyzeDNSRequest(dnsRequest):
  tenantID = dnsRequest.sourceIP
  domainName = dnsRequest.domainName

  anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(tenantID, dnsRequest)
  reputationScore = getReputationScore(domainName)
  predictedScore = calculatePredictedScore(tenantID, dnsRequest)

  combinedScore = (anomalyScore * weightAnomaly) + (reputationScore * weightReputation) + (predictedScore * weightPrediction)

  if combinedScore > threshold:
    action = determineAction(combinedScore) // Block, Redirect, Log
    return action
  else:
    return "Resolve"
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-bandwidth network infrastructure.
*   Scalable server cluster for Shadow DNS servers and Predictive Analysis Engine.
*   Sufficient storage for historical DNS data and model training.
*   GPU acceleration for machine learning models.
