## Dynamic Content Stitching with Predictive Highlighting

**Concept:** Extend the existing system to not only map individual content within an omnibus but to *predict* user highlighting and annotation needs *before* the user reaches that section within the omnibus. This moves beyond reactive supplemental content display to a proactive, personalized reading/viewing experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Data Structure: “Content Anticipation Graph” (CAG)**

   *   Nodes: Represent segments of individual content (e.g., chapters, scenes, paragraphs, keyframes).
   *   Edges: Represent relationships between segments, weighted by:
        *   **Semantic Similarity:**  Calculated using NLP techniques (e.g., BERT embeddings) comparing segment content.
        *   **Historical User Behavior:** Aggregated data on where users spend time, highlight, annotate, or share content *similar* to the current segment.
        *   **Collaborative Filtering:**  Predictions based on the behavior of users with similar profiles.
        *   **Predictive Highlighting Probability:** A score representing the likelihood a user will interact with this segment.

**2. Pre-Processing Stage – CAG Generation**

   *   Upon ingestion of individual content, create a node in the CAG for each logical segment.
   *   Calculate semantic similarity between all segments within *all* individual content.
   *   Populate historical user behavior data from existing user profiles and usage logs.
   *   Apply collaborative filtering algorithms to generate initial Predictive Highlighting Probabilities.
   *   Dynamically update the CAG as new user data becomes available.

**3. Omnibus Construction & Mapping**

   *   During omnibus creation, integrate CAG nodes corresponding to individual content segments.
   *   Utilize the existing string search/fingerprinting techniques to accurately map individual content within the omnibus.
   *   Extend the existing association set to include “Predictive Highlighting Score” for each mapped segment.

**4. Runtime – Personalized Experience**

   *   As the user navigates the omnibus:
        *   Identify the current segment.
        *   Retrieve the associated Predictive Highlighting Score.
        *   If the score exceeds a defined threshold:
            *   Pre-highlight relevant text (or indicate keyframes) based on the most common user annotations for similar content.
            *   Suggest relevant footnotes, links, or annotations.
            *   Trigger audio comments or visual cues.
        *   Continuously refine the Predictive Highlighting Scores based on the user's *actual* interaction with the content. (Reinforcement Learning)

**5.  Technical Details/Pseudocode**

```pseudocode
// Function: Calculate Semantic Similarity
function calculate_semantic_similarity(segment1, segment2):
  embedding1 = generate_embedding(segment1) // Using BERT or similar
  embedding2 = generate_embedding(segment2)
  similarity = cosine_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)
  return similarity

// Function: Update CAG (Simplified)
function update_cag(segment, user_interaction):
  // Increase weight on edges connecting this segment to similar segments
  // based on user_interaction (highlight, annotation, time spent)
  for neighbor in get_neighbors(segment):
    edge_weight = get_edge_weight(segment, neighbor)
    edge_weight += user_interaction_score
    set_edge_weight(segment, neighbor, edge_weight)

// Runtime - Content Delivery
function deliver_content_segment(segment, user_profile):
  predictive_score = get_predictive_score(segment, user_profile)
  if predictive_score > threshold:
    // Apply pre-highlighting, suggest annotations
    apply_visual_enhancements(segment)
  return segment
```

**6. Considerations**

*   Privacy: Anonymize user data used for predictive modeling.
*   Scalability: Efficiently manage a large and dynamic CAG.
*   Computational Cost: Optimize embedding generation and similarity calculations.
*   Personalization: Fine-tune thresholds and algorithms to cater to individual user preferences.
