## Dynamic Procedural Detail Generation – “Micro-Worlds”

**Concept:** Extend the ability to manipulate objects within the paused video frame by *procedurally generating* detailed “micro-worlds” *inside* those objects, visible through a dynamic viewport within the paused frame. This moves beyond simple manipulation of the existing model to creation of entirely new, interactive content *within* the original object.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Function:** When a user interacts with an object in the paused video, rather than just repositioning or rotating it, a request is sent to a procedural generation engine.
*   **Procedural Engine:** The engine generates a 3D environment *inside* the selected object, respecting the object's original boundaries as a container. Parameters for generation are seeded by the object’s identified category (e.g., a car generates a detailed engine bay, a building generates interior rooms, a fruit generates cellular structure). This isn’t a static texture; it’s a fully traversable space.
*   **Dynamic Viewport:** A user-controlled viewport opens *within* the paused video frame, displaying the generated micro-world. Users can navigate this interior space using standard controls (WASD, mouse look, etc.). The viewport’s size and position are adjustable.
*   **Level of Detail (LOD) & Streaming:** The micro-world is generated and streamed in LOD stages, starting with a low-poly base and progressively adding detail as the user navigates closer.
*   **Interaction & Simulation:** Basic physics and interaction are implemented within the micro-world. Users might be able to manipulate objects inside, trigger animations, or even run simple simulations.
*   **Data Persistence (Optional):**  Allow users to save modifications to the micro-world for later viewing or sharing.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function onObjectSelected(objectID):
  requestProceduralWorldGeneration(objectID)

function requestProceduralWorldGeneration(objectID):
  // Determine object category (e.g., "car", "building", "fruit")
  category = getObjectCategory(objectID)

  // Seed procedural generation engine with category and object parameters
  generationParameters = {
    category: category,
    objectID: objectID,
    // Additional parameters like size, shape, material properties
  }
  generateWorldRequest = {
    parameters: generationParameters
  }
  sendRequestToProceduralEngine(generateWorldRequest)

function onWorldGenerated(worldData):
  // Create dynamic viewport within paused video frame
  viewport = createViewport(worldData.size, worldData.position)

  // Load world data into viewport
  loadWorld(viewport, worldData.geometry, worldData.textures, worldData.physics)

  // Enable user controls for navigating the micro-world
  enableUserControls(viewport)

function enableUserControls(viewport):
  // Bind WASD, mouse look, and other controls to viewport camera
  // Implement collision detection and basic physics interactions
```

**Innovation:**

This goes beyond manipulating a surface-level model. It creates a genuinely immersive experience by building *inside* the object. It transforms passive video viewing into active exploration, adding a new dimension to video content. Imagine dissecting a machine, exploring the interior of a building, or visualizing the inner workings of a biological organism – all within the paused frame of a video.
