**Dynamic Emotional Resonance Profiling for Content Delivery**

**Concept:** Extend the play history analysis to incorporate real-time physiological data from the user to dynamically adjust content recommendations, going beyond simple co-occurrence to account for emotional impact.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Acquisition:** Integrate with wearable sensors (smartwatches, fitness trackers, EEG headsets - optional) to capture physiological signals – heart rate variability (HRV), skin conductance (GSR), and potentially brainwave activity (EEG).
*   **Real-time Signal Processing:** Implement algorithms to extract emotional states from physiological data.  (e.g., high HRV & low GSR = relaxed/focused, low HRV & high GSR = stressed/excited).  Utilize machine learning models trained on labelled datasets to classify emotional states.
*   **Content Tagging:**  Extend the digital work metadata to include "Emotional Profiles." These profiles would be generated using a combination of:
    *   **Algorithmic Analysis:** Analyze audio/video features (tempo, key, timbre, color palettes, scene changes, dialogue sentiment) to estimate emotional content.
    *   **Crowdsourced Emotional Labelling:**  Allow users to tag works with emotional keywords (e.g., “uplifting,” “melancholy,” “intense,” “calming”).
*   **Recommendation Engine:**
    1.  **Baseline Profile:** Establish a baseline emotional profile for each user based on their historical physiological data during content consumption.
    2.  **Real-time Emotional State Detection:**  Continuously monitor the user's physiological signals during content playback.
    3.  **Dynamic Recommendation Adjustment:**
        *   If the user exhibits signs of stress or negative emotion, prioritize recommendations with calming or uplifting Emotional Profiles.
        *   If the user exhibits signs of low engagement, prioritize recommendations with high energy or surprising Emotional Profiles.
        *   Use reinforcement learning to optimize the recommendation strategy based on user feedback (e.g., skip rate, completion rate).
*   **Session Context:** Account for time of day, location (if permitted), and activity (e.g., exercising, commuting, relaxing) to refine the emotional profile and recommendation strategy.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  Implement robust privacy controls. Users should have explicit control over data collection and usage. All physiological data should be anonymized and stored securely.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Adjustment):**

```
function adjust_recommendation(user, current_work, physiological_data):
  emotional_state = analyze_physiological_data(physiological_data)
  target_emotional_profile = determine_target_profile(emotional_state, user.preferences, current_work.emotional_profile)
  candidate_works = filter_works_by_emotional_profile(target_emotional_profile)
  // Incorporate existing co-occurrence logic from patent
  co_occurrence_scores = calculate_co_occurrence_scores(candidate_works, user.play_history)
  // Combine emotional profile score and co-occurrence score
  combined_scores =  (emotional_profile_score * weight_emotional) + (co_occurrence_score * weight_co_occurrence)
  recommended_work = select_work_with_highest_score(combined_scores)
  return recommended_work
```

**Novelty:** This expands beyond simple co-occurrence analysis to incorporate real-time emotional state, creating a truly personalized and dynamic recommendation system.  It moves from *what* people listen to, to *how* they feel while listening, and adapts recommendations accordingly.
