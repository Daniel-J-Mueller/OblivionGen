## Dynamic Affiliate ‘Mood Board’ Generation

**Concept:** Extend the existing item association analysis to dynamically generate visual ‘mood boards’ for affiliate websites, optimized for engagement *beyond* simple purchase prediction. This moves beyond recommending *what* to link, to influencing *how* the affiliate presents products.

**Specs:**

1.  **Affiliate Aesthetic Profiling:**
    *   Input: Scrape affiliate website visual elements (color palettes, image styles, typography).
    *   Process: Utilize computer vision & style transfer algorithms to create a numerical 'aesthetic profile' - a multi-dimensional vector representing the site's visual brand.
2.  **Item Visual Attribute Extraction:**
    *   Input: Product images from the electronic catalog.
    *   Process: Employ computer vision to extract visual attributes (dominant colors, textures, shapes, detected objects/scenes). Store as a vector similar to the aesthetic profile.
3.  **Mood Board Composition Engine:**
    *   Input: Affiliate Aesthetic Profile, Item Visual Attributes, Item Association Data.
    *   Process: 
        *   Prioritize item associations based on predicted purchase likelihood (from the existing system).
        *   Select images of associated items that exhibit visual attributes *closest* to the affiliate’s aesthetic profile. This goes beyond simply listing relevant items; it prioritizes those that *fit* the affiliate’s style.
        *   Dynamically generate a ‘mood board’ image collage (e.g., using a grid or artistic arrangement).
        *   The collage output should be a single image file (PNG, JPG) optimized for web display.
        *   Include parameters for layout control (grid size, image overlap, border radius etc.).
4.  **A/B Testing Framework:**
    *   The system automatically generates multiple mood board variations (different layouts, image selections) for each affiliate.
    *   Integrate with affiliate website analytics to track click-through rates and conversion rates for each variation.
    *   Utilize a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize mood board generation over time, learning which visual styles are most effective for each affiliate.
5.  **API Integration:**
    *   Provide an API for affiliates to easily request mood boards.
    *   Allow affiliates to specify preferences (e.g., desired mood, target audience).
    *   Support dynamic mood board updates (e.g., seasonal themes, promotional campaigns).

**Pseudocode (Mood Board Composition Engine):**

```
function generateMoodBoard(affiliateProfile, itemAssociations, catalog):
  selectedItems = []
  for item in itemAssociations:
    itemAttributes = extractVisualAttributes(catalog[item])
    similarityScore = calculateSimilarity(affiliateProfile, itemAttributes)
    selectedItems.append((item, similarityScore))

  selectedItems.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True) # Sort by similarity
  topNItems = selectedItems[:10] # Select top 10 items

  layout = generateLayout(topNItems) # Create image layout

  moodBoardImage = createImage(layout) # Generate image

  return moodBoardImage
```

**Novelty:** This extends the existing system from simple recommendation to proactive visual styling. It moves beyond predicting *what* affiliates should link to, to helping them *how* to present those links in a visually compelling way, aligned with their brand and likely to improve engagement. This goes beyond pure performance metrics and incorporates aesthetic considerations.
