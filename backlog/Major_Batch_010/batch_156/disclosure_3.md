## Adaptive Session Sharding & Predictive Token Refresh

**Concept:** Extend the persistent connection concept by dynamically sharding user sessions across multiple server instances *before* failure, and proactively refreshing/rotating tokens based on predicted server load/health, instead of solely reacting to outages. This aims to reduce latency and increase resilience beyond simple failover.

**Specs:**

**1. Session Sharding Module:**

*   **Input:** Incoming webclient connection request.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a consistent hashing algorithm (e.g., Rendezvous Hashing) based on a unique client identifier (e.g., browser fingerprint, account ID) to determine the primary server instance responsible for the session.
    *   Implement a shadow-writing mechanism:  Each request is simultaneously processed by the primary and a secondary server instance.  The secondary server validates the request, performs initial processing, and stores session data in a shared, distributed data store (e.g., Redis cluster, DynamoDB). 
    *   Monitor the health and load of both primary and secondary servers.
    *   If the primary server's health degrades (high latency, error rate), automatically switch the active session to the secondary server without client interruption.
*   **Output:**  Established session on designated server; session data mirrored across active/standby instances.

**2. Predictive Token Refresh Service:**

*   **Input:**  Real-time server load metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O), historical session activity data, token expiration timestamps.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict server load.
    *   Define a "load threshold" â€“ the point at which the system proactively begins token refresh operations.
    *   When predicted load exceeds the threshold, initiate asynchronous token refresh requests to the authentication server.
    *   Issue new tokens with extended expiration times, and securely deliver them to the webclient via a persistent WebSocket connection.
    *   Implement a dual-token system:  The client maintains both an active token and a pre-fetched, valid token.  On token expiration/revocation, seamlessly switch to the pre-fetched token.
*   **Output:**  Refreshed/pre-fetched tokens delivered to the webclient; minimized authentication latency.

**3.  Distributed Data Store Interface:**

*   **API:** Standard CRUD operations for session data (user profile, preferences, active connections).
*   **Data Model:** Session data is structured as key-value pairs, with the key being a unique session ID and the value containing all relevant session information.
*   **Replication & Consistency:** Implement a strongly consistent replication strategy to ensure data integrity across all server instances.
*   **Caching Layer:**  Utilize an in-memory caching layer (e.g., Memcached, Redis) to reduce data access latency.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Token Refresh Service):**

```
function predictServerLoad(historicalData):
  # Time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet)
  predictedLoad = model.predict(historicalData)
  return predictedLoad

function refreshTokens(sessionID, userID):
  # Request new tokens from Authentication Server
  newTokens = AuthenticationServer.getToken(userID)
  # Securely deliver tokens to webclient via WebSocket
  WebSocket.send(sessionID, newTokens)

while True:
  serverLoad = predictServerLoad(historicalData)
  if serverLoad > loadThreshold:
    for sessionID in activeSessions:
      userID = getAssociatedUserID(sessionID)
      refreshTokens(sessionID, userID)
  sleep(refreshInterval)
```
