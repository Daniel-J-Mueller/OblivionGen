## Adaptive Embedding Weighting via Temporal Decay & Confidence Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the embedding vector feature set concept by introducing a dynamic weighting system that prioritizes recent, high-confidence observations while actively decaying the influence of older or less reliable data. This will improve re-identification accuracy, particularly in dynamic environments with frequent occlusions or changing agent appearances.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `AgentState`:  Structure to represent the state of an agent.
    *   `embedding_set`: List of `EmbeddingVector` objects.
    *   `confidence_scores`: List of floats corresponding to confidence scores for each `EmbeddingVector` in `embedding_set`.
    *   `timestamp`: List of floats representing when each embedding was generated.
    *   `decay_rate`: Float representing the rate at which embedding weights decay over time (tunable parameter).
    *   `confidence_threshold`: Float representing the minimum confidence score to retain an embedding (tunable parameter).

**2. Algorithm – Embedding Update & Weighting:**

```pseudocode
function update_agent_state(new_embedding, confidence_score, timestamp, agent_state):
    # Add new embedding data
    agent_state.embedding_set.append(new_embedding)
    agent_state.confidence_scores.append(confidence_score)
    agent_state.timestamp.append(timestamp)

    # Temporal Decay – apply to all embeddings
    for i in range(len(agent_state.embedding_set)):
        time_difference = current_time - agent_state.timestamp[i]
        decay_factor = exp(-time_difference * agent_state.decay_rate)
        agent_state.confidence_scores[i] *= decay_factor

    # Confidence Thresholding – remove low-confidence embeddings
    indices_to_remove = [i for i, score in enumerate(agent_state.confidence_scores) if score < agent_state.confidence_threshold]
    for index in sorted(indices_to_remove, reverse=True):
        del agent_state.embedding_set[index]
        del agent_state.confidence_scores[index]
        del agent_state.timestamp[index]

    # Limit Embedding Set Size – Maintain a fixed maximum size to prevent memory overload
    max_embedding_size = 10  # Tunable parameter
    if len(agent_state.embedding_set) > max_embedding_size:
        # Sort embeddings by confidence score (descending)
        sorted_indices = sorted(range(len(agent_state.embedding_set)), key=lambda i: agent_state.confidence_scores[i], reverse=True)
        indices_to_keep = sorted_indices[:max_embedding_size]
        indices_to_remove = [i for i in range(len(agent_state.embedding_set)) if i not in indices_to_keep]
        for index in sorted(indices_to_remove, reverse=True):
            del agent_state.embedding_set[index]
            del agent_state.confidence_scores[index]
            del agent_state.timestamp[index]

    return agent_state
```

**3. Re-Identification Process:**

*   During re-identification, the algorithm calculates a weighted similarity score between a candidate embedding and the existing embeddings in the `agent_state.embedding_set`.
*   The weights are derived from the `agent_state.confidence_scores` after applying temporal decay.
*   A higher weighted similarity score indicates a stronger match.

**4. System Integration:**

*   The algorithm can be integrated into the existing image analysis and machine learning pipeline.
*   The `confidence_score` can be derived from the image processing confidence associated with detecting and extracting the embedding vector.
*   The `decay_rate` and `confidence_threshold` parameters should be tuned through experimentation to optimize performance in specific environments.

**5.  Novelty:** The concept combines temporal decay with confidence-based weighting of embedding vectors. This approach actively manages the feature set, prioritizing the most recent and reliable information, which enhances re-identification accuracy in challenging scenarios, such as crowded environments with frequent occlusions.  The fixed embedding set size also adds a performance boost.
