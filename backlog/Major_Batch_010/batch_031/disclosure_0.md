## Dynamic Format Chaining & Predictive Transcoding

**Concept:** Extend the system to not just transcode to *preferred* formats, but to dynamically chain transcodes based on *predicted* device capabilities and network conditions. This moves beyond simply matching a device's known preference to anticipating its needs *before* the request arrives.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Transcoding Engine (PTE)
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Historical Device Data: Device type, OS, screen resolution, CPU/GPU specs, typical network connection speed (WiFi, cellular - 5G, 4G, 3G), user viewing/listening habits (resolution preference, codec preference).
    *   Real-Time Network Monitoring:  API access to network speed tests, latency measurements for the userâ€™s current connection. Could integrate with carrier APIs for predictive bandwidth assessment.
    *   Content Analysis: Analyze the source file for complexity (bitrate, resolution, frame rate, audio channels) to determine transcoding cost.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Baseline Prediction:** When a file is uploaded, the PTE estimates optimal transcoding targets based on historical device data for the customer-owned identity.  Multiple targets are generated, prioritized by a 'quality score' (balancing resolution, bitrate, codec efficiency) and 'transcoding cost'.
    2.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Before delivering the file to a requesting device, the PTE factors in real-time network conditions.
        *   If network bandwidth is limited, the PTE downgrades the target format to a lower bitrate/resolution.  A tiered system of pre-transcoded files is maintained for rapid response.
        *   If network latency is high, the PTE may favor a more compressible codec (e.g., VP9 over H.264) even if it results in slightly lower visual quality.
    3.  **Format Chaining:** Instead of a single transcode, the PTE can chain multiple transcodes in sequence.
        *   Example: Uploaded 4K HDR file -> Transcode 1: Downscale to 1080p -> Transcode 2: Convert to VP9 -> Transcode 3: Reduce Bitrate to 5Mbps.
    4.  **Client Hints Integration:** Utilize HTTP Client Hints to obtain more detailed device capabilities directly from the browser/app, refining the transcoding targets.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `DeviceProfile`: Stores historical device data (OS, CPU, screen resolution, preferred codecs, etc.).
    *   `NetworkProfile`: Stores real-time network data (bandwidth, latency, signal strength).
    *   `TranscodeProfile`: Defines a specific transcoding target (resolution, bitrate, codec, frame rate).
    *   `TranscodeChain`: An ordered list of `TranscodeProfile` objects.
*   **Pseudocode (Transcode Selection):**

```
function selectTranscode(file, deviceProfile, networkProfile):
  transcodeChains = generateTranscodeChains(file) // Based on initial analysis & deviceProfile
  
  // Score each chain based on network conditions
  for chain in transcodeChains:
    chain.score = calculateNetworkScore(chain, networkProfile)
  
  // Sort chains by score (highest to lowest)
  transcodeChains.sort(by: score)

  // Return the highest-scoring chain
  return transcodeChains[0]
```

*   **Storage:**  Pre-transcoded file tiers are stored in a tiered storage system (e.g., SSD for high-priority, frequently accessed files, HDD for archival).
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/transcode/predict`: Accepts file metadata and returns predicted transcoding chains.
    *   `/transcode/status`: Returns the status of a transcoding job.
