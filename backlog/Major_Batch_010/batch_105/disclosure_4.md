## Dynamic File Reconstruction with Temporal Anchors

**Concept:** Extend peer-to-peer collaboration to support reconstruction of file versions *across* disconnected sessions, leveraging a distributed, temporally-anchored data structure. This goes beyond simple version control, aiming for a continuously evolving, collaboratively-authored "file-as-process" rather than a series of discrete versions.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Temporal Anchor Generation:** Each computing device participating in collaboration generates a 'Temporal Anchor' â€“ a cryptographic hash combining the current file state, a high-resolution timestamp (down to milliseconds), and a unique device identifier. This anchor is broadcast over the P2P connection.

2.  **Anchor Graph Construction:** Receiving devices store these anchors in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Edges represent the temporal relationship between file states as perceived by different devices. Discrepancies in timestamps or file hashes create branching paths in the graph.

3.  **Differential Chunking:**  File changes are not transmitted as complete files or simple diffs. Instead, the file is divided into variable-sized "chunks" based on content similarity. Modifications are expressed as additions, deletions, or updates to specific chunks.

4.  **P2P Chunk Propagation:** When a device modifies the file, only the affected chunks, along with the new Temporal Anchor, are propagated to peers. The DAG is used to determine which peers require the update, minimizing bandwidth usage.

5.  **Reconstruction Algorithm:**
    *   A device receiving chunk updates queries the DAG for the most recent Temporal Anchor representing a consistent file state.
    *   The algorithm traverses the DAG, collecting necessary chunks (including those from multiple peers) associated with that anchor.
    *   Conflicts (multiple updates to the same chunk) are resolved using a rule-based system (e.g., last-write-wins, conflict markers, or user-defined merge strategies).
    *   The complete file is reconstructed from the collected chunks.

6.  **Offline Operation & Synchronization:**
    *   Devices can continue editing files offline.  Local changes are stored with the device's last known Temporal Anchor.
    *   When connectivity is restored, the device attempts to synchronize its local changes with the distributed graph.
    *   The algorithm identifies divergences (conflicts) and presents them to the user for resolution.

7. **Metadata Layer**: Implement a metadata layer appended to each chunk allowing for AI-driven conflict resolution and automated suggestion of merge strategies. This metadata includes semantic information about the chunk (e.g. identified object, text type, purpose).

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Algorithm):**

```
function reconstructFile(targetAnchor):
  // Get the latest Temporal Anchor from the DAG
  latestAnchor = findAnchor(targetAnchor)

  // Initialize an empty file buffer
  fileBuffer = emptyBuffer()

  // Collect chunks associated with the target anchor
  requiredChunks = getChunks(latestAnchor)

  // Sort chunks based on their logical order (e.g., file offset)
  sortedChunks = sortChunks(requiredChunks)

  // Append chunks to the file buffer
  for each chunk in sortedChunks:
    appendChunk(fileBuffer, chunk)

  // Return the reconstructed file
  return fileBuffer
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires robust P2P communication framework (e.g., WebRTC, Bluetooth Mesh)
*   Efficient DAG data structure and search algorithms
*   Secure chunk transmission and validation (digital signatures)
*   Conflict resolution interface for user intervention
*   AI framework for metadata processing and conflict resolution.
