## Dynamic Token Masking & Reveal

**Concept:** Expand upon the format-preserving tokenization by introducing a system where the token itself isn't a static representation of the data, but a dynamically revealing 'mask'.  The initial token reveals minimal information. Subsequent authorized requests 'unmask' layers of the original data, progressively revealing more detail, controlled by access permissions and a ‘reveal history’.

**Specifications:**

**1. Token Structure:**

*   **Layered Token:** Tokens are composed of multiple 'layers' of encoded data. Each layer represents a different granularity of information from the original data object. 
*   **Reveal Flags:**  Each layer has an associated ‘reveal flag’ – a bitmask indicating which layers are currently visible to the requesting client.
*   **Checksum/Integrity:** Each layer includes a checksum to ensure data integrity during reveal operations.
*   **Version Control:** Each layer maintains a version number to manage updates and allow for rollback.

**2.  Reveal API:**

*   `revealToken(token, layerIndex, clientID, requestID)`:  Request to reveal a specific layer of the token.  `requestID` is for auditing and preventing replay attacks.
*   `getRevealHistory(token, clientID)`: Returns a log of which layers have been revealed to a given client, including timestamps and request IDs.
*   `setRevealPolicy(token, clientID, policy)`:  Defines a policy for automatic layer revealing based on client roles or permissions. Example: "reveal layer 3 if client role is 'analyst'".
*   `maskToken(token, layerIndex)`:  Forcefully mask a layer, removing access even if previously revealed. (Admin function).

**3.  Tokenization Service Modifications:**

*   **Layered Encoding:**  The `add function` now supports defining the number of layers and the encoding strategy for each layer during token creation.  Encoding can include:
    *   **Redaction:**  Replacing parts of the data with asterisks or other masking characters.
    *   **Truncation:**  Reducing the precision or length of the data.
    *   **Generalization:**  Replacing specific values with broader categories.
    *   **Encryption:** Encrypting individual layers for enhanced security.
*   **Policy Enforcement:**  The service must enforce reveal policies during `revealToken` requests. This requires access to the client’s permissions and the stored reveal history.
*   **Auditing:** All reveal operations must be logged for auditing and compliance.

**4. Data Store Extensions:**

*   **Reveal History Table:** A table to store the reveal history for each token, including client ID, layer index, timestamp, and request ID.
*   **Policy Storage:**  Storage for reveal policies, potentially linked to client roles or groups.

**Pseudocode – `revealToken` Function:**

```
function revealToken(token, layerIndex, clientID, requestID):
  // 1. Authenticate client and verify request integrity
  if not authenticateClient(clientID, requestID) then
    return ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED

  // 2. Retrieve token metadata and reveal history
  tokenMetadata = getTokenMetadata(token)
  revealHistory = getRevealHistory(token, clientID)

  // 3. Check if layer is already revealed
  if layerIndex in revealHistory then
    return SUCCESS // Layer already revealed

  // 4. Check reveal policy
  if not checkRevealPolicy(token, clientID, layerIndex) then
    return ERROR_POLICY_DENIED

  // 5. Retrieve encrypted/masked layer data
  layerData = getLayerData(token, layerIndex)

  // 6. Decrypt/unmask layer data
  unmaskedData = decryptLayer(layerData)

  // 7. Update reveal history
  addRevealHistory(token, clientID, layerIndex)

  // 8. Return unmasked data
  return SUCCESS, unmaskedData
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Sensitive Data Sharing:** Share customer data with third parties while controlling the level of detail revealed.
*   **Compliance & Regulation:**  Meet data privacy regulations by selectively revealing data based on user roles and permissions.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:**  Reveal information gradually to users based on their interactions with the system.
*   **Dynamic Access Control:**  Change access permissions on the fly without re-tokenizing the data.
