## Dynamic Data Provenance & Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Expand the data quality identification beyond simple inconsistencies and missing values to encompass *data provenance* and assign a *trust score* to each attribute value based on its journey and contributing sources.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Provenance Tracking:**

*   **Provenance Graph:** Maintain a directed graph for each attribute, tracking its origin and all transformations it undergoes. Nodes represent data sources, transformation processes (e.g., cleansing, aggregation), and system components involved. Edges represent the flow of data.
*   **Metadata Enrichment:** Automatically enrich data with provenance metadata at each stage. Include timestamps, user IDs (if applicable), transformation details, and a unique transaction ID for auditability.
*   **Standardized Provenance Format:** Adopt a standardized format for provenance metadata (e.g., W3C PROV-DM) to ensure interoperability and facilitate data exchange.

**2. Trust Score Calculation:**

*   **Source Trust:** Assign an initial trust score to each data source based on factors like historical accuracy, reputation, and data validation procedures. This can be a manual or automated process.
*   **Transformation Impact:** Evaluate the impact of each transformation on data quality. Transformations that introduce ambiguity or potential errors should decrease the trust score.
*   **Propagation Algorithm:** Implement an algorithm to propagate trust scores through the provenance graph. The trust score of an attribute value should be a weighted average of the trust scores of its contributing sources and transformations.  Consider decay functions to diminish trust with each hop.
    *   `Trust(Value_t) = Σ [Weight(Source_i) * Trust(Source_i)] + Σ [Weight(Transformation_j) * Trust(Transformation_j)]`
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Identify anomalies in provenance paths (e.g., unexpected data sources, unauthorized transformations) and reduce the trust score accordingly.

**3. UI Integration & Actionable Insights:**

*   **Visual Provenance Explorer:** Provide a UI component that allows users to visualize the provenance graph for any attribute. This could be an interactive graph or a timeline view.
*   **Trust Score Display:**  Display the trust score alongside each attribute value in the UI.  Use visual cues (e.g., color-coding, icons) to indicate the level of trust.
*   **Alerting & Remediation:**  Generate alerts when the trust score falls below a predefined threshold.  Provide suggestions for remediation, such as investigating the data source or re-validating the data.
*   **"Trust Path" Feature:**  Allow users to trace the "trust path" of an attribute value, showing all the sources and transformations that contributed to its current value.

**Pseudocode (Trust Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(attributeValue, provenanceGraph):
  trustScore = 0
  totalWeight = 0

  for source in provenanceGraph.sources:
    weight = source.trustRating * source.contributionFactor
    trustScore += weight * source.trustScore
    totalWeight += weight

  for transformation in provenanceGraph.transformations:
    weight = transformation.impactRating * transformation.contributionFactor
    trustScore += weight * transformation.trustScore
    totalWeight += weight

  if totalWeight > 0:
    trustScore = trustScore / totalWeight

  return trustScore
```

**Expansion:** Incorporate external trust sources (e.g., data quality ratings from third-party providers) and allow users to customize the trust score calculation algorithm based on their specific needs. This could be exposed as a configurable parameter within the system.
