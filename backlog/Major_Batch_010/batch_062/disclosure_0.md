## Temporal Graph Embedding with Predictive Anomaly Scoring

**Specification:**

This system extends the graph-based anomaly detection described in patent 9225730 by incorporating temporal graph embeddings and a predictive anomaly scoring mechanism. It moves beyond reactive anomaly detection to proactive prediction.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Temporal Graph Construction:**
    *   Data Source: Same event data as in the patent (interactions between entities – host devices, processes, services).
    *   Graph Evolution: The graph is *not static*. It's rebuilt (or incrementally updated) at regular time intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes, hourly). This creates a series of *temporal graphs* – G<sub>t</sub>, G<sub>t+1</sub>, G<sub>t+2</sub>… representing the network state at different points in time.
    *   Edge Weighting: Edge weights are determined not just by event frequency but also by *recency*. More recent events contribute more to the edge weight. Formula: `weight(e) = frequency(e) * exp(-decay_rate * time_since_last_event(e))`.

2.  **Node & Edge Embedding Generation:**
    *   Algorithm: Utilize a Temporal Graph Embedding algorithm (e.g., TGCN, DySAT, or a custom variant). These algorithms learn low-dimensional vector representations (embeddings) for each node (entity) and edge in the temporal graph. The embedding captures the entity’s role in the network *and* how that role evolves over time.
    *   Embedding Dimensionality: Configurable (e.g., 64, 128, 256 dimensions).
    *   Embedding Updates: Embeddings are recalculated with each new temporal graph (or incrementally updated).

3.  **Anomaly Prediction Model:**
    *   Model Type: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.
    *   Input: Sequence of Node & Edge Embeddings. The LSTM receives a time series of the node/edge embeddings generated from the temporal graphs.
    *   Output: Predicted Embedding. The LSTM predicts the *next* embedding in the sequence.
    *   Anomaly Score Calculation: The anomaly score is based on the reconstruction error between the predicted embedding and the actual embedding.
        *   Reconstruction Error:  Use Mean Squared Error (MSE) or a similar metric to quantify the difference between the predicted and actual embeddings.
        *   Anomaly Score: `AnomalyScore(t) = MSE(PredictedEmbedding(t+1), ActualEmbedding(t+1)) * RiskFactor(t+1)`.  The `RiskFactor` is a weighted sum of the risk metrics (from the original patent) associated with the events contributing to the `ActualEmbedding(t+1)`.

4.  **Dynamic Thresholding:**
    *   Baseline Calculation: Establish a baseline anomaly score using a rolling window of historical data.
    *   Threshold Adjustment: Dynamically adjust the anomaly score threshold based on the baseline and statistical deviations.  This prevents false positives during periods of high network activity.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Loop):**

```
// Initialization
baseline_window = [Anomaly Scores from last N time intervals]
threshold = calculate_threshold(baseline_window)

for each new time interval t:
    // 1. Construct Temporal Graph G_t
    temporal_graph = construct_temporal_graph(event_data_t)

    // 2. Generate Node & Edge Embeddings
    node_embeddings, edge_embeddings = generate_embeddings(temporal_graph)

    // 3. Predict Next Embedding (using LSTM)
    predicted_embedding = lstm_model.predict(node_embeddings, edge_embeddings)

    // 4. Calculate Anomaly Score
    anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(predicted_embedding, node_embeddings, edge_embeddings)

    // 5. Detect Anomaly
    if anomaly_score > threshold:
        // Trigger alert and investigation
        print("Anomaly detected at time", t, "Score:", anomaly_score)

    // 6. Update Baseline & Threshold
    update_baseline(anomaly_score)
    threshold = calculate_threshold(baseline_window)
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Time series of node/edge embeddings
*   Anomaly scores
*   Historical event data

**Scalability:**

*   Distributed graph processing framework (e.g., Apache Giraph, GraphX) for graph construction and embedding generation.
*   GPU acceleration for LSTM training and inference.

**Novelty:**

This design moves beyond *detecting* anomalies to *predicting* them, allowing for proactive security measures.  The combination of temporal graph embeddings, LSTM-based prediction, and dynamic thresholding provides a more robust and accurate anomaly detection system.
