## Dynamic Data Path ‘Shadowing’ for Anomaly Detection & Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the existing path detection to create a ‘shadow’ representation of data flow – not just *if* a path exists, but a probabilistic model of *how often* data traverses it, and predict future path utilization. This moves beyond simple connectivity to active, predictive data flow analysis.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & ‘Path Frequency’ Metric:**

*   **Data Sources:** Network logs (as per patent), application-level telemetry, and potentially even packet capture (sampling for performance).
*   **Frequency Tracking:**  For each detected path (node sequence), maintain a ‘Path Frequency’ metric.  This isn’t just a binary ‘path exists’ but a count of data flows observed over a rolling time window.  Implement exponential decay to de-emphasize stale data.
*   **Weighting:** Weight frequency updates based on data volume/importance.  E.g., a high-bandwidth transaction impacting critical data should increase the path frequency more significantly than a small, low-priority communication.  Categorization of data (e.g., financial data, PII) is essential.

**2. Probabilistic Path Modeling:**

*   **Path Probability:**  Calculate a ‘Path Probability’ for each path:  `Path Probability = Path Frequency / Total Observed Data Flow`.  This provides a normalized measure of how often the path is *actually* used, relative to all network activity.
*   **Path Vectors:** Represent each data flow as a ‘Path Vector’ – a sequence of Path Probabilities corresponding to the nodes traversed.  E.g., if a data flow goes A->B->C, the Path Vector is [P(A->B), P(B->C)].
*   **Statistical Modeling:** Employ a statistical model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model, Bayesian Network) to learn the distribution of Path Vectors. This creates a probabilistic representation of typical data flow patterns.

**3. Anomaly Detection & Prediction:**

*   **Anomaly Scoring:**  Calculate an anomaly score for each incoming data flow based on its deviation from the learned Path Vector distribution. Use metrics like Kullback-Leibler divergence or Jensen-Shannon divergence.
*   **Predictive Pathing:**  Based on current data flow and the learned probabilistic model, predict the most likely paths for future data.  This allows for proactive security measures and performance optimization.
*   **Thresholding & Alerting:** Define thresholds for anomaly scores. When a score exceeds the threshold, trigger alerts and initiate automated responses (e.g., blocking the traffic, triggering an investigation).

**4.  Implementation Details:**

*   **Graph Database:** Utilize a graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) to efficiently store and query network topology and path frequencies.
*   **Real-time Processing:** Implement a real-time processing pipeline (Kafka, Apache Flink) to ingest data, update path frequencies, and calculate anomaly scores.
*   **Machine Learning Framework:** Use a machine learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch) to train and deploy the probabilistic models.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detect_anomaly(data_flow):
  path = extract_path(data_flow)
  path_vector = calculate_path_vector(path)
  predicted_vector = model.predict(path_vector)  // Using trained probabilistic model
  anomaly_score = calculate_divergence(path_vector, predicted_vector)
  if anomaly_score > threshold:
    trigger_alert(anomaly_score, data_flow)
  return anomaly_score
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Intrusion Detection:** Identify unusual data flows that may indicate malicious activity.
*   **Data Loss Prevention:** Detect sensitive data being transmitted over unexpected paths.
*   **Network Performance Optimization:** Predict traffic patterns and optimize network resources.
*   **Application Behavior Analysis:** Understand how applications interact with the network.
