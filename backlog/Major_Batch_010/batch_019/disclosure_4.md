## Dynamic Package Attribute Weighting & Predictive Routing

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing camera/sensor infrastructure from the base patent. Addition of high-resolution depth sensors (Intel RealSense, LiDAR) integrated into camera arrays. Edge compute units (NVIDIA Jetson series) colocated with sensor arrays. Centralized server cluster for model training & management.
*   **Software:** Python-based framework utilizing PyTorch/TensorFlow for model development & deployment.  Database (PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension) for storing package attribute data, historical routing data, and sensor calibration data. Real-time data streaming pipeline (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for ingestion of sensor data.

**Innovation Description:**

The current system relies on a static vector space for package attributes. This limits adaptability to changing package characteristics (new products, seasonal variations, etc.). This system proposes a dynamic weighting system for vector attributes, combined with a predictive routing model.

1.  **Real-time Attribute Extraction & Weighting:**
    *   Depth sensors provide precise volume and shape data.
    *   Computer vision algorithms extract features (color histograms, texture, logos).
    *   OCR extracts text.
    *   A learned weighting model (implemented as a neural network) assigns a weight to each attribute *based on the current context*. This context is determined by factors like time of day, known incoming shipments, and recent routing efficiency data.  For example, during peak hours, weight might be heavily shifted towards dimensions and weight to optimize conveyor space. During slower periods, visual features (logo recognition) become more important for accurate categorization.
    *   The weighted attributes are combined to create the dynamic vector.

2.  **Predictive Routing Model:**
    *   A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units is trained on historical routing data (package attributes, routing path, delivery time).
    *   The RNN predicts the *optimal* routing path for the package *before* it reaches a major sorting point. This is based on the dynamic vector, current facility congestion, and predicted downstream demand.

3.  **Feedback Loop & Reinforcement Learning:**
    *   Actual routing performance (delivery time, resource usage) is fed back into the model.
    *   Reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization) are used to refine the weighting model and the routing predictions.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Real-time Data Acquisition
image = capture_image()
dimensions, weight = get_sensor_data()
text = extract_text(image)

# Feature Extraction
visual_features = extract_visual_features(image)
shape_features = calculate_shape_features(dimensions)

# Dynamic Weight Calculation
context = get_current_context() # Time, shipment schedule, congestion
weights = weight_model.predict(visual_features, shape_features, context)

# Dynamic Vector Creation
dynamic_vector = weights[0]*visual_features + weights[1]*shape_features + weights[2]*text

# Routing Prediction
predicted_path = routing_model.predict(dynamic_vector)

# Feedback Loop
actual_path = execute_routing(predicted_path)
reward = calculate_reward(actual_path)
routing_model.update(reward)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased routing efficiency.
*   Reduced congestion.
*   Improved scalability.
*   Adaptability to changing product mixes and demand patterns.
*   Proactive identification of potential routing bottlenecks.
