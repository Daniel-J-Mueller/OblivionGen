## Dynamic Merchant 'Health' Visualization & Predictive Capacity

**Concept:** Extend the ‘liveness’ and ‘suitability’ scoring beyond simple allocation. Create a real-time, interactive visualization of merchant ‘health’ – encompassing not just connectivity and performance, but *predicted* capacity based on current demand signals & external factors. This becomes a dynamic control panel for order flow.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Real-time ingestion of all existing data points (online/offline activity, connection quality, offer info, historical orders).
    *   Integration with external APIs:
        *   Weather data (impacts delivery times/demand)
        *   Local event schedules (concerts, sporting events – impacts demand/traffic)
        *   Traffic APIs (real-time congestion data)
        *   Social media trending topics (potential spikes in specific food types)
*   **'Health' Metric Calculation:**
    *   Develop a composite ‘Health’ score for each merchant. This is *not* a single number, but a multi-dimensional vector. Dimensions include:
        *   **Connectivity:** (Existing liveness score)
        *   **Performance:** (Existing performance quality score)
        *   **Capacity:**  (Calculated based on historical order fulfillment rate *adjusted* by current demand signals, traffic, weather, and estimated prep time).  This is the *novel* component.  Use a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict capacity.
        *   **Offer Competitiveness:** (Revenue share + any promotional offers)
        *   **Geographic Load:** (Density of active orders in the merchant's delivery zone). High density = lower capacity.
*   **Visualization Interface:**
    *   Interactive map-based dashboard. Each merchant represented as a node.
    *   Node color/size reflects overall ‘Health’ score (green = healthy, red = critical).
    *   Clicking a node reveals detailed metrics (all dimensions of the ‘Health’ vector).
    *   Time-slider to visualize ‘Health’ trends over time.
    *   Predictive overlay:  Show predicted order volume/demand in different areas of the map. Highlight merchants likely to become overloaded.
    *   Alerting system:  Notify operators when a merchant's ‘Health’ falls below a threshold.
*   **Dynamic Order Routing:**
    *   Algorithm to automatically route orders to the healthiest merchants *before* they become overloaded.
    *   Consider not just suitability score, but also *projected* capacity.
    *   Option for manual override by operators.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Order Routing):**

```
function routeOrder(order):
    eligibleMerchants = getEligibleMerchants(order.location)  //based on location & product type
    
    for merchant in eligibleMerchants:
        projectedLoad = predictMerchantLoad(merchant, order.time)
        suitabilityScore = calculateSuitabilityScore(merchant, order)
        healthScore = calculateHealthScore(merchant)

        weightedScore = (suitabilityScore * 0.6) + (healthScore * 0.4) - (projectedLoad * 0.2) //adjust weights as needed
        merchant.weightedScore = weightedScore

    bestMerchant = merchant.weightedScore.max()
    assignOrder(order, bestMerchant)
```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **Gamification:**  Provide merchants with tools to improve their ‘Health’ score and unlock benefits.
*   **Predictive Maintenance:**  Use data to predict when a merchant's equipment might fail (e.g., oven breakdown) and proactively schedule maintenance.
*   **Merchant Financing:** Offer merchants loans or other financial products based on their ‘Health’ score.
