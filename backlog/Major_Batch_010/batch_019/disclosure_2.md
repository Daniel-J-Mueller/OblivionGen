## Dynamic Knowledge Provenance & Trust Scoring

**Specification:** A system extension to the existing knowledge repository focused on tracking not just *what* knowledge is derived, but *how* confidently, and by what chain of reasoning. This moves beyond simple lineage to incorporate probabilistic trust.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Provenance Graph Enhancement:** The existing "related knowledge information" is expanded into a directed, weighted graph. Nodes represent knowledge facts. Edges represent inference steps (generators used). Edge weights represent a confidence score (0.0 - 1.0) assigned during inference.  This score considers the generator's historical accuracy, the quality of the input data, and any explicit uncertainty flags.

2.  **Trust Propagation Algorithm:**  A modified Bellman-Ford-like algorithm operates on the provenance graph. Starting from initial knowledge (ground truth, external sources), trust scores are propagated upwards through the graph.  The trust score of a derived fact is calculated as the minimum (or a weighted average) of the trust scores of its parent facts and the edge weight representing the inference step.  This provides a composite trust score for any fact in the repository.

3.  **Generator Profiling & Dynamic Weighting:** Each generator maintains a profile tracking its performance (accuracy, precision, recall) across different input data types. The system dynamically adjusts the edge weights associated with a generator based on this profile, favoring generators with high historical accuracy for similar inferences.  A ‘decay’ mechanism reduces weight over time for infrequently used generators.

4.  **Trust-Aware Querying:**  The query engine incorporates trust scores into its ranking algorithm. Results are prioritized based not only on relevance but also on the overall trust score of the knowledge used to generate them. Queries can also specify a minimum acceptable trust threshold.

5.  **"Explainability" Feature:** Users can request a complete "trust path" for any fact, revealing the entire chain of reasoning and the associated confidence scores at each step.  This enhances transparency and allows users to assess the reliability of the information.

**Pseudocode (Trust Propagation):**

```
function propagateTrust(knowledgeGraph, initialKnowledge):
  distances = {} // Trust scores for each node (fact)
  for node in knowledgeGraph.nodes:
    distances[node] = 0.0 // Initialize to 0.0

  for node in initialKnowledge:
    distances[node] = 1.0 // Initial trust is 1.0

  for _ in range(len(knowledgeGraph.nodes) - 1):
    for edge in knowledgeGraph.edges:
      u, v, weight = edge.source, edge.target, edge.weight
      if distances[u] > 0.0:
        distances[v] = max(distances[v], distances[u] * weight)

  return distances
```

**Potential Application:**  Critical decision-making systems (e.g., medical diagnosis, financial risk assessment) where understanding the reliability of the underlying knowledge is paramount.  Provides a mechanism for identifying and mitigating the risk of propagating incorrect or unreliable information. 

**Hardware/Software Considerations:** Graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) for efficient storage and traversal of the provenance graph.  Distributed computing framework (Spark, Flink) for scalable trust propagation.
