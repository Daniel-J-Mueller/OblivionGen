**Augmented Reality Workspace Projection & Interaction**

**Concept:** Extend the 'near-screen' interaction paradigm to project interactive workspaces *beyond* the physical device screen, anchoring them to real-world surfaces and objects. This moves beyond simply swapping layers of information *on* the screen to creating persistent, spatially aware augmented reality experiences triggered by proximity.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Depth Sensor: High-resolution depth sensor (LiDAR or structured light) integrated into the computing device to map the surrounding environment. Minimum range: 0.2m - 10m. Resolution: 1cm accuracy at 2m.
    *   Micro-Projector: Low-power, high-luminance micro-projector capable of projecting a visible image onto surfaces at varying distances (up to 2m). Resolution: 1280x720 minimum. Brightness: 50 lumens minimum.
    *   Ambient Light Sensor: To dynamically adjust projected brightness and contrast.
    *   Processing Unit: Dedicated processing unit (integrated or external) for real-time depth mapping, projection rendering, and interaction processing.
*   **Software:**
    *   Environment Mapping: Real-time 3D mapping of the surrounding environment using the depth sensor. Focus on plane detection (tables, walls, floors).
    *   Projection Rendering: Software engine capable of rendering 2D/3D content optimized for projection onto detected surfaces. Includes perspective correction and keystone adjustment.
    *   Interaction Engine:
        *   Proximity Trigger: Object detection (hand, stylus, etc.) within a defined range of the projection area activates the interaction engine.
        *   Gesture Recognition: Recognition of predefined gestures performed within the projection area (swipe, pinch, rotate).  Gesture library customizable via API.
        *   Surface Touch Simulation:  Algorithm to simulate touch input on the projected surface based on object proximity and gesture recognition.
        *   Haptic Feedback (Optional): Integration with haptic feedback devices (e.g., wristband) to provide tactile feedback for interactions.
    *   Workspace Management:
        *   Persistent Workspaces: Ability to save and restore projected workspaces.
        *   Workspace Anchoring:  Workspaces anchored to specific real-world objects or locations.
        *   Multi-Workspace Support:  Ability to create and manage multiple simultaneous workspaces.

**Pseudocode (Interaction Loop):**

```
// Initialize Depth Sensor, Projector, Interaction Engine

LOOP:
    depthData = GetDepthData()
    surfaceData = DetectSurfaces(depthData) //Identify planar surfaces

    objectData = DetectObjects(depthData)  //Hand, stylus, etc.

    IF objectData.isPresent:
        interactionData = ProcessInteraction(objectData, surfaceData)
        projectedContent = UpdateContent(interactionData, currentContent) //Rendered output

        Project(projectedContent, surfaceData)
    ELSE:
        Project(defaultContent, surfaceData)
END LOOP
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Virtual Workspaces:** Project a virtual monitor onto any surface, extending screen real estate.
*   **Interactive Data Visualization:** Project 3D models or charts onto a tabletop for collaborative analysis.
*   **AR Gaming:** Create immersive gaming experiences by projecting game elements onto the real-world environment.
*   **Remote Collaboration:** Allow remote participants to interact with a shared projected workspace.
