**Personalized Content 'Mood' Shifting**

**Concept:** Extend the time-based filtering to incorporate a 'mood' or 'energy' level associated with content, and dynamically shift recommendations based on detected user state. This builds on the idea of filtering based on *when* content was added to a watchlist, but adds *why* – inferred emotional state or desired activity level.

**Specs:**

*   **Content Metadata:** Expand content metadata to include tags representing 'mood' or 'energy level'. Examples: 'Relaxing', 'Uplifting', 'Action-Packed', 'Thought-Provoking', 'Low-Energy', 'High-Energy'. This tagging can be done through a combination of automated analysis (music tempo, scene brightness, dialogue analysis) and human curation.
*   **User State Detection:** Integrate with device sensors (accelerometer, microphone – for voice tone analysis, camera – for facial expression analysis) and/or user activity data (time of day, app usage patterns) to infer user state.
    *   **Mood Inference:**  A machine learning model (trained on sensor data and user feedback) will estimate user mood (e.g., ‘stressed’, ‘happy’, ‘bored’, ‘energetic’).
    *   **Activity Level Inference:** Determine if the user is likely engaged in a high-energy activity (e.g., exercising, cleaning) or a low-energy activity (e.g., relaxing, reading).
*   **Dynamic Recommendation Filtering/Weighting:**
    *   **Mood-Based Filtering:** If the user is detected as ‘stressed’, prioritize ‘Relaxing’ and ‘Uplifting’ content. If ‘energetic’, prioritize ‘Action-Packed’ or ‘High-Energy’ content.
    *   **Activity-Based Weighting:** During exercise, increase weighting for motivational or upbeat content. During relaxation, increase weighting for calming content.
    *   **Temporal Decay Adjustment:** The existing time-based filtering (from the original patent) will be *modulated* by the mood/activity level.  For example, if the user is in a ‘stressed’ state, the temporal decay for ‘Relaxing’ content is *reduced* – meaning older ‘Relaxing’ content is kept in the recommendation pool for longer.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Implement a feedback mechanism where users can explicitly rate the ‘appropriateness’ of recommendations based on their current state.  This data will be used to refine the machine learning models.
*   **Personalized Mood/Activity Profiles:**  Allow users to define preferred content types for different moods/activities.  (e.g., "When I'm stressed, I like documentaries.")

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION GenerateRecommendations(userID, currentContext):
    // currentContext contains:
    //  - User's browsing history
    //  - Watchlist
    //  - User's current Mood (inferred)
    //  - User's current Activity Level (inferred)

    candidateList = GenerateCandidateList(userID) // Includes watchlist items + new items

    // Filter/Weight based on User State
    FOR each item IN candidateList:
        item.weight = 1.0 // Default weight

        // Mood Adjustment
        IF currentContext.Mood == "Stressed":
            IF item.moodTag == "Relaxing":
                item.weight += 0.5
            ELSE:
                item.weight -= 0.2

        // Activity Adjustment
        IF currentContext.ActivityLevel == "HighEnergy":
            IF item.moodTag == "ActionPacked":
                item.weight += 0.4

        //Temporal Decay adjustment:
        timeSinceAdded = CalculateTimeSinceAddedToWatchlist(item)
        decayFactor = 1.0 - (timeSinceAdded / maxTime)
        item.weight *= decayFactor * (1 + MoodAdjustmentFactor) //MoodAdjustmentFactor is positive if Mood matches item and negative if it doesn't

    Sort(candidateList, by: item.weight, descending)

    Return TopN(candidateList)
```

*   `ContentItem`:  `title`, `genre`, `moodTag`, `energyLevel`, `timeAddedToWatchlist`
*   `UserContext`: `userID`, `mood`, `activityLevel`, `browsingHistory`, `watchlist`
