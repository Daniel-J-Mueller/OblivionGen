## Adaptive Certificate Trust Scoring & Dynamic Policy Enforcement

**Concept:** Extend automated certificate rotation with a dynamic trust scoring system and policy engine. Instead of simply replacing certificates, proactively assess certificate health, issuer reputation, and cryptographic agility.  Dynamically adjust application access policies based on this trust score, potentially limiting or denying access if the score falls below a threshold *before* a scheduled rotation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Trust Score Components:**

*   **Issuer Reputation:**  Integrate with threat intelligence feeds and Certificate Authority (CA) security reports. Assign a weight to CA reputation.
*   **Cryptographic Agility:** Evaluate the certificate's key exchange algorithm (RSA, ECDSA, etc.) and hash function. Assign higher scores to modern, stronger algorithms and lower scores to outdated/vulnerable ones.
*   **Certificate Chain Validation:**  Comprehensive validation of the entire certificate chain, including OCSP/CRL checks.  Failure to validate should drastically lower the score.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the certificate's domain (via DNS) for known vulnerabilities or compromised status (e.g., using VirusTotal API).
*   **Historical Data:** Track certificate performance over time (validation failures, revocation status). 

**2. Agent Modifications:**

*   **Trust Score Calculation:**  Agents on each host will calculate a trust score for all bound certificates. This calculation is configurable via a central policy engine.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Agents constantly monitor certificate health and update the trust score.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** Agents receive policies from the central engine specifying actions based on trust score thresholds (e.g., 'If score < 50, restrict access to sensitive data', 'If score < 20, deny all connections').
*   **Reporting:**  Agents report trust scores and policy enforcement actions to a central logging and analytics system.

**3. Central Policy Engine:**

*   **Policy Definition:**  A web-based interface allows administrators to define policies based on trust score thresholds, application criticality, and data sensitivity.
*   **Dynamic Policy Updates:** Policies can be updated in real-time and pushed to agents.
*   **Integration with Certificate Management Tool:** The engine receives rotation events from the certificate management tool.  Rotation events can *trigger* re-evaluation of trust scores for the *new* certificate *before* full deployment.
*   **Alerting:**  The engine generates alerts when trust scores fall below thresholds or policy violations occur.

**4. Pseudocode (Agent - Trust Score Calculation):**

```pseudocode
function calculateTrustScore(certificate):
  issuerReputation = getIssuerReputationScore(certificate.issuer)
  cryptoAgility = getCryptoAgilityScore(certificate.keyAlgorithm, certificate.hashFunction)
  validationStatus = validateCertificateChain(certificate) // Returns True/False
  vulnerabilityScan = scanCertificateDomainForVulnerabilities(certificate.domain) // Returns severity level (High, Medium, Low, None)

  score = (issuerReputation * 0.3) + (cryptoAgility * 0.2) + (validationStatus * 0.3) + (vulnerabilityScan * 0.2)

  return score
```

**5.  Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Machine Learning:** Use machine learning to predict certificate health based on historical data and threat intelligence.
*   **Automated Remediation:** Automatically trigger certificate revocation or rotation if a critical vulnerability is detected.
*   **Integration with Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems:**  Dynamically adjust user access based on certificate trust scores.
*   **'Canary' Deployment:** Test new certificates with a small subset of users before full deployment.
