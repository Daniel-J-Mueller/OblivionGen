## Dynamic Venue Personalization via Biometric Correlation

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Wearable biometric sensor (heart rate variability, galvanic skin response), smartphone with wireless communication capabilities, access to a cloud-based data store.
*   **Software:** Mobile application (iOS and Android), cloud-based data analytics engine, machine learning models.

**Innovation Description:**

The existing patent focuses on identifying a venue based on wireless signals. This builds upon that by *personalizing* the venue experience based on the user's biometric response *within* that venue. We move beyond simply *knowing* where the user is, to understanding how the user *feels* at that location, and adapting the environment accordingly.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Biometric Baseline:** Upon entering a previously unvisited venue (identified via the existing wireless fingerprinting system), the system initiates biometric data collection. A baseline is established over a short ‘calibration’ period (e.g., 30 seconds). This captures the user’s typical physiological state.

2.  **Real-time Biometric Analysis:** As the user interacts with the venue, biometric data is continuously collected and analyzed.  The system monitors for deviations from the established baseline. Significant deviations (positive or negative) indicate a strong emotional response to a specific aspect of the venue.

3.  **Venue Feature Mapping:** The system correlates biometric deviations with *venue features*. This is achieved via:
    *   **Sensor Data Integration:** Integration with venue-provided sensor data (e.g., lighting levels, temperature, sound levels).
    *   **Computer Vision:**  Analysis of the user’s gaze direction (via smartphone camera) to identify points of interest.
    *   **User Input:**  Optional user feedback (e.g., a quick rating of comfort level).

4.  **Dynamic Personalization:** Based on the correlation analysis, the system dynamically adjusts the venue experience to optimize the user’s emotional state. Examples:
    *   **Lighting Adjustment:** If the user shows signs of stress (increased heart rate), the system dims the lights.
    *   **Music Selection:** The system selects music known to evoke a calming effect.
    *   **Temperature Control:** The system adjusts the temperature based on user preference.
    *   **Proximity Notifications:** The system sends notifications about products or services the user may be interested in, based on their observed preferences.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
baseline_established = False
venue_features = []

// Upon entering new venue:
venue_id = DetectVenue() // Use existing patent logic
If venue_id != null:
    StartBiometricDataCollection()
    Set baseline_established = False

// Biometric Data Loop:
While (InVenue()):
    biometric_data = GetBiometricData()
    deviation = CalculateDeviation(biometric_data, baseline)
    If deviation > threshold AND baseline_established == False:
        baseline = biometric_data // Update baseline
        baseline_established = True
    If deviation > threshold:
        venue_feature = DetectVenueFeature(camera_data, sensor_data)
        AdjustVenueSettings(venue_feature, deviation) // E.g., dim lights
```

**Data Storage:**

*   User Profiles: Store biometric baselines and preference data.
*   Venue Feature Map: Store correlations between venue features and emotional responses.
*   Sensor Data: Store real-time sensor data from the venue.

**Scalability:**

The system is designed to be scalable by leveraging cloud-based data storage and processing.  Machine learning models can be continuously trained to improve the accuracy of emotional response prediction.
