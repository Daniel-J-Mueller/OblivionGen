## Dynamic Privacy Zones & Contextual Deletion

**Concept:** Extend the privacy mode beyond utterance-level deletion to encompass *contextual* data associated with a user's physical location and activity, creating dynamic privacy "zones" that automatically adjust deletion parameters based on detected environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of low-power microphones (integrated into device or external accessory) for ambient sound analysis.
    *   Device location services (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, Bluetooth beaconing).
    *   Optional: Camera for visual scene analysis (low resolution, privacy-focused – identifies broad categories like "home," "office," "public transport").
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Environmental Analyzer:** Continuously processes audio and location data (and optional visual data) to categorize the user’s current environment. Categories: "Private" (home, personal office), "Semi-Private" (coffee shop, co-working space), "Public" (street, train), "Sensitive" (medical facility, financial institution). This module employs a weighted scoring system, prioritizing audio cues (e.g., presence of other voices) and location data.
    *   **Privacy Zone Manager:** Defines privacy parameters for each environment category. Parameters include:
        *   *Data Retention Period:*  How long data is kept before automatic deletion (e.g., "Private" – indefinite; "Public" – immediate; "Semi-Private" – 24 hours).
        *   *Data Types to Delete:*  Specifies what data is subject to deletion (e.g., voice recordings, transcripts, usage logs, associated metadata).
        *   *Deletion Granularity:* Controls *what* gets deleted. Options: full deletion, anonymization (removing personally identifiable information), aggregation (combining data with others).
    *   **Contextual Deletion Engine:**  Based on the Privacy Zone Manager’s parameters, automatically deletes or anonymizes data associated with the user's current environment. Triggers deletion events at defined intervals or upon changes in environmental category.
    *   **User Override:**  Allows users to manually adjust privacy settings for specific environments or override automated deletion rules. Includes a “Panic Button” feature for immediate deletion of all sensitive data.

**Pseudocode (Contextual Deletion Engine):**

```
FUNCTION ProcessUtterance(utteranceData, utteranceID):
    currentEnvironment = GetCurrentEnvironment() // Uses Environmental Analyzer
    privacySettings = GetPrivacySettings(currentEnvironment) // Retrieves from Privacy Zone Manager
    retentionPeriod = privacySettings.retentionPeriod
    dataTypesToDelete = privacySettings.dataTypesToDelete

    IF utteranceData IN dataTypesToDelete:
        deletionTimestamp = CalculateDeletionTimestamp(retentionPeriod)
        IF NOW() > deletionTimestamp:
            DeleteData(utteranceData)
        ELSE:
            ScheduleDataDeletion(utteranceData, deletionTimestamp) // Use a task scheduler
```

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond simple utterance-level deletion to create a more nuanced and proactive privacy experience. By considering the user's environment, it can automatically adjust deletion parameters to balance usability with privacy. The integration of environmental analysis adds a layer of context-awareness that is missing from existing privacy modes.
