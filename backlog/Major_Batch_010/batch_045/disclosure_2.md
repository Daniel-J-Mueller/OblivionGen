## Dynamic Lock Granularity with Predictive Pre-emption

**Concept:** Extend the conditional write lock system to dynamically adjust lock granularity based on access patterns and predict potential contention, pre-emptively splitting or merging locks *before* contention occurs. This moves beyond simple acquisition/release to proactive lock management.

**Specifications:**

**1. Lock Granularity Profiles:**

*   **Data Structure:**  `LockProfile` object containing:
    *   `resourceID`: Unique identifier for the protected resource.
    *   `granularity`:  Integer representing lock granularity (1=coarse-grained, increasing value = finer-grained).  Base granularity defined at resource creation.
    *   `accessHistory`:  Time-series data tracking read/write access timestamps and originating compute node IDs.
    *   `contentionScore`:  Calculated metric (see section 3) representing predicted contention.
    *   `splitThreshold`: Contention score above which a split is triggered.
    *   `mergeThreshold`: Contention score below which a merge is triggered.
*   **Storage:** `LockProfile` objects maintained in a dedicated metadata store accessible to the key-value data store and compute nodes.

**2. Dynamic Split/Merge Operations:**

*   **Split:**  A coarse-grained lock is divided into multiple finer-grained locks, each protecting a sub-section of the resource. This is triggered when `contentionScore` > `splitThreshold`.
    *   Algorithm: Divide the resource into `n` equal partitions (configurable). Create `n` new `LockProfile` objects, each with a smaller `resourceID` space.  Update the metadata store.  Existing requests targeting the original resource ID are redirected to the appropriate sub-lock.
*   **Merge:** Multiple fine-grained locks are combined into a single coarse-grained lock.  Triggered when `contentionScore` < `mergeThreshold`.
    *   Algorithm: Identify adjacent fine-grained locks.  Combine their `resourceID` spaces.  Update the metadata store.  Redirect requests targeting the original fine-grained locks to the combined lock.

**3. Contention Score Calculation:**

*   Metric:  Based on access history data.
*   Algorithm:
    1.  Calculate the number of concurrent access requests (read + write) within a rolling time window (e.g., 5 seconds).
    2.  Calculate the standard deviation of request latency within the same time window.
    3.  `contentionScore` = (Number of Concurrent Requests) * (Standard Deviation of Latency).
    4.  Normalize the score to a manageable range (e.g., 0-100).

**4. Predictive Pre-emption:**

*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Each compute node periodically analyzes its own access patterns to protected resources.
    2.  If the node predicts an increase in access contention (based on historical data and anticipated workload), it sends a "pre-emption request" to the metadata store.
    3.  The metadata store evaluates the request and, if validated, initiates a split or merge operation *before* contention actually occurs.
    4.  The compute node receives confirmation of the operation and adjusts its locking strategy accordingly.

**5. Pseudocode (Compute Node – Pre-emption Request):**

```
function sendPreemptionRequest(resourceID, predictedAccessIncrease) {
  accessHistory = getAccessHistory(resourceID);
  if (predictedAccessIncrease > threshold) {
    request = {
      resourceID: resourceID,
      predictedAccessIncrease: predictedAccessIncrease,
      accessHistory: accessHistory
    };
    sendRequestToMetadataStore(request);
  }
}
```

**6. Pseudocode (Metadata Store – Handling Pre-emption Request):**

```
function handlePreemptionRequest(request) {
  resourceID = request.resourceID;
  predictedAccessIncrease = request.predictedAccessIncrease;
  accessHistory = request.accessHistory;

  contentionScore = calculateContentionScore(accessHistory);

  if (contentionScore > splitThreshold) {
    splitLock(resourceID);
  } else if (contentionScore < mergeThreshold) {
    mergeLock(resourceID);
  }
}
```

**Considerations:**

*   Overhead of split/merge operations must be minimized.
*   Metadata store must be highly available and scalable.
*   Lock granularity selection is crucial for performance.
*   Requires careful tuning of thresholds and parameters.
*   Potential for "thrashing" if split/merge operations are triggered too frequently.
