## Dynamic Service Bundling & Predictive Feature Adjustment

**Specification:** A system for proactively adjusting wireless service plan features *based on predicted usage patterns and network conditions*, going beyond simple feature addition/removal described in the base patent. This focuses on *dynamic* feature allocation, optimizing user experience and network resource utilization.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of a static service plan with a defined feature set, the system creates a 'fluid' plan where features are allocated and deallocated in near real-time, based on individual user behavior and network capacity.

**Components:**

1.  **Usage Prediction Engine:**  This module leverages machine learning to predict a user's future data, voice, and video usage based on historical data, location, time of day, app usage, and potentially even calendar events. 

2.  **Network Condition Monitor:**  Continuously monitors network performance (latency, bandwidth, congestion) in the user's current location.  This includes cell tower load and predicted interference.

3.  **Feature Allocation Manager:** This module is the core of the system. It receives predictions from the Usage Prediction Engine and Network Condition Monitor and dynamically adjusts feature allocation.  Features could include:
    *   **Video Quality:** Automatically adjust streaming video resolution (e.g., from 4K to 720p) based on network conditions and predicted data usage.
    *   **Data Prioritization:** Prioritize certain app traffic (e.g., video conferencing) over others (e.g., background app updates).
    *   **Hotspot Throttling:** Dynamically limit hotspot data speeds based on overall network load and user data caps.
    *   **VoLTE/5G Prioritization:** Switch between VoLTE/5G and 4G based on signal strength and network congestion.
    *   **Temporary Feature Grants:** Grant temporary access to features (e.g., international roaming) based on predicted travel plans.

4.  **User Interface:** A visual interface (within the carrier's app) that provides the user with transparency into the dynamic feature adjustments and allows for limited customization (e.g., a "prioritize video" setting).

**Pseudocode (Feature Allocation Manager):**

```
function allocateFeatures(user, currentTime):
  predictedUsage = UsagePredictionEngine.predictUsage(user, currentTime)
  networkConditions = NetworkConditionMonitor.getConditions(user)
  
  // Determine base feature set based on user's subscribed plan
  baseFeatures = UserPlan.getFeatures(user)

  adjustedFeatures = baseFeatures.copy()

  // Video Quality Adjustment
  if (predictedUsage.videoUsage > threshold && networkConditions.bandwidth < minimumBandwidth):
    adjustedFeatures.videoQuality = "720p" //Reduce quality
  else:
    adjustedFeatures.videoQuality = "Auto"

  // Data Prioritization
  if (predictedUsage.videoConference > threshold && networkConditions.latency > maxLatency):
    adjustedFeatures.prioritizeVideoConference = true
  else:
    adjustedFeatures.prioritizeVideoConference = false

  //Hotspot throttling based on data caps and network congestion
  if (predictedUsage.hotspotUsage > dataCap && networkConditions.congestion > threshold):
    adjustedFeatures.hotspotSpeed = throttledSpeed
  else:
    adjustedFeatures.hotspotSpeed = maxSpeed
  
  //Apply adjusted features to user's connection settings
  ConnectionManager.applyFeatures(user, adjustedFeatures)

  return adjustedFeatures
```

**Technical Considerations:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Requires a robust and scalable real-time data pipeline.
*   **Machine Learning Model Training:**  ML models must be continuously trained and updated to ensure accuracy.
*   **API Integration:**  Seamless integration with existing network infrastructure and billing systems.
*   **Security:**  Secure communication between all components to protect user data.
*   **User Privacy:** Transparent communication to the user regarding data collection and feature adjustments.
