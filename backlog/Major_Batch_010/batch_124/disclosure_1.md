**Dynamic Vulnerability 'Ecosystem' Modeling & Predictive Risk Scoring**

**Concept:** Expand beyond individual vulnerability chaining to model a dynamic 'ecosystem' of vulnerabilities, considering interdependencies, environmental factors (network topology, host role), and attacker behavior modeling to *predict* risk before exploitation occurs.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Vulnerability Graph Database:**
    *   Data Model:  Nodes represent vulnerabilities (CVEs, custom findings). Edges represent relationships (e.g., 'exploits-to', 'requires', 'mitigates').  Node attributes: CVSS score, exploit availability, patch status, affected systems, vulnerability type (as per patent - remote, privilege escalation, etc.). Edge attributes: confidence level of relationship, exploit chain length, potential impact.
    *   Data Sources: Integrate vulnerability feeds (NVD, commercial scanners), threat intelligence platforms, internal asset inventories, network configuration data.
    *   Graph Database Technology: Neo4j or similar.

2.  **Environmental Factor Integration:**
    *   Host Attributes: OS type, installed software, running services, network connectivity, security configurations (firewall rules, intrusion detection system status), data sensitivity.
    *   Network Topology: Map network segments, identify critical assets, visualize attack paths.
    *   API: Access network configuration and inventory management systems.

3.  **Attacker Behavior Modeling:**
    *   Markov Chain Modeling:  Train Markov chains on historical attack data (attack logs, threat intelligence reports) to model common attack sequences and probabilities.  States represent vulnerabilities or exploitation stages. Transitions represent exploitation actions.
    *   Reinforcement Learning:  Use reinforcement learning to simulate attacker behavior and identify optimal attack paths based on the vulnerability graph and environmental factors. Reward function: maximize impact, minimize detection probability.
    *   Simulation Engine:  Run simulations of potential attacks to assess the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies.

4.  **Predictive Risk Scoring:**
    *   Risk Metric:  Combine CVSS score, exploit availability, environmental factors, attacker behavior modeling results to calculate a 'Predictive Risk Score' (PRS) for each vulnerability and potential attack path. PRS should reflect the *likelihood* and *impact* of exploitation.
    *   Scoring Algorithm: Weighted sum of factors (weights determined through machine learning or expert input).  Include a 'confidence interval' to represent uncertainty in the prediction.
    *   PRS Visualization:  Interactive dashboard displaying PRS for vulnerabilities and attack paths.  Highlight critical vulnerabilities and potential attack paths.

5.  **Automated Mitigation Recommendations:**
    *   Remediation Prioritization:  Prioritize remediation efforts based on PRS, business impact, and cost of remediation.
    *   Automated Response Actions:  Integrate with security orchestration and automation platforms (SOAR) to automate mitigation actions (patching, firewall rule updates, system isolation).

**Pseudocode (PRS Calculation):**

```
function calculate_prs(vulnerability, environment, attacker_model):
    cvss_score = vulnerability.cvss_score
    exploit_availability = vulnerability.exploit_availability
    environmental_factor = environment.calculate_risk_multiplier()
    attacker_probability = attacker_model.calculate_attack_probability(vulnerability)

    prs = (cvss_score * exploit_availability * environmental_factor * attacker_probability)

    return prs
```

**Innovation Focus:**  Moving beyond reactive vulnerability chaining to a proactive, predictive risk assessment framework. The 'ecosystem' model allows for a more holistic view of security risks and enables more effective mitigation strategies.  This is a significant departure from the patent's focus on assessing risk *after* vulnerabilities are identified.
