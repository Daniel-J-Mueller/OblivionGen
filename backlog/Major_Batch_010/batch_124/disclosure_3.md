# D994938

## Adaptive Bioluminescence Flood Light

**Concept:** Replace traditional LEDs with genetically engineered bioluminescent bacteria encased in a transparent, nutrient-delivery matrix within the flood light housing. The light intensity and color temperature would be dynamically adjusted via control of bacterial metabolic rates (nutrient flow, oxygen levels, temperature).

**Specs:**

*   **Housing Material:** UV-resistant, optically clear acrylic or polycarbonate. Dimensions similar to existing D994938 flood light form factor. Modular design for easy matrix replacement/maintenance.
*   **Bacterial Strain:** *Aliivibrio fischeri* or similar, genetically modified for increased light output and controllable bioluminescence. Strain must be non-pathogenic and contained within the matrix.
*   **Nutrient Matrix:** Hydrogel-based, containing a slow-release nutrient blend optimized for bacterial growth and bioluminescence.  Matrix should be porous to allow for nutrient replenishment and waste removal.  Composition: 80% Water, 10% Agar, 5% Glycerol, 5% Nutrient salts (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Magnesium).
*   **Control System:**
    *   Microfluidic pump system: Precise delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the matrix. Flow rate adjustable via software interface.
    *   Temperature regulation: Peltier elements embedded within the housing to maintain optimal bacterial growth temperature (25-30Â°C).
    *   Oxygen sensor: Monitors oxygen levels within the housing. Adjusts air flow to maintain optimal levels.
    *   Light sensor: Measures light output to calibrate and maintain desired intensity.
    *   Microcontroller: Processes sensor data and controls pump, Peltier elements, and airflow.  Connectivity: WiFi/Bluetooth for remote control and monitoring.
*   **Power Supply:** Low-voltage DC power adapter.
*   **Light Distribution:** Diffusing layer integrated into the housing to evenly distribute bioluminescent light.
*   **Lifespan:**  Matrix designed for 6-month lifespan. Modular design allows for easy matrix replacement.
*   **Safety Features:**  Sealed housing to prevent bacterial escape. UV sterilization system to eliminate any stray bacteria.

**Pseudocode (Control System):**

```
// Initialization
connect to sensors (light, oxygen, temperature)
connect to actuators (pump, Peltier, airflow)
set initial parameters (target intensity, temperature)

loop:
    read light sensor
    read oxygen sensor
    read temperature sensor

    calculate error (difference between current intensity and target intensity)

    if error > threshold:
        adjust pump flow rate (increase for brighter light, decrease for dimmer light)
        adjust Peltier temperature (increase/decrease to optimize bacterial growth)
        adjust airflow (maintain optimal oxygen levels)
    end if

    log data (light intensity, oxygen levels, temperature)

    delay (1 second)
end loop
```

**Novelty:**

This design departs from traditional solid-state lighting by utilizing a biological light source. It offers potential advantages in terms of energy efficiency, sustainability, and unique aesthetic possibilities (e.g., pulsating or shifting light colors). The dynamic control of bacterial metabolism allows for adaptive lighting schemes that respond to environmental conditions or user preferences.
