## Dynamic Policy Sharding with Federated Attestation

**Concept:** Extend the remote user directory authentication concept to incorporate dynamic, sharded access policies, verified through a federated attestation network. This shifts from static permissions to granular, context-aware authorization enforced via a distributed trust system.

**Specification:**

**1. Policy Sharding & Distribution:**

*   Access control policies aren’t monolithic. They’re broken into micro-policies ("shards") based on contextual factors: time of day, device type, network location, user role *within a specific application*, data sensitivity level.
*   Each shard is cryptographically signed by the application/data owner.
*   Shards are stored in a distributed, content-addressable storage network (e.g., IPFS, Sia) – ensuring immutability and availability.
*   A "Policy Assembly Service" (PAS) orchestrates retrieval and assembly of applicable shards based on real-time context.  The PAS maintains a mapping between context attributes and shard identifiers.

**2. Federated Attestation Network:**

*   A network of independent "Attestation Nodes" (ANs) exists. These are trusted entities (potentially run by the service provider, subscriber, or even third parties).
*   Each AN maintains a "Trust Anchor" - a public key of a root of trust for a specific domain (e.g., a company's internal policy authority).
*   When a client requests access, the PAS sends a "Policy Request" to a subset of ANs.  This request includes:
    *   Client identity (from existing authentication flow).
    *   Contextual attributes.
    *   A hash of the assembled policy.
*   Each AN:
    *   Verifies the signatures on the policy shards using its Trust Anchor.
    *   Performs additional verification (e.g., ensures the policy doesn’t violate external regulations).
    *   Returns a digitally signed "Attestation Report" indicating success/failure and any reasons for failure.

**3. Access Decision & Enforcement:**

*   The PAS aggregates the Attestation Reports.  A threshold number of successful attestations is required for access to be granted.
*   The assembled policy (with verified signatures) is passed to a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP).
*   The PEP evaluates the policy against the client’s request and grants/denies access.

**Pseudocode (Policy Assembly Service):**

```
function assemblePolicy(clientID, contextAttributes):
  // 1. Retrieve shard identifiers based on context.
  shardIDs = lookupShardIDs(contextAttributes)

  // 2. Fetch shard content from distributed storage.
  shards = fetchShards(shardIDs)

  // 3. Verify shard signatures.
  for shard in shards:
    if not verifySignature(shard):
      return error("Invalid signature")

  // 4. Construct the assembled policy.
  assembledPolicy = combineShards(shards)

  // 5. Request Attestation Reports
  attestationReports = requestAttestation(assembledPolicy)

  // 6. Aggregate Attestation Reports and make decision.
  if aggregateReports(attestationReports) == success:
    return assembledPolicy
  else:
    return error("Access Denied")

function requestAttestation(policy):
  // Select a random subset of Attestation Nodes
  nodeSubset = selectAttestationNodes()
  // Send the policy to each node
  for node in nodeSubset:
    sendPolicyToNode(node, policy)
  // Collect the responses
  return collectResponses(nodeSubset)
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond simple access control lists. It allows for extremely fine-grained, dynamic authorization based on a distributed trust network.  It also creates a more resilient system, as a single point of failure won't compromise the entire authorization process.  The use of a federated attestation network helps prevent policy tampering and provides an audit trail for access decisions.
