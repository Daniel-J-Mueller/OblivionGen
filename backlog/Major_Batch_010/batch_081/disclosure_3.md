## Adaptive Address Space Partitioning with Dynamic Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the core address decoding concept to support dynamically reconfigurable address space partitions. Instead of fixed region sizes determined by hardware configuration, allow the decoding logic to adapt to varying region demands *during runtime*. This enables more efficient memory allocation and utilization, particularly in heterogeneous computing environments or systems with frequently changing workloads.

**Specifications:**

*   **Partition Control Unit (PCU):** A dedicated module that receives high-level memory allocation requests (e.g., from an OS or hypervisor).  These requests specify the desired size and type of memory region.
*   **Granularity Selection:** The PCU determines the optimal granularity for the requested region (e.g., 64KB, 1MB, 8MB, etc.).  This selection is based on a pre-defined set of granularities and factors like requested size, alignment requirements, and available resources.
*   **Dynamic Mask Generation:** The shifting hardware, as described in the source patent, is augmented with a programmable register bank.  This register bank stores multiple shift values corresponding to different granularities. The PCU selects the appropriate shift value based on the chosen granularity.
*   **Variable Window Size Input:**  The window size input to the shifting hardware is now dynamically controlled by the PCU, allowing it to adjust the size of the decoded region on the fly.
*   **Region Metadata Store:** A small, fast memory (e.g., SRAM) stores metadata associated with each dynamically allocated region. This metadata includes the base address, size, granularity, and ownership information.
*   **Parallel Decoding Support:** Multiple instances of the decoding logic operate in parallel, each responsible for decoding a different address space region.  This allows for high throughput and scalability.
*   **Security Considerations:** The PCU and Region Metadata Store are protected by access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modification of memory regions.

**Pseudocode (PCU):**

```
function AllocateRegion(size, alignment, region_type):
  granularity = SelectGranularity(size, alignment, region_type)
  base_address = FindAvailableMemory(size, alignment)
  shift_value = GetShiftValue(granularity) // Lookup in shift value table
  metadata = CreateMetadata(base_address, size, granularity)
  StoreMetadata(metadata)
  ConfigureDecoder(shift_value, base_address) // Update decoder hardware
  return base_address
end function

function SelectGranularity(size, alignment, region_type):
  // Logic to choose the optimal granularity based on size, alignment, and region type.
  // Could involve a lookup table or a more complex algorithm.
  if size < 64KB:
    return 64KB
  else if size < 1MB:
    return 1MB
  else:
    return 8MB
  end if
end function
```

**Hardware Extensions:**

*   **Programmable Register Bank:**  A small SRAM block stores multiple shift values for different granularities.
*   **Multiplexer Network:** Selects the appropriate shift value from the register bank based on the chosen granularity.
*   **Metadata Store Interface:** Allows the PCU to access and modify the region metadata.
*   **Decoder Configuration Interface:** Allows the PCU to program the base address and shift value of each decoder instance.
