## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Mapping for Video Summarization

**Concept:** Extend priority metric generation beyond purely visual/auditory features to incorporate inferred emotional responses from viewers, dynamically adjusting summary generation to maximize emotional impact.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Real-time Affective Sensing:**
    *   Integrate biofeedback sensors (EEG, GSR, heart rate) with viewing sessions.
    *   Implement facial expression analysis via webcam input.
    *   Utilize natural language processing (NLP) on real-time viewer commentary (if available - e.g. live streams with chat).
2.  **Emotional Feature Extraction:**
    *   Develop algorithms to extract quantifiable emotional features from sensor data, facial expressions, and text commentary.  Examples:
        *   *Valence:* Positive/Negative emotional tone.
        *   *Arousal:*  Intensity of emotional response.
        *   *Dominance:*  Feeling of control or submission.
        *   *Specific Emotion Detection:*  Algorithms to identify specific emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, etc.).
3.  **Dynamic Priority Metric Graph Construction:**
    *   Modify the existing priority metric graph to incorporate emotional features. 
    *   Weight emotional features based on their influence on overall summary effectiveness (configurable parameters).
    *   Calculate a ‘Resonance Score’ for each frame – combining visual/auditory priority with emotional response.
    *   The system can even dynamically adjust weights, making it adaptive.
4.  **Personalized Summarization:**
    *   Store emotional profiles for individual viewers.
    *   Tailor summary selection based on viewer-specific emotional responses. (e.g. prioritize moments that elicit strong positive emotions for a given viewer).
5.  **"Emotional Peak" Identification:**
    *   The system should identify ‘Emotional Peaks’ in the Resonance Score graph – moments where emotional response is highest.
    *   These peaks become primary candidates for inclusion in the summary.
6.  **Adaptive Summary Duration:**
    *   Allow the user to specify a desired summary duration *or* an emotional impact target (e.g., "create a summary that elicits a maximum positive emotional response").
    *   The system will dynamically adjust summary length to meet the specified criteria.
7.  **Summary Sequencing & "Emotional Flow":**
    *   Implement algorithms to ensure a coherent "emotional flow" within the summary.
    *   Prevent abrupt shifts between drastically different emotional states.
    *   Utilize transition effects that complement the emotional tone of the clips.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION GenerateEmotionalSummary(videoData, viewerData, desiredDuration)

    // 1. Extract Priority Metrics (Visual/Auditory - existing system)
    priorityGraph = CalculatePriorityGraph(videoData)

    // 2. Collect Viewer Data (Real-time during viewing or from profile)
    emotionalData = CollectEmotionalData(viewerData)

    // 3. Calculate Resonance Score for each frame
    FOR each frame IN videoData
        resonanceScore = (weightVisual * priorityGraph[frame]) + 
                         (weightEmotional * emotionalData[frame])
    END FOR

    // 4. Identify Emotional Peaks
    emotionalPeaks = FindPeaks(resonanceScore)

    // 5. Select Summary Clips based on Peaks and Duration
    selectedClips = []
    currentTime = 0
    FOR each peak IN emotionalPeaks
        clip = ExtractClipAroundPeak(peak, clipDuration)
        IF (currentTime + clipDuration <= desiredDuration)
            selectedClips.append(clip)
            currentTime += clipDuration
        END IF
    END FOR

    // 6. Sequence Clips for Emotional Flow
    orderedClips = OrderClipsForEmotionalFlow(selectedClips)

    // 7. Generate Output Video
    outputVideo = ConcatenateClips(orderedClips)

    RETURN outputVideo
