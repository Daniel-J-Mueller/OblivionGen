## Dynamic Micro-Preview Stitching with Generative Fill

**Concept:** Expand the micro-preview system by dynamically stitching together multiple short segments from *different* points within the full-length edited content (trailers, feature films, etc.), guided by user preference *and* generative AI fill to create a cohesive, extended micro-preview. 

**Specifications:**

**1. Segment Identification Module:**

*   **Input:** Full-length edited content (video file), User Preference Information (from existing system – learned preferences, genre, actors, etc.).
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilize a scene detection algorithm to break the edited content into discrete scenes.
    *   Employ a multi-layered scoring system to rank scenes based on:
        *   **User Preference Score:**  Scenes featuring preferred actors, directors, genres, etc., receive higher scores.
        *   **Action/Pacing Score:** Analyze visual and audio cues to determine the "energy" of a scene (fast cuts, loud music = higher score).
        *   **Visual Complexity Score:**  Measure the amount of visual information in a scene (number of objects, changes in camera angle, etc.).  This balances action with aesthetic appeal.
        *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Assess the emotional tone of a scene.
    *   Select the top N (e.g., 5-10) scenes based on the combined score.
*   **Output:** Ranked list of scenes suitable for inclusion in the dynamic micro-preview.

**2.  AI-Powered Transition Module:**

*   **Input:** Selected scenes, desired micro-preview duration (e.g., 15-30 seconds).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Scene Ordering:** Determine the optimal sequence of scenes.  Prioritize variety in action and emotional tone.
    *   **Transition Point Identification:** Identify natural transition points within and between scenes to minimize jarring cuts.
    *   **Generative Fill:**
        *   If gaps exist between scenes (due to desired duration or non-compatible cuts), utilize a generative AI model (diffusion model or similar) to create *seamless* fill content.
        *   The AI model is trained on a vast dataset of film footage to accurately extrapolate visuals and maintain stylistic consistency.
        *   Prompt the AI with contextual information from the adjacent scenes (setting, characters, mood) to generate appropriate fill content.
    *   **Audio Blending:**  Smoothly blend audio between scenes and generated fill content, adjusting volume and applying subtle sound effects as needed.
*   **Output:**  A stitched-together micro-preview with seamless transitions and blended audio.

**3.  Dynamic Adaptation Engine:**

*   **Input:** User interactions with the micro-preview (skips, pauses, requests for more information).
*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor user behavior to refine the scoring and generation algorithms in real-time.
    *   If a user consistently skips a certain type of scene, lower the weight of similar scenes in the scoring system.
    *   If a user pauses on a particular character or object, prioritize scenes featuring that element.
    *   Re-generate the micro-preview dynamically based on user feedback.
*   **Output:**  A personalized micro-preview experience tailored to the user’s preferences.

**Pseudocode (Key Section – Generative Fill):**

```
FUNCTION generate_fill(scene1_end, scene2_start, desired_duration):
  # Calculate the required fill duration
  fill_duration = desired_duration - duration(scene1_end to scene2_start)

  # Extract contextual information from adjacent scenes
  context = {
    "setting": extract_setting(scene1_end, scene2_start),
    "characters": extract_characters(scene1_end, scene2_start),
    "mood": analyze_mood(scene1_end, scene2_start)
  }

  # Generate fill content using AI model
  fill_content = ai_model.generate_video(
    duration=fill_duration,
    context=context
  )

  RETURN fill_content
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance GPU for AI model execution.
*   Sufficient RAM for video processing and AI model loading.
*   Fast storage for video files and generated content.
