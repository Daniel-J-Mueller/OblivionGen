## Adaptive Emotional Tone Modulation for Message Playback

**Concept:** Expand prioritization beyond simple urgency or sender to incorporate *emotional tone* analysis of incoming messages and dynamically adjust playback characteristics (speed, pitch, timbre) to match or counteract the detected emotion, enhancing user experience and potentially mitigating negative emotional impact.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Audio stream (speech) or text stream (messages)
*   **Processing Modules:**
    *   *Emotional Tone Analyzer:* AI module utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and/or Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) to identify the predominant emotional tone (joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutral, etc.) of the incoming message. Output is an emotional vector representing tone intensity and classification.
    *   *Playback Modulation Engine:*  Transforms the message’s audio characteristics (speed, pitch, timbre) based on the emotional vector. Modulations are not uniform; aim for ‘soothing’ or ‘energizing’ effects rather than direct mirroring.  Example: A highly negative message may have playback slowed and softened, while a positive message could be slightly accelerated and brightened.
    *   *User Profile Integration:* Stores user preferences for emotional modulation levels (e.g., “subtle,” “moderate,” “strong”). Also, includes a ‘bypass’ option for users who prefer raw message playback.
    *   *Contextual Awareness Module:* Integrates data from other sensors (e.g., user’s heart rate via wearable, ambient noise levels) to fine-tune the modulation.
*   **Output:**  Modulated audio stream delivered to the user’s output device (speakers, headphones).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function process_message(message_data, user_profile) {
    emotional_vector = analyze_emotion(message_data) // NLP/SER analysis
    modulation_level = user_profile.preferred_modulation_level
    contextual_data = get_contextual_data() //e.g., heart rate, ambient noise

    if (emotional_vector.is_negative() && modulation_level != "bypass") {
        playback_speed = original_speed * (1 - emotional_vector.negativity_score * 0.3) //Reduce speed based on negativity
        playback_pitch = original_pitch - emotional_vector.negativity_score * 50 //Lower pitch
        playback_timbre = soften_timbre(original_timbre, emotional_vector.negativity_score)
    } else if (emotional_vector.is_positive() && modulation_level != "bypass") {
        playback_speed = original_speed * (1 + emotional_vector.positivity_score * 0.2) //Increase speed
        playback_pitch = original_pitch + emotional_vector.positivity_score * 30 //Raise pitch
        playback_timbre = brighten_timbre(original_timbre, emotional_vector.positivity_score)
    } else {
        playback_speed = original_speed
        playback_pitch = original_pitch
        playback_timbre = original_timbre
    }

    modulated_audio = apply_modulations(original_audio, playback_speed, playback_pitch, playback_timbre)
    return modulated_audio
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard microphone/audio input
*   Sufficient processing power for real-time NLP/SER and audio manipulation
*   Audio output device
*   Optional: Integration with wearable sensors (heart rate monitor)

**Future Considerations:**

*   Personalized emotional modulation profiles learned through user feedback
*   Proactive emotional adaptation: Adjust playback based on predicted user emotional state.
*   Cross-modal integration: Synchronize emotional modulation with visual cues (e.g., screen color changes) for enhanced emotional signaling.
