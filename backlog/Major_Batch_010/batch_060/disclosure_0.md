## Dynamic Directory Shadowing & Predictive Access

**Concept:** Extend the authentication system to proactively "shadow" user activity across directories, building a predictive model of access needs. This allows pre-authorization of resources *before* a user explicitly requests them, significantly improving responsiveness and user experience, especially in complex, multi-directory environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** "Shadow Agent" - a lightweight process running on the user device and/or a trusted intermediary server.
*   **Data Collection:** The Shadow Agent passively monitors user interactions with directories – successful authentications, resource access patterns (files, applications, services), and time-based usage metrics.  All data is anonymized and aggregated to protect user privacy.
*   **Predictive Engine:** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) trained on the aggregated usage data.  This model predicts the probability of a user needing access to specific resources in different directories.
*   **Pre-Authorization Mechanism:** Based on the predictive model, the system proactively requests short-lived access tokens for resources the user is likely to need. These tokens are cached locally on the user device.
*   **Dynamic Token Refresh:** Tokens are automatically refreshed before expiration, ensuring seamless access.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The predictive model continuously learns from user behavior, improving accuracy over time.
*   **Policy Integration:**  Administrative policies define thresholds for predictive confidence. Only resources with a high probability of access are pre-authorized.
*    **Risk Scoring:**  Each predicted access is assigned a risk score based on the user’s role, the sensitivity of the resource, and the historical accuracy of the prediction. Higher risk accesses trigger additional verification steps (e.g., multi-factor authentication).

**Pseudocode (Shadow Agent – Simplified):**

```
// Initialization
user_id = get_user_id()
shadow_cache = {}

// Main Loop
while (running) {
  // Monitor User Activity (e.g., directory access attempts)
  activity = get_user_activity()

  if (activity) {
    // Update activity history
    update_activity_history(activity)

    // Predict future access needs
    predicted_access = predict_next_access(user_id, activity_history)

    // If prediction is confident enough & policy allows
    if (predicted_access.confidence > threshold) {
      // Request pre-authorization token
      token = request_preauth_token(predicted_access.resource, predicted_access.directory)

      // Cache the token
      shadow_cache[predicted_access.resource] = token
    }
  }

  // When user attempts access to a resource:
  if (access_request) {
    if (shadow_cache[access_request.resource]) {
      // Use cached token for seamless access
      access_granted(shadow_cache[access_request.resource])
    } else {
      // Normal authentication flow
      authenticate_user(access_request)
    }
  }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency for accessing resources.
*   Improved user experience.
*   Enhanced security through proactive authorization.
*   Scalability in complex, multi-directory environments.
*   Adaptive security posture based on user behavior.
