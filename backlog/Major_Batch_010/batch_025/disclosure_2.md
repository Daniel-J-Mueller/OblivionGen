## Personalized Application "Skill Trees" & Dynamic Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Leveraging application fingerprinting to create personalized "skill trees" for applications, allowing users to dynamically allocate resources (CPU, memory, network) based on *how* they use the application, optimizing performance and extending battery life.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Data Structures:**

*   `ApplicationProfile`: Contains the base application fingerprint (code fragments, device resources).
*   `UsageVector`: A multi-dimensional vector representing user interaction patterns. Dimensions include: feature usage frequency, session duration, resource consumption per feature, common task sequences, time of day usage, location-based usage, interaction type (touch, voice, etc.).
*   `SkillNode`: Represents a specific application function or feature. Contains: resource requirements (min/max CPU, memory, network), performance metrics, usage data contribution weight, associated `UsageVector` dimensions.
*   `SkillTree`: A directed acyclic graph of `SkillNode`s, representing the application's functionality.  Nodes are connected based on dependency.
*   `UserSkillTree`: Instance of `SkillTree` modified by user behavior.
*   `ResourceAllocationProfile`: Defines how resources are allocated to each `SkillNode` within the `UserSkillTree` based on current usage.

**2. System Components:**

*   `Fingerprint Analyzer`: (Existing from the patent) Generates initial `ApplicationProfile`.
*   `Usage Monitor`: Tracks user interaction with the application, generating `UsageVector` data. Runs continuously in the background.
*   `Skill Tree Builder`: Constructs the initial `SkillTree` based on application code analysis and documentation (if available). Prioritizes critical functions.
*   `User Skill Tree Adaptor`: Modifies the `SkillTree` based on `UsageVector` data.  Nodes are weighted higher if frequently used. New nodes can be dynamically added if the application supports extensibility (plugins, modules).
*   `Resource Allocator`: Dynamically adjusts resource allocation to `SkillNode`s within the `UserSkillTree` based on current usage and predefined priority levels.

**3. Algorithm (Resource Allocation):**

```pseudocode
// Input: UserSkillTree, ResourceAllocator, CurrentUsageVector
function allocateResources(UserSkillTree, ResourceAllocator, CurrentUsageVector):
  for each node in UserSkillTree:
    node.usageScore = calculateUsageScore(node, CurrentUsageVector) // Weighted sum of relevant UsageVector dimensions
    node.resourceRequest = calculateResourceRequest(node.usageScore, node.minResource, node.maxResource) // Scales resource request based on usage score.
  totalResourceRequest = sum of all node.resourceRequest
  availableResource = ResourceAllocator.getAvailableResource()

  if totalResourceRequest > availableResource:
    // Prioritize based on node.usageScore, and node.criticality
    sortedNodes = sort(nodes by descending usageScore and criticality)
    allocatedResource = 0
    for node in sortedNodes:
      if allocatedResource < availableResource:
        node.allocatedResource = min(node.resourceRequest, availableResource - allocatedResource)
        allocatedResource += node.allocatedResource
      else:
        node.allocatedResource = 0
  else:
    // Allocate requested resources to all nodes.
    for node in UserSkillTree:
        node.allocatedResource = node.resourceRequest
```

**4. Data Flow:**

1.  `Fingerprint Analyzer` generates `ApplicationProfile`.
2.  `Skill Tree Builder` creates initial `SkillTree`.
3.  `Usage Monitor` continuously collects `UsageVector` data.
4.  `User Skill Tree Adaptor` updates `UserSkillTree` based on `UsageVector`.
5.  `Resource Allocator` allocates resources to `SkillNode`s within `UserSkillTree` based on algorithm.
6.  System monitors performance and adjusts allocations dynamically.

**5.  User Interface (Optional):**

*   Visual representation of `UserSkillTree` showing resource allocation.
*   Ability to manually adjust resource priorities for specific features.
*   Performance metrics (FPS, CPU usage, battery life) correlated with resource allocation.

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simple application categorization and resource monitoring. It creates a dynamic, personalized resource management system that adapts to *how* the user interacts with the application, optimizing performance and efficiency.  It also opens opportunities for predictive resource allocation based on learned user behavior. The "skill tree" concept provides a visual and intuitive way for users to understand and control resource allocation.
