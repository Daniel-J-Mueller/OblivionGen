## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Predictive Audio Delivery

**Concept:** Leverage device microphone arrays and real-time acoustic environment mapping to not only *select* the best playback device, but to *reconstruct* the acoustic scene and pre-render/pre-fetch audio tailored to the user’s predicted movement *within* that scene.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Arrays:** All participating devices (phones, smart speakers, wearables) equipped with at least 4-microphone arrays. Arrays must support beamforming and sound source localization.
*   **Spatial Audio Rendering Engine:** Dedicated hardware acceleration for 3D audio rendering on each device (similar to current spatial audio implementations, but extended).
*   **Ultra-Wideband (UWB) or High-Precision Bluetooth:** For accurate, real-time device localization relative to each other and the environment.  Range > 10m, accuracy < 30cm.
*   **Edge Compute Capabilities:** Sufficient local processing power on each device for real-time acoustic analysis and scene reconstruction.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Mapper (ASM):** A distributed algorithm running on each device.  
    *   **Data Collection:** Each device continuously collects audio data from its microphone array.  UWB/Bluetooth provides position data.
    *   **Sound Source Localization:**  ASM uses beamforming and triangulation to identify and localize sound sources (speech, music, environmental noise).
    *   **Reverberation Mapping:** ASM estimates room acoustics (reverberation time, reflections) based on impulse response analysis.
    *   **Scene Graph Construction:**  ASM creates a dynamic 3D map of the acoustic environment, including sound source positions, room geometry, and acoustic properties.  This graph is distributed and collaboratively updated across all participating devices.
*   **Predictive Audio Engine (PAE):** Runs locally on each device, utilizing the ASM’s scene graph and user movement data.
    *   **User Tracking:** PAE tracks user head movements and position in real-time using device sensors.
    *   **Audio Projection:** PAE projects the desired audio onto the 3D scene graph, simulating how the sound would propagate in the environment.
    *   **Pre-Rendering/Pre-Fetching:** Based on predicted user movement (using Kalman filtering or similar techniques), PAE pre-renders or pre-fetches audio segments tailored to the user’s future listening position. This minimizes latency and ensures seamless audio transitions.
*   **Device Arbitration & Handoff Manager:** An enhanced version of the original patent's arbitration system.
    *   **Dynamic Device Selection:** Prioritizes devices based not only on audio quality but also on their position relative to the user, their ability to accurately render the audio for the current scene, and available processing power.
    *   **Seamless Handoff:** Smoothly transitions audio playback between devices as the user moves within the environment, avoiding dropouts or interruptions.  Utilizes crossfading and spatial audio manipulation to maintain a consistent listening experience.

**III. Pseudocode (PAE – Predictive Audio Engine):**

```
FUNCTION PreFetchAudio(UserPosition, PredictedMovement, SceneGraph, AudioSource)
    // 1. Calculate Optimal Playback Device
    BestDevice = DetermineBestDevice(UserPosition, SceneGraph)

    // 2. Calculate Audio Projection Parameters
    ProjectionParams = CalculateProjection(UserPosition, AudioSource, SceneGraph)

    // 3. Pre-Render Audio Segment
    PreRenderedSegment = RenderAudio(AudioSource, ProjectionParams)

    // 4. Pre-Fetch to BestDevice
    SendAudioToDevice(BestDevice, PreRenderedSegment)

    // 5. Update Prediction Model
    UpdateMovementPrediction(PredictedMovement)

RETURN PreRenderedSegment
```

**IV. Potential Applications:**

*   **Immersive Music Experiences:** Realistic spatial audio that adapts to the user's movement in a room.
*   **Enhanced Teleconferencing:**  Realistic voice localization for remote meetings.
*   **AR/VR Integration:**  Seamless audio rendering for augmented and virtual reality applications.
*   **Smart Home Audio Systems:**  Dynamic audio distribution that follows the user throughout the house.
