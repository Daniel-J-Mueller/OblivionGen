## Adaptive Semantic Fingerprinting for Dynamic Document Similarity

**System Overview:**

A system that creates evolving ‘semantic fingerprints’ for documents, going beyond simple token matching to capture nuanced meaning shifts over time. This builds on the token-based approach but layers in a dynamic knowledge graph and reinforcement learning to adaptively refine similarity scoring.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Dynamic Knowledge Graph (DKG):** 
    *   A continually updated graph built from the document corpus. 
    *   Nodes represent concepts (extracted via NLP - Named Entity Recognition, Topic Modeling).
    *   Edges represent semantic relationships between concepts (e.g., ‘is-a’, ‘part-of’, ‘related-to’).  Edge weights reflect the strength of the relationship, determined by co-occurrence frequency and contextual analysis.

2.  **Document Embedding Generation:**
    *   Utilizes transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) to generate contextual embeddings for each document.
    *   Embeddings are projected into the DKG's semantic space.  This aligns document meaning with the established knowledge representation.

3.  **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**
    *   An RL agent learns to refine the similarity scoring function.
    *   **State:** The state consists of the embeddings of two documents, the DKG's representation of their concepts, and initial similarity scores.
    *   **Action:** The agent can adjust weights within the similarity scoring function – weights for token overlap, semantic proximity in the DKG, and contextual similarity (calculated from transformer models).
    *   **Reward:**  Reward is derived from human feedback (e.g., a user labels document pairs as duplicates or not) and/or from the consistency of similarity rankings within the corpus.
    *   The agent is trained to maximize the accuracy of duplicate detection.

4.  **Similarity Scoring Engine:**
    *   Calculates similarity based on a weighted combination of:
        *   **Token Overlap:** Standard token-based similarity (TF-IDF, cosine similarity).
        *   **Semantic Proximity:**  Distance between document concepts within the DKG.  (e.g. shortest path distance, graph embedding similarity).
        *   **Contextual Similarity:** Similarity of contextual embeddings (from transformers).
        *   **RL-Adjusted Weights:** The weights for each component are dynamically adjusted by the RL agent.

**Pseudocode – Similarity Calculation:**

```
function calculate_similarity(doc1, doc2, DKG, RL_Agent):
    token_overlap = calculate_token_overlap(doc1, doc2)
    semantic_proximity = calculate_semantic_proximity(doc1, doc2, DKG)
    contextual_similarity = calculate_contextual_similarity(doc1, doc2)

    weights = RL_Agent.get_weights(doc1, doc2) #RL agent provides weights based on document characteristics

    similarity_score = (weights.token_overlap * token_overlap) + \
                       (weights.semantic_proximity * semantic_proximity) + \
                       (weights.contextual_similarity * contextual_similarity)

    return similarity_score
```

**System Workflow:**

1.  **Document Ingestion:** New documents are added to the corpus.
2.  **DKG Update:**  Concepts and relationships are extracted and added/updated in the DKG.
3.  **Embedding Generation:** Document embeddings are generated and projected into the DKG.
4.  **Similarity Calculation:**  When comparing documents, the similarity scoring engine calculates similarity using the dynamic weights.
5.  **RL Training:** The RL agent is continuously trained based on feedback and corpus consistency.



**Potential Applications:**

*   Improved duplicate detection in large document collections.
*   Adaptive search algorithms that understand semantic meaning.
*   Automatic knowledge graph construction and refinement.
*   Personalized document recommendations.
