## Dynamic Build Graph Generation & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the multi-container build system to dynamically generate a build graph *during* execution, and proactively allocate resources based on predicted graph complexity and container resource needs. This allows for optimization beyond static environment definitions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Build Graph Generator Module:**

*   **Input:** Software build task description (as in the patent), initial container instantiation, real-time container performance metrics (CPU, memory, I/O).
*   **Process:**
    *   Monitors container output (stdout, stderr, return codes).
    *   Uses a rule-based engine (or trained ML model) to identify dependencies and potential subsequent build steps implied by container output. Example: If a container compiles a library, the generator infers a need for linking or testing steps.
    *   Constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the build process. Nodes are build steps (containers/commands), edges represent dependencies.
    *   Updates the DAG in real-time as containers complete and provide new information.
*   **Output:** Dynamically updated build graph (DAG).

**2. Predictive Resource Allocator Module:**

*   **Input:** Dynamic build graph (DAG), container resource usage history, initial environment parameters.
*   **Process:**
    *   Estimates the resource requirements for each node in the DAG based on historical data and/or predictive modeling.
    *   Determines the optimal number of parallel containers to execute based on available resources and estimated build time.
    *   Proactively allocates resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) to upcoming containers.
    *   Scales resources up or down dynamically based on real-time performance and predicted needs.
*   **Output:** Resource allocation plan for upcoming containers.

**3. Integration with Existing System:**

*   The Build Graph Generator and Predictive Resource Allocator modules integrate with the existing software build management service (as described in the patent).
*   The build management service uses the dynamic build graph and resource allocation plan to schedule and execute containers.
*   Container instantiation and command execution remain largely the same, but are now guided by the dynamic resource allocation.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Resource Allocator):**

```pseudocode
function allocateResources(buildGraph, containerHistory, initialParams):
  resourcePlan = {}
  for each node in buildGraph:
    estimatedResourceUsage = predictResourceUsage(node, containerHistory)
    resourcePlan[node] = estimatedResourceUsage

  parallelism = calculateParallelism(resourcePlan, availableResources)

  scheduledContainers = []
  for each node in buildGraph:
    if node not in scheduledContainers:
      allocateResourcesToContainer(node, resourcePlan[node])
      scheduledContainers.append(node)

  return resourcePlan, scheduledContainers
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Build Graph:** DAG where nodes represent build steps (containers) and edges represent dependencies.
*   **Container History:** Database of container resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O) over time.
*   **Resource Plan:** Mapping of build steps to allocated resources.
