## Adaptive Quantum Relay Network with Mobile Entanglement Boosting

**Concept:** Expand the hybrid network concept to create a truly mobile, self-healing quantum network using a swarm of drone-based entanglement boosters, and adaptive routing protocols. This allows for entanglement distribution beyond line-of-sight limitations and dynamically adjusts to network disruptions.

**Specs:**

*   **Drone Units:**
    *   **Payload:** Miniature entangled photon source (EPR pair generation), single-photon detectors, quantum memory (e.g., based on atomic ensembles or solid-state qubits), RF communication module, GPS/IMU, high-precision attitude control.
    *   **Power:** Solar-assisted high-density batteries (minimum 30 minute flight time, optimized for low weight).
    *   **Size/Weight:** <500g, compact design for swarm operation.
    *   **Communication:** Secure RF link for inter-drone and ground station communication (control, status, routing).
*   **Ground Stations:**
    *   Enhanced optical ground stations (as in the base patent) with wider field-of-view for tracking multiple drones.
    *   High-performance computing cluster for network management and routing.
    *   Software-defined networking (SDN) controller for dynamic network configuration.
*   **Network Protocol:**
    *   **Entanglement Swapping Protocol:** Drones perform entanglement swapping to extend the range of entangled pairs.
    *   **Adaptive Routing:**  The SDN controller calculates optimal routes for entanglement distribution based on drone positions, link quality, and network congestion.
    *   **Dynamic Mesh Networking:** Drones form a self-healing mesh network, automatically rerouting entanglement around failed drones or blocked links.
    *   **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Integration:** Enables secure communication alongside entanglement distribution.
*   **Operation:**
    1.  A user requests entanglement distribution between two endpoints.
    2.  The SDN controller determines the optimal path through the drone swarm.
    3.  Drones along the path establish entangled pairs with their neighbors.
    4.  Entanglement swapping is performed to extend the entanglement to the destination endpoint.
    5.  Continuous monitoring of link quality and drone positions allows for dynamic route adjustments.

**Pseudocode (Routing Algorithm):**

```
function calculate_route(source, destination, drone_swarm):
  // Create a graph representing the network (drones as nodes, links as edges)
  graph = create_network_graph(drone_swarm)

  // Assign weights to edges based on link quality (signal strength, error rate)
  for each edge in graph:
    weight = calculate_link_quality(edge)
    edge.weight = weight

  // Use a shortest-path algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's) to find the optimal route
  route = shortest_path(graph, source, destination)

  return route

function shortest_path(graph, source, destination):
  // Implement Dijkstra's algorithm or similar
  // Calculate the shortest path from source to destination
  // Return the path as a list of drone IDs
  return path

function calculate_link_quality(edge):
  // Measure signal strength, error rate, and other relevant metrics
  // Calculate a quality score based on these metrics
  return quality_score
```

**Further Enhancements:**

*   **Drone-to-Drone Entanglement Distillation:** Improve entanglement fidelity through entanglement distillation protocols between drones.
*   **Autonomous Drone Replenishment:** Autonomous docking stations for drone battery swaps and maintenance.
*   **Multi-User Entanglement Sharing:** Enable multiple users to share the same entangled resource using time-division multiplexing or spatial multiplexing.
*   **Integration with Satellite Networks:** Combine drone-based networks with satellite links for global entanglement distribution.
