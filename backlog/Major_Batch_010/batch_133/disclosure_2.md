## Dynamic Skill Composition via Probabilistic Graph Networks

**Concept:** Extend the probabilistic skill selection to a dynamic composition of skills, modeled as a graph network where skill activations influence each other, and the final response is generated by a combined skill output. This moves beyond selecting *one* skill to orchestrating a collaborative skill set.

**Specification:**

1.  **Skill Graph Construction:** 
    *   Each skill is represented as a node in a graph.
    *   Edges between nodes represent learned relationships/dependencies between skills (e.g., skill A often preconditions skill B). Initial edge weights can be assigned based on co-occurrence during training.
    *   The graph structure can be pre-defined (based on domain knowledge) or learned dynamically during training.

2.  **Input Processing & Initial Skill Activation:**
    *   Input audio data is processed as in the original patent (speech recognition, BiLSTM encoding, character-sensitive/context-sensitive vectors).
    *   Each skill node receives the encoded input vector and calculates an initial activation probability (as in the original patent).

3.  **Message Passing & Graph Convolution:**
    *   A graph convolutional network (GCN) layer is applied to the skill graph.
    *   Each skill node aggregates activation probabilities from its neighboring nodes, weighted by the edge weights. 
    *   This allows skills to "influence" each other's activation levels. A skill might be initially low probability, but become highly activated if a related skill is strongly activated.
    *   Pseudocode:
        ```
        for each skill node 'i':
          neighbor_sum = 0
          for each neighbor 'j' of 'i':
            neighbor_sum += activation(skill_j) * edge_weight(i, j)
          updated_activation(skill_i) = sigmoid(initial_activation(skill_i) + neighbor_sum)
        ```

4.  **Combined Skill Output & Response Generation:**
    *   The final activation probabilities determine the contribution of each skill to the response.
    *   A weighted sum of the outputs from each skill generates the final response. The weights are based on the final activation probabilities.
    *   Alternatively, a separate “fusion” network (e.g., another small neural network) could learn to combine the skill outputs in a more complex way.

5.  **Training:**
    *   Training data should include examples where multiple skills are relevant to a single utterance.
    *   Loss function includes:
        *   Standard classification loss for skill activation probabilities.
        *   A regularization term to encourage sparsity in the skill graph (i.e., reduce unnecessary connections).
        *   A loss term that measures the quality of the final response.

6.  **System Components:**
    *   Speech Recognition Module (as in original patent).
    *   BiLSTM Encoding Modules (as in original patent).
    *   Skill Graph Module (implementation of the GCN and skill activation logic).
    *   Fusion Module (optional, for complex skill output combination).
    *   Response Generation Module (generates the final output based on the fused skill output).



**Innovation:** This approach allows for a more nuanced and flexible understanding of user intent by enabling *skill collaboration*.  Instead of simply selecting the *best* skill, the system can leverage the strengths of multiple skills to generate a more comprehensive and accurate response. It opens possibilities for complex task automation and contextual understanding. This is especially valuable for utterances with multiple sub-tasks or ambiguous intent.
