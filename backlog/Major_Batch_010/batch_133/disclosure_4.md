## Dynamic Reputation-Based Traffic Shaping

**Concept:** Extend the network protection service to incorporate a dynamic reputation system for incoming traffic *before* filtering or rerouting. This moves beyond simple threat detection (identifying *bad* traffic) to proactively prioritizing and shaping traffic based on assessed trustworthiness.

**Specs:**

*   **Reputation Score Calculation:**
    *   Each incoming connection (identified by source IP, port, and initial handshake data) is assigned a reputation score.
    *   Initial score: Neutral (e.g., 50/100).
    *   Score adjustments:
        *   Successful connections/data transfer: +1-5 points.
        *   Failed connections/timeouts: -1-3 points.
        *   Data transfer rate (consistent, moderate rates = +1, bursts/flooding = -2).
        *   Known "good" lists (e.g., whitelisted IPs, known services) = significant positive adjustment.
        *   Integration with threat intelligence feeds (known malicious IPs, botnets) = significant negative adjustment.
        *   Behavioral analysis (frequency of requests, type of requests, patterns) â€“ dynamic adjustments based on deviation from expected behavior.

*   **Traffic Shaping Implementation:**
    *   **Tiered Prioritization:** Traffic is assigned to one of three tiers based on reputation score:
        *   **High (75-100):**  Unrestricted access, highest priority.
        *   **Medium (50-74):**  Standard access, normal priority.
        *   **Low (0-49):**  Rate-limited, potentially delayed, subjected to stricter filtering.
    *   **Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation:** Each tier is allocated a percentage of available bandwidth.  Percentages are configurable and can be adjusted based on network conditions.
    *   **Queue Management:** Separate queues are maintained for each tier. This prevents low-reputation traffic from starving high-reputation traffic.

*   **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   Reputation assessment is performed *before* the traffic reaches the existing filtering and rerouting modules.
    *   Reputation score is passed as a metadata tag alongside the traffic.
    *   Existing filtering modules can utilize the reputation score to enhance their effectiveness. (e.g., apply stricter rules to low-reputation traffic).

*   **Adaptive Learning:**
    *   The system continuously learns and refines its reputation assessment based on observed network behavior.
    *   False positives/negatives are identified and used to adjust scoring algorithms.
    *   Anomaly detection: Sudden changes in reputation scores trigger alerts and further investigation.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Incoming Connection Handler

function handle_incoming_connection(connection_data):
  reputation_score = calculate_reputation(connection_data)

  if reputation_score >= 75:
    priority = "High"
  else if reputation_score >= 50:
    priority = "Medium"
  else:
    priority = "Low"

  connection_data.priority = priority

  // Enqueue connection based on priority
  enqueue_connection(connection_data)

  // Pass connection data to filtering/rerouting modules
  process_connection(connection_data)

function calculate_reputation(connection_data):
  // Initialize score
  score = 50

  // Check against known good/bad lists
  if connection_data.source_ip in whitelist:
    score += 20
  elif connection_data.source_ip in blacklist:
    score -= 30

  // Analyze connection behavior (rate, patterns)
  behavior_score = analyze_behavior(connection_data)
  score += behavior_score

  return score
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved network performance by prioritizing legitimate traffic.
*   Enhanced security by proactively identifying and mitigating malicious activity.
*   Reduced load on filtering and rerouting modules.
*   Adaptability to changing network conditions and threat landscapes.
