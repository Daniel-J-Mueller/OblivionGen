## Dynamic Category Weighting Based on User Gaze Tracking

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Eye-tracking peripheral integrated with display device (glasses-based or screen-integrated). Standard processing unit.
*   **Software:** Integration with recommendation engine UI. Gaze-tracking data processing module. Dynamic category weighting algorithm. UI modification module.

**Innovation Description:**

This system dynamically adjusts the weighting of item categories presented to the user in the recommendation interface based on where the user *looks*. The core principle is that sustained gaze on a category indicates increased interest, while avoidance suggests disinterest. 

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Gaze Data Collection:**  Continuously monitor user gaze position on the recommendation UI. Record gaze duration for each displayed item category.
2.  **Baseline Establishment:**  Upon initial UI load (or after a defined period of inactivity), establish a baseline gaze duration for each category. This baseline serves as a neutral starting point.
3.  **Weight Adjustment:**
    *   **Increased Interest:** If gaze duration on a category *exceeds* the baseline by a threshold (e.g., 50% longer), *increase* the category’s weight in the recommendation algorithm. This increases the likelihood of items from that category being surfaced.
    *   **Decreased Interest:** If gaze duration on a category *falls below* the baseline by a threshold, *decrease* the category’s weight.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment Rate:**  Implement a learning rate to control how quickly weights are adjusted.  A higher learning rate provides faster adaptation, but may lead to instability. A lower rate is more stable, but slower to respond.
4.  **Weight Capping:**  Establish minimum and maximum weight limits to prevent extreme weighting that could overly bias recommendations.
5.  **Decay Mechanism:** Implement a decay factor to gradually reduce category weights over time if the user’s gaze shifts away.  This prevents a single prolonged glance from permanently skewing recommendations.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Variables
categoryWeights[categoryID] = 1.0 //Initial weight for all categories
baselineGazeDuration[categoryID] = 0.0 //Store baseline duration
currentGazeDuration[categoryID] = 0.0 //Realtime Gaze Duration
weightAdjustmentRate = 0.05
minWeight = 0.1
maxWeight = 2.0
decayFactor = 0.98

//Realtime Loop

For each frame:
    For each category visible on screen:
        If user gaze is within category bounds:
            currentGazeDuration[categoryID] += frameTime
        Else:
            currentGazeDuration[categoryID] *= decayFactor //Decay if gaze is absent

    //Update weights
    For each category:
        If currentGazeDuration[categoryID] > baselineGazeDuration[categoryID] * 1.5:
            categoryWeights[categoryID] += weightAdjustmentRate
            categoryWeights[categoryID] = min(categoryWeights[categoryID], maxWeight)
        Else If currentGazeDuration[categoryID] < baselineGazeDuration[categoryID] * 0.5:
            categoryWeights[categoryID] -= weightAdjustmentRate
            categoryWeights[categoryID] = max(categoryWeights[categoryID], minWeight)

    //Apply categoryWeights to recommendation algorithm
```

**UI Modification:**

*   Optionally, visually highlight categories with increased weights to provide feedback to the user. (e.g., subtle color change, border effect).
*   Allow the user to reset category weights or disable gaze-based weighting entirely.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   More personalized and relevant recommendations.
*   Improved user experience through adaptive UI.
*   Discovery of user interests that may not be explicitly stated.
*   Passive data collection for more comprehensive user profiling.
