## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Identification for Portal Interaction

**Concept:** Utilize resonant frequency shifts in the portable device’s internal components (specifically, a miniature, calibrated oscillator) as an additional data layer for portal identification, supplementing or even replacing reliance solely on magnetometer data. This introduces a unique ‘signature’ for each portal beyond magnetic fields, enhancing security and accuracy, and allowing for operation in magnetically shielded environments.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Resonant Oscillator:** A MEMS-based, precisely calibrated oscillator integrated into the portable device. Operating frequency: 100 kHz – 1 MHz.  Frequency stability: ±1 Hz.  Tunable range: ±50 Hz via software control.
*   **Resonance Amplifier:** Low-noise amplifier to boost oscillator signal for accurate frequency measurement.
*   **Frequency Measurement Unit (FMU):** High-resolution frequency counter (resolution: 0.1 Hz) and digital signal processing (DSP) unit.
*   **Portal Resonators:** Each portal will contain multiple low-power, strategically positioned resonant elements (materials with specific resonant frequencies – could be simple tuned circuits or piezoelectric elements).  These will *not* actively transmit; they *respond* to the portable device’s probing signal. Operating frequency range: 100 kHz – 1 MHz (matching the portable device’s oscillator).
*   **Power Budget (Portable Device):** Resonant frequency probing should add no more than 5% to total device power consumption.
*   **Communication Interface:** Existing wireless communication interface (Bluetooth, etc.) used for initial portal handshake and data transmission.

**Software Specifications (Portable Device):**

1.  **Frequency Sweep:** Upon approaching a portal (indicated by beacon data or initial magnetometer reading), the device initiates a frequency sweep of its internal oscillator.
2.  **Resonance Detection:** The FMU monitors changes in oscillator amplitude and phase during the sweep. Significant amplitude increases or phase shifts indicate resonance with a portal element.
3.  **Resonance Mapping:**  A unique “resonance map” is generated, representing the frequencies at which resonance occurred and their corresponding amplitudes/phase shifts. This map serves as a portal identifier.
4.  **Data Transmission:** The resonance map, along with the device identifier, is transmitted to the portal.
5.  **Adaptive Tuning:** The system uses a moving average to filter background noise and refine the resonance map over time.

**Portal-Side Software:**

1.  **Resonance Map Database:**  The portal maintains a database of valid resonance maps.
2.  **Map Comparison:** The received resonance map is compared to the database.
3.  **Authentication:**  If a match is found, the device is authenticated.  A confidence score is assigned based on the similarity of the maps.
4.  **Account Association:** Once authenticated, the device identifier is used to access user account information.

**Pseudocode (Portable Device):**

```
// Initialization
calibrate_oscillator()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  if (beacon_detected() || magnetometer_threshold_exceeded()) {
    start_frequency_sweep()

    for (frequency = start_frequency; frequency <= end_frequency; frequency++) {
      set_oscillator_frequency(frequency)
      amplitude = measure_oscillator_amplitude()
      phase = measure_oscillator_phase()

      if (amplitude > threshold || phase > threshold) {
        record_resonance(frequency, amplitude, phase)
      }
    }
    generate_resonance_map()
    transmit_data(resonance_map, device_id)
  }
}
```

**Novelty & Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Significantly more difficult to spoof than magnetometer data alone.
*   **Operation in Shielded Environments:** Works even if magnetic fields are suppressed.
*   **Directional Identification:** Multiple resonators at a portal can provide directional information.
*   **Proximity Estimation:**  Resonance amplitude can indicate distance to the portal.
*   **Customizable Portal Signatures:** Resonance maps can be easily changed for security updates.
