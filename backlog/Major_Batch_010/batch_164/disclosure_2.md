## Dynamic Access Profiles via Biometric-Triggered Wireless Beaconing

**Concept:** Expand the wireless authentication concept to a dynamic access profile system, where user biometric data *actively* triggers beaconing from associated devices, establishing a localized and adaptive security perimeter. Instead of just *receiving* a signal for access, the system initiates a beaconing handshake, verifying proximity and biometric matching simultaneously.

**Specifications:**

**1. Device Roles:**

*   **Primary Device:** Portable device requiring access control (e.g., tablet, e-reader, secure workstation). Contains biometric scanner (fingerprint, facial recognition, iris scan).
*   **Associated Device(s):** External devices authorized to grant access (e.g., smartwatch, smartphone, dedicated security fob). Must support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beaconing and secure pairing.
*   **Network Component (Optional):** Secure network access point capable of verifying beaconing source and assisting in profile management.

**2. Enrollment & Profile Creation:**

*   User enrolls biometric data on the Primary Device.
*   User pairs Primary Device with one or more Associated Devices via secure Bluetooth pairing.
*   User defines *access profiles* associated with specific content or functionality on the Primary Device. Each profile links to one or more Associated Devices.
*   Profile metadata includes:
    *   Content/functionality access rights
    *   Associated Device priority (if multiple are linked)
    *   Proximity threshold (BLE RSSI value)
    *   Biometric matching confidence level required.

**3. Access Flow:**

1.  User attempts to access restricted content/functionality on the Primary Device.
2.  Primary Device prompts user for biometric authentication.
3.  Upon successful biometric scan *and* content access request, the Primary Device initiates a beacon request to all Associated Devices linked to the content's access profile.
4.  Associated Devices, upon receiving the request:
    *   Transmit a BLE beacon signal containing a unique identifier and a timestamp.
    *   Optionally perform a challenge-response sequence for increased security.
5.  Primary Device assesses received beacons:
    *   Verifies beacon source using pre-shared keys.
    *   Calculates Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to determine proximity.
    *   Confirms timestamp validity (prevents replay attacks).
6.  If proximity and verification pass, the Primary Device grants access based on the profileâ€™s defined rights.
7.  If multiple Associated Devices are linked, the Primary Device prioritizes based on profile settings (e.g., strongest signal, preferred device).

**4. Pseudocode (Primary Device - Access Flow):**

```pseudocode
function attemptAccess(contentID):
  biometricMatch = scanBiometrics()
  if not biometricMatch:
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  profile = getAccessProfile(contentID)
  if not profile:
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  associatedDevices = profile.associatedDevices

  beaconResponses = []
  for device in associatedDevices:
    requestBeacon(device) //Send beacon request

    response = waitForBeaconResponse(device, timeout)
    if response:
      beaconResponses.append(response)

  if beaconResponses.length == 0:
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  bestResponse = selectBestResponse(beaconResponses) // Prioritize based on RSSI/profile settings

  if verifyBeacon(bestResponse):
    grantAccess(contentID)
    return ACCESS_GRANTED
  else:
    return ACCESS_DENIED
```

**5. Enhanced Features:**

*   **Dynamic Proximity Adjustment:** Adjust proximity thresholds based on environmental context (e.g., tighter security in public spaces).
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Combine biometric authentication with PIN/password or secondary device verification.
*   **Time-Based Access:** Restrict access to specific content/functionality based on time of day or scheduled events.
*   **Geofencing Integration:** Limit access based on geographic location (e.g., only allow access within a defined home or office area).
*   **Emergency Override:** Allow access to critical content/functionality in emergency situations, even if biometric authentication fails.
