**Adaptive Snapshot Tiering with Predictive Pre-fetching**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:**

Implement a multi-tiered snapshot storage system that dynamically adjusts snapshot frequency and storage tier (SSD, NVMe, HDD, Tape) *based on predicted database workload and change patterns*.  This goes beyond simply choosing full vs. log-based snapshots – it anticipates *when* and *how* the database will change, proactively preparing snapshots for rapid restoration.

**II. Components:**

1.  **Workload Prediction Engine:**  A time-series forecasting model (LSTM or Transformer-based) trained on historical database metrics:
    *   Transaction rate (TPS)
    *   Query complexity (estimated execution cost)
    *   Data modification rate (inserts, updates, deletes per partition)
    *   Resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O)

2.  **Change Pattern Analyzer:**  Analyzes the *type* of changes occurring within each partition (e.g., bulk loads, random updates, deletions). This informs the snapshot strategy – for example, partitions undergoing frequent bulk loads might benefit from more frequent full snapshots, while those with mostly random updates might be well-served by log-based snapshots.

3.  **Tiered Storage Manager:**  Manages the movement of snapshots between storage tiers based on:
    *   *Predicted Restoration Time Objective (RTO):*  Critical partitions (high TPS, low latency requirements) are kept on faster tiers.
    *   *Snapshot Age:*  Older snapshots are automatically moved to cheaper, slower tiers (e.g., tape for long-term archival).
    *   *Change Volume:*  Partitions with a high volume of changes will be frequently snapshotted and kept on faster tiers.

4.  **Pre-fetcher:**  Based on the workload prediction, proactively pre-fetches snapshots *before* a restoration event is initiated. This significantly reduces RTO.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Continuous Monitoring:**  The system continuously monitors database metrics and change patterns.
2.  **Prediction & Analysis:** The Workload Prediction Engine and Change Pattern Analyzer generate predictions about future database behavior.
3.  **Snapshot Scheduling:** Based on the predictions, the Snapshot Scheduler determines:
    *   Snapshot Frequency (per partition)
    *   Snapshot Type (full, log-based, incremental)
    *   Storage Tier
4.  **Snapshot Creation:** Snapshots are created and stored in the appropriate tier.
5.  **Pre-fetching:** The Pre-fetcher proactively fetches likely required snapshots to faster tiers.
6.  **Restoration:**  When a restoration event is triggered, the system selects the most appropriate snapshot and restores the partition.

**IV. Pseudocode (Pre-fetcher Logic):**

```
function prefetch_snapshots(predicted_workload, partition_data):
  // Calculate probability of restoration event within a given timeframe
  restoration_probability = calculate_restoration_probability(predicted_workload)

  if restoration_probability > threshold:
    // Determine most likely snapshots based on predicted time range
    likely_snapshots = determine_likely_snapshots(predicted_workload, partition_data)

    for snapshot in likely_snapshots:
      if snapshot.storage_tier == "slow":
        // Move snapshot to faster tier
        move_snapshot_to_faster_tier(snapshot)
        log_event("Snapshot pre-fetched for partition: " + partition_data.name)
```

**V. Data Structures:**

*   `PartitionData`:  Contains metadata about each database partition (name, storage tier, change patterns, recent snapshots).
*   `Snapshot`:  Represents a snapshot of a partition (creation time, storage tier, snapshot type, data location).
*   `WorkloadPrediction`:  Stores predicted database metrics (TPS, query complexity, data modification rate).
