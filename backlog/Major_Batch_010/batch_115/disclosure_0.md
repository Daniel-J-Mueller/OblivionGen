## Dynamic Room Augmentation via Projected Light Fields

**Concept:** Extend 3D room modeling beyond static reconstruction to enable dynamic augmentation of the physical space with projected light fields, creating interactive and responsive environments. This builds upon the plane detection and mesh data processing in the provided patent, but moves towards *active* room modification rather than passive modeling.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution, wide-angle structured light scanner (similar to existing depth sensors, but capable of higher fidelity). This acts as both the modeling *and* projection source.
    *   Array of micro-projectors embedded within the scanner housing. These project light fields onto detected surfaces.
    *   High-performance onboard processor for real-time data processing and light field generation.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Real-time Plane & Mesh Reconstruction:** Utilize the provided patentâ€™s core functionality for accurate room mapping.
    *   **Semantic Segmentation:** Classify detected surfaces (walls, floor, furniture, etc.) to inform augmentation strategies.
    *   **Light Field Generation Engine:**  
        *   Accepts user-defined augmentation content (images, videos, 3D models, interactive elements).
        *   Dynamically generates light fields optimized for the detected surface geometry and viewing angle.  This includes handling occlusions and perspective correction.
        *   Supports layering and blending of multiple light fields.
    *   **Interactive Control System:**
        *   Gesture recognition (using scanner data) for intuitive control of augmentation content.
        *   Voice control integration.
        *   API for external control and integration with other smart home systems.
    *   **Dynamic Refinement Algorithm:** A system that continuously refines the light field projection based on changes in the room. This will require a method of comparing live data to modeled data, and applying correction.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
SCAN_ROOM()
CREATE_3D_MESH(scan_data)
IDENTIFY_PLANES(mesh_data)
CLASSIFY_SURFACES(planes)

// Main Loop
WHILE (true)
{
    CAPTURE_LIVE_SCAN()
    UPDATE_3D_MESH(live_scan_data, existing_mesh)
    DETECT_CHANGES(existing_mesh, updated_mesh) //Detect user interaction, object movement

    IF (changes_detected)
    {
        UPDATE_LIGHT_FIELDS(changes) //Adjust projection based on changes
    }

    GENERATE_LIGHT_FIELDS(user_content, classified_surfaces)
    PROJECT_LIGHT_FIELDS(light_fields, classified_surfaces)
}
```

**Augmentation Examples:**

*   **Virtual Furniture Placement:** Users can project realistic furniture models into the room to visualize potential arrangements *before* purchasing.
*   **Dynamic Wallpapers:** Replace static wallpapers with animated scenes or personalized displays.
*   **Interactive Learning:** Project educational games or information onto surfaces to create immersive learning experiences.
*   **Ambient Lighting Effects:** Create dynamic lighting schemes that respond to user mood or external events.
*   **Guided Assembly:** Project step-by-step instructions directly onto the assembly surface.
*   **Real-time Data Visualization:** Display live data feeds (weather, stock prices, etc.) onto surfaces.

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple static 3D models. By actively *modifying* the perceived environment with projected light fields, it creates a truly dynamic and responsive space. The system will adapt to the user's behavior and provide personalized experiences.  The key difference is moving from *representation* to *manipulation* of the room itself.
