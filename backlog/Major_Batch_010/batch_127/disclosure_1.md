## Adaptive Credential 'Echo' & Behavioral Forecasting

**Concept:** Expand the graceful expiration concept beyond simple access restriction. Instead of merely *reducing* access, implement a system where credential expiration triggers a phased ‘echo’ of the credential – a series of increasingly limited, time-boxed, and monitored ‘shadow’ credentials. Simultaneously, employ behavioral forecasting to *preemptively* offer mitigation paths.

**Specs:**

**I. Shadow Credential Generation & Phasing:**

*   **Phase 1 (Immediate Post-Expiration - 24hrs):** Generate a ‘read-only’ shadow credential mirroring the original, but with logging of *all* access attempts (successful & failed) tagged with ‘shadow access’. This allows for audit & identification of critical, ongoing needs. Scope limited to core resources.
*   **Phase 2 (24-72hrs):**  Shadow credential expands to allow ‘limited write’ access – specific, pre-defined actions only (e.g., updating contact info, confirming continued service use). Access requires a secondary confirmation step (e.g., SMS code, email link).  Monitoring intensifies, flagging anomalous behavior.
*   **Phase 3 (72-168hrs):**  ‘Emergency Access’ shadow credential.  Allows a single, critical action – triggered by user request & admin approval. Requires strong authentication & leaves a detailed audit trail.  Scope extremely limited.
*   **Phase 4 (168+hrs):** Credential fully revoked. Shadow access ceases. All activity is logged for forensic purposes.

**II. Behavioral Forecasting Engine:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Historical access patterns (pre-expiration).
    *   Real-time shadow credential access attempts.
    *   User-defined 'critical actions' (identified during initial credential setup – e.g., “I need to access payroll data weekly”).
    *   Resource criticality ratings.
    *   Sensor data indicating unusual access location/time.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   Time-series analysis to predict future access needs.
    *   Anomaly detection to identify deviations from established patterns.
    *   Rule-based system to flag potential disruptions.
*   **Mitigation Paths:**
    *   *Proactive* credential extension offers (if behavioral forecasting suggests ongoing need).
    *   Automated assistance for critical action completion.
    *   Automated escalation to support personnel.

**III. System Components:**

*   **Credential Management Service:** Handles credential lifecycle, shadow credential generation, and access control.
*   **Behavioral Forecasting Engine:** Analyzes data and generates predictions.
*   **Access Monitoring Service:** Logs and monitors all access attempts.
*   **User Interface:** Provides users with visibility into their credential status and available options.
*   **API Integrations:** Integrates with existing identity management systems.

**Pseudocode (Behavioral Forecasting):**

```
function predict_future_access(user_id, current_time, expiration_time) {
  historical_data = get_historical_access_data(user_id);
  critical_actions = get_user_critical_actions(user_id);
  
  // Time series analysis to predict future access frequency
  predicted_frequency = analyze_time_series(historical_data, current_time, expiration_time);
  
  // Identify critical actions that will be disrupted
  disrupted_actions = find_disrupted_actions(critical_actions, predicted_frequency);
  
  // Generate mitigation paths
  mitigation_paths = generate_mitigation_paths(disrupted_actions);
  
  return mitigation_paths;
}
```

**Novelty:** This isn't just about expiring access; it's about *understanding* how access is being used *as* it expires and providing alternatives. The ‘echo’ concept allows for graceful transition *and* data collection for improved security and usability. Behavioral forecasting moves beyond reactive mitigation to proactive assistance.
