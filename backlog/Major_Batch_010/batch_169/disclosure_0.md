## Automated Code Complexity Budgeting & Refactoring Suggestions

**Concept:** Extend the code review process to incorporate a dynamic "complexity budget" per module/function, proactively identifying and suggesting refactors *before* issues are flagged as bugs or maintainability concerns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Complexity Metric Integration:**

*   **Input:** Source code (any supported language).
*   **Process:** Calculate a suite of complexity metrics (Cyclomatic Complexity, Cognitive Complexity, Halstead metrics, lines of code, nesting depth).  Weight these metrics based on project-specific configuration or learned preferences.  This weighting allows customization for different code styles and project needs.
*   **Output:** A "Complexity Score" for each module/function.

**2. Dynamic Budget Definition:**

*   **Input:** Project configuration file or UI.
*   **Process:** Define a "Complexity Budget" for different code sections.  This can be based on:
    *   **Module Type:**  UI components might have a lower budget than backend data processing functions.
    *   **Criticality:** Core business logic might have a tighter budget than utility functions.
    *   **Historical Data:**  Learn from past project maintainability issues. Functions frequently refactored due to complexity would have lower budgets.
*   **Output:** Per-module/function Complexity Budget threshold.

**3. Real-time Analysis & Recommendation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Source Code, Complexity Scores, Complexity Budgets.
*   **Process:**
    *   Compare Complexity Scores against Budgets.
    *   If a function exceeds its budget, trigger a recommendation engine.
    *   The recommendation engine utilizes a library of refactoring patterns (Extract Method, Introduce Parameter Object, Replace Conditional with Polymorphism, etc.).
    *   AI-powered pattern selection:  A small machine learning model (trained on a large codebase) predicts the most effective refactoring pattern for the specific complexity profile and code structure.
    *   Generate a “Refactoring Cost” estimate (lines of code change, estimated developer time).
*   **Output:** A prioritized list of refactoring suggestions, including:
    *   Function Name
    *   Complexity Score
    *   Budget Limit
    *   Recommended Refactoring Pattern
    *   Refactoring Cost Estimate
    *   Code Snippet showing the potential refactoring (diff)

**4. Integration with Code Review System (Pull Requests):**

*   **Process:**
    *   The system runs automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline when a Pull Request is submitted.
    *   The analysis results are posted directly as comments on the Pull Request, flagging complex functions and suggesting refactors.
    *   Developers can accept or reject the suggestions.
    *   Data on accepted/rejected suggestions is used to refine the AI model and improve the accuracy of future recommendations.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function analyzeCode(sourceCode, projectConfig):
  complexityScores = calculateComplexity(sourceCode)
  complexityBudgets = loadBudgets(projectConfig)

  for function in complexityScores:
    if complexityScores[function] > complexityBudgets[function]:
      refactoringPattern = selectRefactoringPattern(function, complexityScores[function])
      refactoringCost = estimateCost(refactoringPattern, function)
      generateSuggestion(function, refactoringPattern, refactoringCost)

function selectRefactoringPattern(function, complexityScore):
  // ML model predicts best pattern based on complexity profile
  pattern = MLModel.predict(function, complexityScore)
  return pattern

function generateSuggestion(function, pattern, cost):
  // Post comment on Pull Request with suggestion and code snippet
  PRComment = createComment(function, pattern, cost)
  postComment(PRComment)
```
