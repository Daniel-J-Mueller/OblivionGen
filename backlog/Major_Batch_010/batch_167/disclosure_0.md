## Dynamic Skill-Based Call ‘Blending’ with Predictive Agent Fatigue

**Concept:** Expand the dynamic authority/skill granting system to *proactively* blend calls not just based on agent skill and call type, but also on *predicted* agent fatigue levels, preemptively adjusting call volume and complexity to maintain optimal performance and prevent burnout.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Modeling:**

*   **Physiological Data Integration:** Agents opt-in to wearable integration (smartwatch, headset sensors) collecting data like heart rate variability (HRV), skin conductance, blink rate, and voice tone analysis (stress detection).
*   **Behavioral Data:** Track agent metrics beyond performance – keyboard/mouse activity (typing speed, error rate), talk time, silence ratio, call handling patterns (transfer rates, hold times), and system usage (application switching frequency).
*   **Performance Data:**  Collect standard agent performance metrics (average handle time, resolution rate, customer satisfaction scores, etc.).
*   **Fatigue Model:**  Employ a machine learning model (Recurrent Neural Network preferred) trained on the combined physiological, behavioral, and performance data to predict individual agent fatigue levels in real-time. Model output: a “Fatigue Score” (0-100, higher = more fatigued).  Model must account for time of day, call volume, and prior call complexity.
*   **Call Complexity Scoring:** Implement a system that assigns a “Complexity Score” to incoming calls based on factors like reason for call, required systems access, expected resolution time, and customer history (e.g., prior complaints).

**II. Dynamic Blending Logic:**

*   **Real-Time Fatigue Adjustment:**  The system continuously monitors agent Fatigue Scores.
*   **Blending Thresholds:** Configure thresholds for Fatigue Scores.  Example:
    *   0-30: Normal – Agent receives calls based on skill and Complexity Score.
    *   31-60: Moderate – Agent receives fewer complex calls, potentially blended with simpler tasks (e.g., knowledge base article updates, script review).
    *   61-90: High – Agent receives only very simple calls or is temporarily removed from live call queues.  System prioritizes tasks requiring minimal cognitive effort.
    *   91-100: Critical – Agent is immediately removed from all queues and flagged for manager review.
*   **Proactive Queue Adjustment:** Based on predicted fatigue levels (using the model), the system proactively adjusts the distribution of incoming calls across the agent pool.  Higher-skilled agents with lower Fatigue Scores receive more complex calls.
*   **‘Micro-Breaks’ Automation:** When an agent's Fatigue Score exceeds a certain threshold, the system automatically inserts a short, pre-approved “micro-break” into their workflow (e.g., a guided meditation prompt, a quick stretching exercise, a suggestion to review a positive customer feedback snippet).
*   **Skill-Fatigue Matrix:** A matrix weighting agent skills against predicted fatigue. Prioritizes pairing low-fatigue agents with high-complexity calls, even if those agents don't *typically* handle those call types.

**III. System Architecture:**

*   **Data Pipeline:** Real-time data streams from wearable devices, call center systems, and agent desktop applications are ingested and processed by a data pipeline.
*   **Machine Learning Engine:**  The Fatigue Model and Skill-Fatigue Matrix are deployed and maintained by a machine learning engine.
*   **Blending Engine:**  The Blending Engine receives real-time data from the Machine Learning Engine and Call Center System, and dynamically adjusts call queues and agent assignments.
*   **Agent Desktop Integration:**  A visual indicator on the agent desktop displays their current Fatigue Score and any automated adjustments being made.



**Pseudocode (Simplified Blending Logic):**

```
// For each incoming call:
callComplexity = calculateCallComplexity(callDetails)

// For each available agent:
agentFatigue = getAgentFatigueScore(agentID)
agentSkill = getAgentSkillLevel(agentID, callType)

// Calculate blended score
blendedScore = (agentSkill * skillWeight) + (1 - (agentFatigue/100)) * fatigueWeight

// Select agent with highest blended score
selectedAgent = selectAgentWithHighestBlendedScore(availableAgents)

// Route call to selected agent
routeCall(callDetails, selectedAgent)

// Log performance metrics
logCallRoutingMetrics(callDetails, selectedAgent)
```
