## Adaptive Content Framing with Dynamic Peripheral Information

**Concept:** Extend the preview window functionality to dynamically integrate peripheral information *around* the preview window itself, related to the content being previewed. This is beyond just showing a page preview, aiming to deliver a 'contextual bubble' of relevant data.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Functionality: Dynamic Framing**

*   **Trigger:** User initiates a preview window (as described in the patent) – browse control, gesture, etc.
*   **Frame Creation:** Upon preview window initiation, the system analyzes the content of the ‘first page’ (the currently displayed page) *and* the ‘second page’ (the previewed page).
*   **Data Sources:** Access relevant data sources:
    *   **Internal:** Metadata associated with the electronic book (author, publication date, keywords, table of contents, linked references).
    *   **External:** Real-time web searches based on keywords extracted from both pages. News feeds related to the book's topic. Social media feeds (Twitter, Goodreads) discussing the book or author.
*   **Peripheral Display:** A dynamic, semi-transparent frame surrounds the preview window. This frame displays the data obtained from the data sources.
    *   **Data Presentation:**  Data is presented in concise 'cards' or 'widgets' within the frame. Examples:
        *   Author biography snippet.
        *   Key terms with definitions.
        *   Related news headlines.
        *   Quotes from reviews.
        *   Links to relevant web pages.
    *   **Dynamic Updates:** Data within the frame updates automatically based on user interaction (e.g., scrolling through the preview page) or real-time events.

**2. Interaction & Control**

*   **Hover/Tap Interaction:** User can hover (desktop) or tap (mobile) on a widget within the frame to expand it and view more detailed information.
*   **Customization:** User can customize the types of data displayed within the frame (e.g., disable social media feeds, prioritize news updates).
*   **Frame Opacity:** User can adjust the opacity of the frame to control the level of distraction.
*   **Frame Position:** Allow the user to reposition the frame around the preview window.

**3. System Architecture**

*   **Content Analysis Module:** Extracts keywords, metadata, and context from the displayed and previewed pages. Utilizes NLP techniques.
*   **Data Aggregation Module:** Queries internal and external data sources based on the extracted information.
*   **UI Rendering Module:** Renders the dynamic frame and displays the aggregated data.

**4. Pseudocode – Data Aggregation Module**

```
FUNCTION AggregateData(firstPageContent, secondPageContent):
  keywords = ExtractKeywords(firstPageContent + secondPageContent)
  metadata = GetBookMetadata()

  // Internal Data
  internalData = {
    "author": metadata.author,
    "publicationDate": metadata.publicationDate,
    "keywords": keywords
  }

  // External Data – Web Search
  webSearchURL = "https://example.com/search?q=" + keywords.join("+")
  webSearchResults = FetchWebSearchResults(webSearchURL)

  // External Data – Social Media
  socialMediaFeed = GetSocialMediaFeed(keywords)

  // Combine Data
  aggregatedData = {
    "internal": internalData,
    "web": webSearchResults,
    "social": socialMediaFeed
  }

  RETURN aggregatedData
```

**5. Potential Enhancements**

*   **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Use AI to recommend related books, articles, or topics based on the content being previewed.
*   **Cross-Lingual Support:** Translate content snippets in the frame to the user's preferred language.
*   **Augmented Reality Integration:** Project the dynamic frame onto a physical book using AR technology.
*   **Collaborative Framing:** Allow multiple users to contribute to the dynamic frame and share relevant information.
