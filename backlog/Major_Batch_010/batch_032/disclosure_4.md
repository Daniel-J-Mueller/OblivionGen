## Adaptive Key Rotation with Entropy Harvesting

**Concept:** Extend probabilistic key rotation by incorporating environmental entropy as a factor in key rotation decisions, enhancing security and potentially reducing reliance on computationally expensive random number generation.

**Specification:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Entropy Source:** A physical entropy source (e.g., atmospheric noise sensor, thermal noise generator, quantum random number generator) integrated into the system. This provides a stream of truly random data.
*   **Entropy Accumulator:** A dedicated hardware component that accumulates entropy bits from the entropy source.  This component should have buffering capabilities to handle varying entropy rates.
*   **Key Rotation Controller:** The core of the system. This component interfaces with the entropy accumulator, the counter (from the base patent), and the cryptographic key storage.
*   **Cryptographic Key Storage:**  Secure storage (HSM, secure enclave) for cryptographic keys.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Entropy Monitoring Service:** A background service that monitors the entropy accumulator's fill level and reports status.
*   **Key Rotation Policy Engine:** Configurable software that defines the key rotation policy, incorporating entropy thresholds and counter-based criteria.
*   **Key Management Service:** Standard key management functions (key generation, storage, retrieval, destruction).

**III. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Entropy Harvesting:** The entropy source continuously generates random data, which is accumulated in the entropy accumulator.

2.  **Counter Updates:**  As in the base patent, the counter is updated based on a stochastic process (e.g., a pseudorandom number generator).

3.  **Rotation Decision Logic:** The Key Rotation Policy Engine makes key rotation decisions based on a combination of:

    *   **Counter Value:**  The current value of the counter.
    *   **Entropy Level:**  The fill level of the entropy accumulator.  If the entropy accumulator exceeds a defined threshold, it biases the rotation decision towards *more frequent* key rotation. Conversely, if the entropy level is low, the system relies more heavily on the counter-based stochastic process.
    *   **Dynamic Weighting:** A weighting factor dynamically adjusts the influence of the counter and entropy level. This factor could be adaptive, learning from system usage patterns and security events.

4.  **Key Rotation:** When a key rotation is triggered, the Key Management Service replaces the old key with a new key.

**IV. Pseudocode â€“ Rotation Decision Logic:**

```
function determineKeyRotation(counterValue, entropyLevel, dynamicWeighting):

    // Calculate weighted contributions
    counterContribution = counterValue * (1 - dynamicWeighting)
    entropyContribution = entropyLevel * dynamicWeighting

    // Combine contributions
    combinedValue = counterContribution + entropyContribution

    // Define rotation threshold (tunable parameter)
    rotationThreshold = 100 // example value

    // Trigger rotation if combined value exceeds threshold
    if combinedValue > rotationThreshold:
        return TRUE // Rotate key
    else:
        return FALSE // Do not rotate key
```

**V.  System Configuration Parameters:**

*   `entropySourceType`:  Specifies the type of entropy source.
*   `entropyAccumulatorCapacity`:  The maximum number of entropy bits the accumulator can hold.
*   `rotationThreshold`: The threshold for triggering key rotation.
*   `dynamicWeightingFactor`: Controls the relative influence of entropy and the counter.
*   `entropySamplingRate`: Frequency with which entropy levels are sampled.

**VI. Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Incorporating true randomness from the environment can improve the unpredictability of key rotation, increasing resistance to attacks.
*   **Reduced Reliance on PRNG:** Less reliance on potentially compromised pseudorandom number generators.
*   **Adaptive Security:** The system can adapt its key rotation frequency based on environmental conditions and security threats.
*   **Compliance:** May help meet compliance requirements for high-security applications.
