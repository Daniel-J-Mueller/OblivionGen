## Secure Key Shard Distribution via Dynamic Network Topology

**Concept:** Expand the secure module concept to encompass a distributed key management system where the full key *never* exists on a single module. Instead, cryptographic shares of the key are distributed across a dynamically forming network of security modules. This network topology adapts in real-time based on trust relationships, proximity, and available bandwidth, ensuring resilience against compromise and providing enhanced performance.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Key Shard Generation:**
    *   Employ Shamir’s Secret Sharing (or similar) to divide the customer key into *n* shares.
    *   Each security module receives one or more shares. The number of shares a module receives is dynamically adjusted.
    *   Share generation occurs during key creation or key rotation.

2.  **Dynamic Network Formation:**
    *   Security modules broadcast “trust beacons” containing cryptographic attestations of their identity and security posture (e.g., attested boot state, firmware version).
    *   A “Network Coordinator” (potentially a dedicated service or a rotating role among the modules) maintains a trust graph based on these beacons.
    *   When a cryptographic operation is requested, the Coordinator identifies a minimal subset of modules holding shares sufficient for key reconstruction, prioritizing:
        *   Proximity (latency).
        *   Trust score (based on beacon data).
        *   Available bandwidth.
    *   A temporary, secure communication channel (e.g., TLS with mutual authentication) is established between the selected modules.

3.  **Secure Key Reconstruction:**
    *   Each selected module contributes its share to a distributed key reconstruction algorithm (e.g., Lagrange interpolation) executed via secure multi-party computation (MPC).
    *   The reconstructed key *never* leaves the MPC environment. Only the cryptographic operation is performed using the reconstructed key.
    *   The MPC execution results in the operation result, which is returned to the requesting system.

4.  **Trust Management:**
    *   Continuous monitoring of security module health and behavior.
    *   Detection of compromised or malicious modules.
    *   Automated removal of compromised modules from the network and redistribution of key shares.
    *   Adaptive trust scoring based on observed behavior.

5.  **Hardware & Software Components:**
    *   Security Modules: As described in the original patent, equipped with secure storage and processing capabilities.
    *   Network Coordinator: A software service running on a dedicated server or distributed across multiple security modules.
    *   Secure Communication Channel: TLS 1.3 or higher with mutual authentication and perfect forward secrecy.
    *   MPC Library: A high-performance MPC library optimized for security module hardware.
    *   Trust Beacon Protocol: A standardized protocol for exchanging trust information between security modules.

**Pseudocode (Network Coordinator - Key Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructKey(request, customerID):
  shares = []
  eligibleModules = findEligibleModules(customerID) // Based on proximity, trust, bandwidth
  
  for module in eligibleModules:
    share = module.getShare(customerID)
    shares.append(share)

  if len(shares) < threshold:
    return ERROR // Not enough shares

  reconstructedKey = performMPC(shares) // Using secure multi-party computation

  return reconstructedKey
```

**Novelty:** This design departs from centralized key management or static share distribution. The dynamic network topology offers superior resilience, performance, and scalability. The combination of proximity-based selection, trust management, and MPC ensures both security and efficiency. It effectively distributes trust and risk across a wider network, minimizing the impact of individual module compromise.
