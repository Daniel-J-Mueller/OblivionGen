## Dynamic Route Attenuation via Predictive Network Congestion

**Concept:** Extend the tag-based route control by incorporating *predictive* network congestion data into tag value assignments. Instead of just indicating scope, tags dynamically reflect predicted load, allowing client networks to prioritize routes based on *real-time* and *forecasted* network health.

**Specs:**

**1. Congestion Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time network telemetry (link utilization, latency, packet loss) from provider network infrastructure. Historical traffic patterns.  Client network traffic profiles (if available – opt-in).
*   **Processing:** Utilize time-series forecasting algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict network congestion levels for specific paths and regions within the provider network. Prediction horizon: 5-30 minutes.
*   **Output:**  A “Congestion Score” (0-100) for each network segment and region, representing the predicted likelihood of congestion.

**2. Tag Value Assignment Algorithm:**

*   **Baseline:** Existing route tagging schema (as outlined in the provided patent).
*   **Dynamic Component:**  Augment existing tag values with the Congestion Score.  This can be implemented via a bitwise operation or a separate tag field. Example: 
    *   Original Tag:  0x12 (Scope = Regional)
    *   Congestion Score: 75
    *   Final Tag: 0x12 | (75 << 8)  (assuming 8 bits allocated for congestion)

**3. Client-Side Route Evaluation Logic:**

*   **Tag Parsing:** Client routers extract both scope and congestion values from incoming route tags.
*   **Prioritization Policy:**  Client networks configure policies based on congestion scores. Examples:
    *   Routes with Congestion Score > 80:  Deprioritize or throttle.
    *   Routes with Congestion Score < 30:  Prioritize.
    *   Dynamic path selection based on combined scope and congestion.
*   **Feedback Loop:** (Optional) Client network can report observed congestion levels back to the provider network to refine prediction models.

**4. Implementation Details:**

*   **BGP Extension:** Utilize existing BGP Community attributes to carry the dynamic congestion information.
*   **API Integration:** Expose APIs to allow client networks to query congestion predictions for specific routes.
*   **Scalability:**  The Congestion Prediction Module must be designed to handle high volumes of network telemetry and route updates. Utilize distributed processing and caching.

**Pseudocode (Client Router):**

```
function process_bgp_update(update):
  route = update.route
  tag = update.tag

  scope = extract_scope_from_tag(tag)
  congestion_score = extract_congestion_score_from_tag(tag)

  if congestion_score > 80:
    route.priority = LOW
  elif congestion_score < 30:
    route.priority = HIGH
  else:
    route.priority = DEFAULT

  if route.priority == HIGH and scope == regional:
    # Prefer regional routes with low congestion
    install_route(route, preference = HIGH)
  else:
    install_route(route, preference = DEFAULT)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved network performance and resilience.
*   Enhanced quality of experience for client applications.
*   Proactive congestion avoidance.
*   More efficient utilization of network resources.
*   Greater control and visibility for client networks.
