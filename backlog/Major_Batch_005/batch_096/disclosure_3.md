**Secure, Decentralized Data Sharding with Attestation & Dynamic Key Management**

**Concept:** Extend the shippable storage device paradigm into a fully decentralized, auditable data sharding system. Instead of solely relying on the service provider's infrastructure, leverage a distributed network (e.g., a blockchain or similar DLT) for key management, shard storage, and data reconstruction verification.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Shard Creation & Encryption:**
    *   Data is split into multiple shards on the *client* side.
    *   Each shard is encrypted using a unique, randomly generated key (Shard Key).
    *   Shard Keys are *not* directly sent to the service provider.

2.  **Distributed Key Management (DKM):**
    *   A root key (RootKey) is generated and securely stored by the client (e.g., in a Hardware Security Module - HSM, or a secure enclave).
    *   The RootKey is used to encrypt a Key Encryption Key (KEK).
    *   The KEK is split into *n* shares using Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing.
    *   Each share is sent to a different, trusted node in the distributed network.
    *   A threshold *t* (where *t* <= *n*) is defined.  *t* shares are required to reconstruct the KEK.

3.  **Shippable Storage Device Role:**
    *   The shippable storage device *only* contains the *encrypted* shards.
    *   It also contains metadata:
        *   Shard IDs
        *   Addresses of the trusted nodes holding KEK shares
        *   Threshold *t*
        *   A cryptographic commitment to the RootKey (used for attestation)
        *   A Merkle tree root hash representing the full data file, for integrity validation.

4.  **Service Provider Workflow:**
    *   Receives the shippable device.
    *   Authenticates the device.
    *   Initiates a data reconstruction request.
    *   Contacts the trusted nodes to obtain KEK shares.  Nodes cryptographically prove ownership of shares.
    *   Reconstructs the KEK once *t* shares are received.
    *   Decrypts the Shard Keys using the KEK.
    *   Decrypts the shards using the Shard Keys.
    *   Verifies the integrity of the reconstructed file using the Merkle tree.
    *   Optionally, the service provider can prove to the client that data reconstruction succeeded without revealing the raw data. (Zero-Knowledge Proof).

5.  **Attestation & RootKey Verification:**
    *   The service provider, prior to decryption, can request attestation from the client via a trusted execution environment (TEE) on the client's machine.
    *   The client's TEE proves ownership of the RootKey via a cryptographic challenge-response mechanism utilizing the commitment on the shippable storage device.  This proves the client authorized the data transfer.
    *   This prevents unauthorized decryption of the shards if the device is intercepted.

6.  **Dynamic Key Rotation:**
    *   The system should support periodic key rotation. A new RootKey is generated, shares are redistributed, and the process repeats. This enhances security and mitigates the risk of compromised keys.

**Pseudocode (Data Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructData(device):
  // 1. Verify Device Authenticity
  if not verifyDevice(device):
    return error("Device authentication failed")

  // 2. Obtain KEK Shares
  shares = getKekShares(device.nodeAddresses)

  // 3. Reconstruct KEK
  kek = reconstructKek(shares, device.threshold)

  // 4. Decrypt Shard Keys
  shardKeys = decryptShardKeys(device.encryptedShardKeys, kek)

  // 5. Decrypt Shards
  shards = decryptShards(device.shards, shardKeys)

  // 6. Reconstruct File
  file = reconstructFile(shards)

  // 7. Verify Integrity (Merkle Tree)
  if not verifyFileIntegrity(file, device.merkleRoot):
    return error("File integrity check failed")

  return file
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Shippable storage device (SSD recommended)
*   Secure Enclaves (e.g., Intel SGX, AMD SEV) on both client and service provider machines for key protection and attestation.
*   Trusted network connectivity for key share distribution.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced Security: Decentralized key management reduces the risk of single points of failure.
*   Data Privacy: Client retains control over the encryption keys.
*   Auditable: The distributed nature of the system provides a clear audit trail.
*   Scalability: Can be adapted to handle large datasets.
*   Resilience: Decentralization improves system resilience to attacks.
