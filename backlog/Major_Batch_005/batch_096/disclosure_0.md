## Dynamic Certificate Trust Scoring via Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the fraud metric generation to include real-time behavioral biometrics of the representative requesting the certificate. This moves beyond static account history and incorporates *how* the request is made as a key trust indicator.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Input:** API request for a digital certificate.
*   **Function:** Capture granular user interaction data *during* the API request submission. This includes:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, error rate).
    *   Mouse movement patterns (speed, acceleration, trajectory).
    *   Scroll behavior (speed, patterns).
    *   API request timing (time between fields filled, overall submission time).
    *   Network characteristics (IP address geolocation consistency, connection type).
*   **Output:**  A feature vector representing behavioral characteristics of the requestor.

**2. Behavioral Profile Database:**

*   **Storage:** A database to store behavioral profiles for each representative.
*   **Data:**  Each profile includes:
    *   Historical behavioral data (collected over time).
    *   Statistical models representing typical behavior (mean, standard deviation, distributions).
    *   Anomaly detection thresholds (calculated per feature).

**3. Real-Time Anomaly Detection Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Feature vector from Data Acquisition Module, Behavioral Profile from Behavioral Profile Database.
*   **Function:**
    *   Calculate an anomaly score for each behavioral feature by comparing real-time data to the historical profile.
    *   Weight each anomaly score based on feature importance (determined through machine learning - see 'Training Module').
    *   Aggregate weighted anomaly scores into a single ‘Behavioral Trust Score’.
*   **Output:** Behavioral Trust Score (0-100, 100 being highest trust).

**4.  Combined Fraud Metric Generator:**

*   **Input:** Existing fraud metrics (from patent), Behavioral Trust Score.
*   **Function:** Combine existing and new scores using a weighted average. Weights are dynamically adjusted based on the confidence level of each metric.
*   **Output:**  Final Combined Fraud Score.

**5. Training Module:**

*   **Function:** Train machine learning models to:
    *   Determine optimal feature weights for anomaly detection.
    *   Dynamically adjust weights for combining fraud metrics.
    *   Identify patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior.
*   **Data Source:** Historical API request data, labeled with fraud outcomes.

**Pseudocode (Combined Fraud Metric Generator):**

```
function calculateCombinedFraudScore(existingFraudScore, behavioralTrustScore):
  // Dynamic Weight Adjustment
  existingScoreConfidence = calculateConfidence(existingFraudScore) //Based on data source reliability/age
  behavioralScoreConfidence = calculateConfidence(behavioralTrustScore) //Based on data volume/model accuracy

  // Normalize Confidences (0-1)
  normalizedExistingConfidence = normalize(existingScoreConfidence)
  normalizedBehavioralConfidence = normalize(behavioralScoreConfidence)

  // Weighted Average
  combinedScore = (normalizedExistingConfidence * existingFraudScore) + (normalizedBehavioralConfidence * (100 - behavioralTrustScore))

  return combinedScore
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   API Gateway capable of capturing granular request data.
*   Real-time data processing pipeline (e.g., Kafka, Spark Streaming).
*   Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Database for storing behavioral profiles.
*   Secure enclave for protecting sensitive behavioral data.
