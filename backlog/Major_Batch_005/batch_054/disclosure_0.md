## Adaptive Feature Weighting via Bayesian Optimization

**Concept:** Enhance the synthetic control method by dynamically adjusting the weights assigned to control sub-groups based on real-time prediction accuracy. The existing patent relies on a fixed weight determination. This adaptation introduces a feedback loop using Bayesian optimization to refine weighting schemes, increasing the precision of effect metric calculations.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Prediction Model:** Integrate a predictive model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) trained on historical data to forecast outcome metrics for the first deployment region *given* a specific set of control sub-group weights.  Input features: Control sub-group weights, historical data from both regions (prior to the intervention), and contextual variables (time of day, day of week, seasonality). Output: Predicted outcome metric for the first deployment region.

2.  **Bayesian Optimization Loop:**
    *   **Objective Function:**  Minimize the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the actual outcome metric in the first deployment region and the predicted outcome metric.
    *   **Search Space:** Define a search space for the weights assigned to each control sub-group. Constraints: Sum of weights = 1.  Each weight must be >= 0.
    *   **Acquisition Function:** Employ an acquisition function (e.g., Expected Improvement, Upper Confidence Bound) to guide the search for optimal weights.
    *   **Optimization Algorithm:** Utilize a Bayesian optimization algorithm (e.g., Gaussian Process optimization) to iteratively update the weights based on the observed RMSE.

3.  **Real-time Weight Adjustment:** Continuously (or at defined intervals) run the Bayesian optimization loop using incoming data. This will dynamically adjust the weights assigned to control sub-groups, adapting to changing conditions and improving the accuracy of the effect metric.

4.  **Data Pipeline:** Establish a streaming data pipeline to ingest historical and real-time data from both deployment regions. This pipeline must include data cleaning, feature engineering, and data transformation steps to ensure data quality and compatibility with the prediction model and optimization algorithm.

5.  **Infrastructure:** Deploy the system on a scalable cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) to handle the volume of data and computational demands of the prediction model and optimization algorithm.

**Pseudocode:**

```
# Initialize:
Historical_Data = Load_Historical_Data()
Prediction_Model = Train_Prediction_Model(Historical_Data)
Bayesian_Optimizer = Initialize_Bayesian_Optimizer()

# Real-time Loop:
while True:
    Realtime_Data = Load_Realtime_Data()
    
    # 1. Predict Outcome Metric:
    Predicted_Outcome = Prediction_Model.Predict(Realtime_Data, Current_Weights)
    
    # 2. Calculate Error:
    Error = RMSE(Predicted_Outcome, Actual_Outcome)
    
    # 3. Optimize Weights:
    New_Weights = Bayesian_Optimizer.Suggest(Error)
    Current_Weights = New_Weights
    
    # 4. Calculate Effect Metric using New Weights
    Effect_Metric = Calculate_Effect_Metric(New_Weights)
    
    # 5. Present Effect Metric (GUI)
    Present_GUI(Effect_Metric)
    
    Sleep(Interval)
```

**Innovation:** This enhances the static synthetic control approach with a dynamic, learning component, allowing it to adapt to non-stationary environments and improve the accuracy of effect metric calculations. This system will automatically 'learn' which control groups are best to compare against, based on real-time data.
