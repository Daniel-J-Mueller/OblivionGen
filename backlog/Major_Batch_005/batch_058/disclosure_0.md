## Adaptive Acoustic Zones & Intent Mapping

**Concept:** Implement spatially-aware voice command processing. The device creates and dynamically adjusts ‘acoustic zones’ within a physical space, associating specific intents with those zones. This moves beyond simple wake word detection to a continuous understanding of *where* commands are originating and *what* the user is likely intending based on location.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Multi-microphone array (minimum 4, ideally 8+) for accurate sound source localization.
*   Spatial audio processing unit (DSP or dedicated hardware accelerator).
*   Real-time kinematic (RTK) or Ultra-Wideband (UWB) positioning system (optional, for highly precise zone mapping).  Can be achieved via triangulation with multiple devices.
*   Device must be able to associate a User ID.

**Software Specifications:**

1.  **Zone Creation & Mapping:**
    *   User interface (app or voice commands) for defining acoustic zones. Example zones: "Kitchen Counter", "Living Room Sofa", "Bedroom Nightstand", "Home Office Desk".
    *   Automatic zone discovery through acoustic fingerprinting. The system learns typical sounds and patterns in specific areas.
    *   Zone boundaries are configurable (shape, size) and can be dynamically adjusted based on occupancy and user behavior.

2.  **Sound Source Localization:**
    *   Implement beamforming and triangulation algorithms to accurately determine the location of the sound source (user).
    *   Filter out noise and competing sound sources using advanced signal processing techniques.

3.  **Intent Mapping:**
    *   Associate predefined intents with each acoustic zone. Example:
        *   "Kitchen Counter" -> "Timer", "Recipe", "Grocery List"
        *   "Living Room Sofa" -> "Movie", "Music", "Smart Lighting"
        *   "Bedroom Nightstand" -> "Alarm", "Sleep Sounds", "Night Light"
    *   User-configurable intent associations.
    *   Probabilistic intent prediction based on zone location *and* speech content.

4.  **Adaptive Recognition:**
    *   Adjust wake word sensitivity and speech recognition parameters based on the identified zone. High sensitivity in expected zones, lower elsewhere to reduce false positives.
    *   Implement contextual filtering. If a user is in the "Kitchen Counter" zone, prioritize commands related to cooking.
    *   Implement Noise Cancellation profiles tied to acoustic zones.

5.  **Multi-User Support:**
    *   User identification via voice biometrics or proximity sensors.
    *   Personalized intent mapping and recognition settings for each user.

**Pseudocode (Intent Prediction):**

```
function predictIntent(audioInput, userLocation):
  userProfile = getUserProfile(userID)
  zone = getZone(userLocation)
  zoneIntentList = userProfile.getZoneIntentList(zone)
  speechKeywords = extractKeywords(audioInput)

  // Calculate intent score based on zone, keywords, and user history
  intentScore = 0
  for each intent in zoneIntentList:
    if intent contains speechKeywords:
      intentScore += 100
  intentScore += getUserPreferenceScore(intent) // based on past interactions

  bestIntent = findIntentWithHighestScore(intentScore)
  return bestIntent
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with smart home devices and automation systems.
*   Context-aware assistance (e.g., automatically displaying a recipe on a smart display when the user is near the kitchen counter).
*   Support for gesture control within acoustic zones.
*   Dynamic zone adjustment based on user activity (e.g., automatically creating a “workspace” zone when the user sits at their desk).
*   Allow user to specify the confidence in the result to change to another Operating Mode.
