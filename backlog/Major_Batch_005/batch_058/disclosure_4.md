## Modular, Bio-Integrated Power Adapters

**Concept:** Develop a plug adapter system comprised of swappable, bio-integrated modules that harvest ambient energy to supplement or replace traditional power sources. These modules would clip onto a standardized "core" adapter, enabling customized power solutions for various devices and environments.

**Core Adapter Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** Rectangular prism, 5cm x 3cm x 1.5cm. Constructed from a durable, lightweight bioplastic.
*   **Connectivity:** Universal plug interface (compatible with US, EU, UK, etc.) integrated into one face. Modular connection points (magnetic, standardized) on all other faces.
*   **Internal Bus:** Low-voltage DC bus for power distribution. Data communication protocol (Bluetooth Low Energy) for module identification & status.
*   **Housing:** Semi-transparent bioplastic, allowing visual indication of module status (LED indicators within modules).

**Module Types (Examples):**

1.  **Thermoelectric Module:**
    *   **Function:** Harvests energy from temperature differentials.
    *   **Specs:** Uses Peltier elements to convert heat into electricity. Module size: 3cm x 3cm x 1cm. Requires direct contact with a heat source (e.g., hot water pipe, engine block). Output: 5V DC, up to 2W.
    *   **Pseudocode:**
        ```
        IF (temp_hot > temp_cold + temp_threshold) THEN
          power = peltier_efficiency * (temp_hot - temp_cold)
          output_voltage = power / current_draw
          send_data(output_voltage, "Thermoelectric Module")
        ENDIF
        ```

2.  **Kinetic Energy Module:**
    *   **Function:** Converts mechanical vibrations into electricity.
    *   **Specs:** Uses piezoelectric materials or micro-generators. Module size: 2cm x 2cm x 1cm. Designed for attachment to vibrating surfaces (e.g., machinery, vehicles). Output: 3V DC, up to 1W.
    *   **Pseudocode:**
        ```
        vibration_level = read_sensor()
        IF (vibration_level > vibration_threshold) THEN
          energy_generated = piezoelectric_constant * vibration_level
          output_voltage = energy_generated / current_draw
          send_data(output_voltage, "Kinetic Module")
        ENDIF
        ```

3.  **Biofuel Cell Module:**
    *   **Function:** Generates electricity from organic matter (e.g., sweat, plant matter, wastewater).
    *   **Specs:** Microfluidic channel for organic matter input. Enzyme-based biofuel cell for electricity generation. Module size: 4cm x 2cm x 1.5cm. Requires periodic replenishment of organic matter. Output: 1.5V DC, up to 0.5W.
    *   **Pseudocode:**
        ```
        organic_matter_level = read_sensor()
        IF (organic_matter_level > threshold) THEN
          power = biofuel_efficiency * organic_matter_level
          output_voltage = power / current_draw
          send_data(output_voltage, "Biofuel Cell")
        ENDIF
        ```

4.  **RF Harvesting Module:**
    *   **Function:** Captures ambient radio frequency (RF) energy.
    *   **Specs:** Antenna array optimized for specific frequency bands. Rectenna circuit for RF-to-DC conversion. Module size: 3cm x 2cm x 1cm. Output: 3V DC, up to 0.2W.
    *   **Pseudocode:**
        ```
        RF_level = read_sensor()
        IF (RF_level > RF_threshold) THEN
          energy_harvested = RF_efficiency * RF_level
          output_voltage = energy_harvested / current_draw
          send_data(output_voltage, "RF Harvester")
        ENDIF
        ```

**System Operation:**

*   User selects desired modules based on available energy sources.
*   Modules magnetically attach to the core adapter.
*   Core adapter automatically detects attached modules and manages power distribution.
*   LED indicators on core adapter display module status (active, charging, error).
*   Data communication via Bluetooth allows users to monitor energy harvesting performance and optimize module selection.
