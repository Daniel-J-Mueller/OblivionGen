## Adaptive Data Sharding based on Query Entropy

**Concept:** Extend the composite key indexing by dynamically adjusting data sharding (partitioning) based on real-time query entropy. The system monitors the distribution of range key values accessed in queries.  If a specific range key range consistently experiences high query load (high entropy), that range is proactively split and replicated across more nodes. Conversely, infrequently accessed ranges are merged or consolidated.  This creates a self-optimizing, workload-aware data distribution.

**Specifications:**

**1. Entropy Monitoring Module:**

*   **Input:** Query logs (timestamp, hash key, range key condition, number of results returned).
*   **Process:**
    *   Calculate entropy for each hash key/range key combination over a rolling time window (e.g., 1 hour). Entropy is calculated as a measure of unpredictability in the range key values being queried within that hash key’s space.  Higher entropy means a wider distribution of accessed range key values – more workload.  Lower entropy means the queries are clustered around specific range key values.
    *   Store entropy values per hash key, alongside metrics like query frequency, average response time, and data size.
    *   Threshold-based alerting: Trigger alerts when entropy exceeds predefined thresholds for a given hash key.
*   **Output:**  Entropy scores and alerts for each hash key.

**2. Dynamic Sharding Manager:**

*   **Input:** Entropy scores, data size per shard, node capacity, alert triggers.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Shard Splitting:** If entropy for a hash key exceeds a high threshold *and* the shard size for that hash key exceeds a predefined limit, initiate a shard split.
        *   Select a "split point" range key value. This could be the median or a percentile of range key values in the shard.
        *   Create two new shards: one containing range key values less than the split point, and another containing range key values greater than or equal to the split point.
        *   Rebalance data and metadata to the new shards.
        *   Replicate new shards across multiple nodes for fault tolerance and increased capacity.
    *   **Shard Merging:** If entropy falls below a low threshold *and* shard size is below a minimum threshold, consider merging shards.
        *   Identify adjacent shards with low entropy and similar data distributions.
        *   Merge data from the identified shards into a single shard.
        *   Rebalance data and metadata.
    *   **Data Migration:** Orchestrate data migration between shards without interrupting query processing. Use techniques like consistent hashing and background data transfer.
*   **Output:** Shard splitting/merging requests, data migration instructions.

**3. Metadata Management:**

*   Maintain a global metadata store that maps hash keys and range key ranges to physical shard locations.
*   Update metadata in real-time as shards are split or merged.
*   Distribute updated metadata to query processing nodes.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Sharding Manager):**

```
function manageShards(entropyData, shardInfo):
  for each hashKey in entropyData:
    currentEntropy = entropyData[hashKey].entropy
    shardSize = shardInfo[hashKey].size
    
    if currentEntropy > HIGH_ENTROPY_THRESHOLD and shardSize > MAX_SHARD_SIZE:
      splitPoint = determineSplitPoint(hashKey)
      createShards(hashKey, splitPoint)
      rebalanceData(hashKey)
    
    if currentEntropy < LOW_ENTROPY_THRESHOLD and shardSize < MIN_SHARD_SIZE:
      mergeShards(hashKey)
      rebalanceData(hashKey)
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems typically rely on static sharding strategies or manual partitioning. This design introduces a *reactive* and *adaptive* sharding mechanism that automatically adjusts to changing workload patterns, potentially improving query performance, scalability, and resource utilization. The entropy calculation provides a quantitative measure of query distribution, enabling informed partitioning decisions.
