**Personalized Ambient Notification System**

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply *routing* messages to devices. Create an ambient notification system that leverages environmental context and user biometrics to deliver information *subtly* and proactively, rather than relying on direct device alerts.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensory Input Suite:**
    *   Microphone array: Ambient sound analysis (identifying speech, music, specific sounds - like a doorbell).
    *   Low-resolution camera: Facial recognition (user presence/identity), activity detection (are they focused on a task, idle, etc.).  *No* detailed image capture. Purely for presence & coarse activity.
    *   Environmental sensors: Temperature, humidity, light levels.
    *   Wearable integration: Heart rate variability (HRV) & skin conductance sensors (stress/engagement levels). *Optional* - system operates without wearables, but integration enhances personalization.

*   **Contextual Engine:**
    *   Rule-based system combined with a lightweight machine learning model.
    *   Inputs: Sensory data, calendar events, location (geofencing), user preferences (defined in a companion app).
    *   Outputs:  "Notification Scores" for various ambient delivery methods.  Score ranges 0-100.

*   **Ambient Delivery Methods:**
    *   **Smart Lighting:** Color/intensity adjustments.  (Score > 70: Subtle color shift indicating a low-priority message. Score > 90: Pulsing light for high-priority).
    *   **Spatial Audio:** Directional sound cues.  (Score > 60:  A gentle sound originating from the direction of a relevant object or area – e.g., a reminder about a package originating from the direction of the front door.).
    *   **Haptic Feedback (Integrated into Furniture/Wearables):** Subtle vibrations. (Score > 80:  A brief vibration on a chair or wearable, linked to a visual or audio cue).
    *   **Aromatherapy (Optional):**  Release of subtle scents. (Score > 95:  A brief, calming scent for stress relief, or an invigorating scent for a wake-up call). – requires dedicated hardware.

*   **User Interface (Companion App):**
    *   Preference Settings:  Control over ambient delivery methods, sensitivity levels, and notification types.
    *   "Learning Mode":  Allows the system to learn user preferences based on observed behavior (e.g., noticing when a user dismisses a notification, or reacts positively to a specific cue).
    *   Privacy Controls:  Explicit control over data collection and usage.

**Pseudocode (Contextual Engine):**

```
function calculate_notification_score(user_state, event_type, ambient_cue_type):
  // User State: HRV, activity level, location
  // Event Type: Calendar reminder, message from specific contact, package delivery
  // Ambient Cue Type: Lighting, audio, haptic

  base_score = 0

  //Priority based on event
  if event_type == "Emergency":
      base_score = 90
  else if event_type == "Calendar Reminder":
      base_score = 50
  else if event_type == "Message from VIP Contact":
      base_score = 70
  else:
      base_score = 30

  // Adjust based on user state
  if user_state.activity_level == "Focused":
      base_score = base_score * 0.5  //Lower score for non-intrusive cues
  if user_state.stress_level > 0.8:
      base_score = base_score * 0.7 //Reduce intrusiveness if stressed

  //Adjust based on ambient cue type
  if ambient_cue_type == "Lighting":
      base_score = base_score * 0.8
  if ambient_cue_type == "Audio":
      base_score = base_score * 0.9
  if ambient_cue_type == "Haptic":
      base_score = base_score * 1.0

  //Limit Score
  score = min(100, score)
  return score
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply routing to a device.  It’s about *proactive* and *ambient* information delivery, personalized based on biometric data *and* environmental context. The system anticipates needs and provides information in a subtle, non-disruptive way. It’s about making information feel less like an interruption and more like an extension of the environment.
