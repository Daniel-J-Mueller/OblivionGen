## Modular Acoustic Accelerator System

**Concept:** Expand the modular hardware acceleration concept to encompass acoustic processing. Create a system where specialized acoustic processing modules can be dynamically added to a rack-mounted system, allowing for adaptable and scalable acoustic analysis and synthesis.

**Specifications:**

**1. Acoustic Processing Module (APM) – Chassis:**

*   **Form Factor:** 1U Rack Mount, identical physical dimensions to existing hardware acceleration modules.
*   **Connectors:**
    *   High-bandwidth data interface (PCIe 4.0 x16 preferred) for communication with the Modular Controller.
    *   Multiple (8 minimum) XLR/TRS combo jacks for audio input/output.
    *   Optical (ADAT/SPDIF) input/output ports.
    *   Dedicated synchronization port (Word Clock, MADI) for multi-module synchronization.
    *   Front-panel access for diagnostic LEDs and basic module configuration (via USB-C).

**2. Acoustic Processing Module – Internal Components:**

*   **Processing Core:**  Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) with dedicated Digital Signal Processing (DSP) blocks.  The FPGA allows for reconfiguration to support a wide variety of acoustic algorithms.
*   **Analog-to-Digital/Digital-to-Analog Converters (ADCs/DACs):** High-resolution (24-bit/192kHz minimum), low-noise ADCs and DACs for pristine audio quality.  Separate ADC/DAC pairs for each input/output channel.
*   **Memory:** High-bandwidth DDR4 RAM for algorithm data and processing buffers.  Minimum 8GB.
*   **I/O Controller:** PCIe interface controller for communication with the Modular Controller.
*   **Power Supply:** Redundant power supplies for reliability.

**3. Modular Controller – Acoustic Extension:**

*   **Software Framework:**  An extension to the existing Modular Controller software.  This extension allows users to:
    *   Discover and configure available Acoustic Processing Modules.
    *   Define acoustic processing pipelines (e.g., noise reduction, beamforming, spatial audio rendering).
    *   Allocate resources (FPGA logic, memory) to each module.
    *   Monitor module performance and health.
*   **Pipeline Definition Language:**  A visual, node-based programming environment for creating and editing acoustic processing pipelines.  Nodes represent individual processing algorithms (e.g., FFT, convolution, filtering).
*   **Algorithm Library:**  A curated library of pre-built acoustic processing algorithms.  Users can also upload custom algorithms (e.g., VST plugins) for use in the pipelines.
*   **Real-time Processing Engine:**  A high-performance processing engine optimized for real-time audio processing.  Supports multi-threading and hardware acceleration.

**4. Acoustic Processing Pipeline Examples:**

*   **Spatial Audio Rendering:** Multiple APMs connected to a rack, fed by multi-channel audio input. The pipeline renders a 3D soundscape, placing audio sources in a virtual environment.
*   **Acoustic Beamforming:** Array of APMs with synchronized inputs/outputs. Beamforming algorithms focus on audio from a specific direction, effectively filtering out noise.
*   **Advanced Noise Reduction:** APM dedicated to noise reduction, using spectral subtraction, adaptive filtering, and machine learning techniques to remove unwanted noise.
*   **Acoustic Event Detection:** APM dedicated to audio analysis. Detects and classifies acoustic events such as speech, music, alarms, or specific sounds.

**Pseudocode (Pipeline Definition):**

```
Pipeline "SpatialAudio" {
  Input: MultiChannelAudio (8 channels)

  Module "Spatializer" {
    Algorithm: HRTF-based spatialization
    Parameters:
      Head Orientation: User-defined
      Reverberation: Configurable
  }

  Module "AmbisonicEncoder" {
    Algorithm: Ambisonic encoding (3rd order)
  }

  Output: AmbisonicAudio (4 channels)
}
```

**Scalability:** Multiple racks of Acoustic Processing Modules can be interconnected to create a massive, distributed acoustic processing system.  This would be useful for applications such as large-scale concert halls, sound stages, and virtual reality environments.
