**Adaptive Bitrate Prediction via Generative AI & User Biometrics**

**Concept:** Leverage generative AI to *predict* optimal bitrate settings *before* playback even begins, personalized by real-time user biometric data. This moves beyond reactive adjustment (as in the supplied patent) to a proactive system minimizing buffering and maximizing quality.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Biometric Input Module:**
    *   Sensors: Integrate with device sensors (camera, microphone, heart rate monitor – optional).
    *   Data Collected: Facial expressions (indicating engagement/frustration), vocal tone (stress/satisfaction), heart rate variability (HRV – stress/relaxation).
    *   Preprocessing: Noise reduction, signal amplification, feature extraction (e.g., micro-expressions, vocal pitch contours, HRV metrics).

2.  **Generative AI Model (GAN):**
    *   Architecture: Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN).
    *   Training Data: Historical streaming data (bitrate, buffering events, quality metrics) *paired* with biometric data from a large user base.
    *   Input: Current user's biometric data *and* session characteristics (device type, network conditions, content genre).
    *   Output: Predicted optimal bitrate profile for the next X seconds/minutes of playback.  This is *not* a single bitrate, but a time-series prediction of bitrate adjustments.

3.  **Bitrate Prediction Engine:**
    *   API:  Receives predicted bitrate profile from the GAN.
    *   Buffering Strategy:  Dynamically adjusts pre-buffering amounts based on the predicted bitrate profile.  Higher predicted bitrates = more pre-buffering.
    *   Integration: Seamlessly integrates with existing adaptive bitrate streaming protocols (HLS, DASH).
    *   Feedback Loop: Tracks actual playback performance (buffering, quality) and feeds this data *back* into the GAN for continuous model refinement.

4.  **Session Characteristics Module:**
    *   Data Collected: Device type, operating system, network connection type (Wi-Fi, cellular), signal strength, location (for CDN selection).
    *   Data Integration: Combines session characteristics with biometric data as input to the GAN.

**Pseudocode (Bitrate Prediction Engine):**

```
function predict_bitrate(user_biometrics, session_characteristics):
  # Call the GAN to get the predicted bitrate profile
  bitrate_profile = GAN.predict(user_biometrics, session_characteristics)

  # Adjust pre-buffering based on the predicted profile
  prebuffer_amount = calculate_prebuffer(bitrate_profile)

  # Request initial segments with adjusted pre-buffering
  request_initial_segments(bitrate_profile, prebuffer_amount)

  # Monitor playback & update model
  monitor_playback(bitrate_profile)
  update_GAN_model(playback_data)

  return bitrate_profile
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond *reactive* bitrate adjustment to a *predictive* approach powered by generative AI and personalized by user biometrics. It anticipates streaming needs *before* they arise, minimizing buffering and maximizing quality. Existing ABR systems primarily respond to network conditions and playback metrics. This system actively *predicts* those conditions based on user state and content characteristics.
