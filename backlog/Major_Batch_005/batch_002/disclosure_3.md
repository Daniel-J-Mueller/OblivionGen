## Dynamic TTL based on Predicted User Behavior & Content ‘Freshness’

**Concept:** Expand the dynamic TTL concept to not just react to *system* load, but to *predict* user re-request probability based on individual user history and content volatility, proactively adjusting TTL values to minimize perceived latency *and* maximize content relevance.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Modeling**

1.  **User History Tracking:**  Maintain a rolling history (e.g., last 30-90 days) of content requests per user ID.  Record:
    *   Content ID
    *   Timestamp of Request
    *   TTL received with the content (if any)
    *   Whether the request was a 'fresh' request (user re-requested *before* TTL expiry) or a 'stale' request (user re-requested *after* TTL expiry).

2.  **Content Volatility Scoring:**  Assign each content item a ‘volatility score’ based on update frequency. 
    *   **Static Content:** (e.g., images, infrequently updated documents) – Volatility Score = 0.
    *   **Moderate Content:** (e.g., news articles updated hourly) – Volatility Score = 1-5.
    *   **Dynamic Content:** (e.g., stock prices, live sports scores) – Volatility Score = 6-10.  This score should be programmatically updated.

3.  **Prediction Model:** Implement a simple probabilistic model (e.g., Bayesian network, Markov model) to predict the probability of a user re-requesting content *before* TTL expiry. The model should consider:
    *   User’s historical re-request behavior for similar content.
    *   Content’s volatility score.
    *   Current time of day/day of week (users may have predictable access patterns).

**II. TTL Calculation Algorithm**

1.  **Base TTL:** Establish a base TTL for each content type (e.g., images = 60 seconds, articles = 300 seconds).

2.  **Prediction-Based Adjustment:**
    *   For each content request:
        *   Retrieve user history.
        *   Calculate predicted re-request probability.
        *   Adjust TTL based on the following logic:
            *   **High Probability ( > 70%):**  Reduce TTL (e.g., by 50%) – prioritize perceived responsiveness.
            *   **Medium Probability (30-70%):** Use base TTL.
            *   **Low Probability (< 30%):** Increase TTL (e.g., by 2x) – prioritize reduced server load.
            *   Volatility score will also factor. High volatility content should never have a very high TTL.

3.  **System Load Integration:**  Continue to monitor system load.  If system load is high, further reduce TTLs *across the board* as a fallback mechanism.

**III. Implementation Details**

1.  **Service Architecture:** Implement this logic within a dedicated "Dynamic TTL Service" which sits in front of the content servers. This service intercepts requests, calculates the TTL, and adds it to the response.

2.  **Caching:** Cache user history and content volatility scores to minimize latency.

3.  **Monitoring & Tuning:**  Monitor the effectiveness of the algorithm (e.g., number of stale requests, server load) and tune the parameters (probability thresholds, TTL adjustment factors) accordingly.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculateTTL(userID, contentID):
    userHistory = getUserHistory(userID)
    volatilityScore = getContentVolatility(contentID)
    baseTTL = getContentBaseTTL(contentID)
    
    reRequestProbability = predictReRequestProbability(userHistory, volatilityScore)
    
    if reRequestProbability > 0.7:
        adjustedTTL = baseTTL * 0.5
    elif reRequestProbability < 0.3:
        adjustedTTL = baseTTL * 2
    else:
        adjustedTTL = baseTTL

    systemLoadFactor = getSystemLoadFactor() // Returns a value between 0.5 and 1.5
    finalTTL = adjustedTTL * systemLoadFactor
    
    return finalTTL
```
