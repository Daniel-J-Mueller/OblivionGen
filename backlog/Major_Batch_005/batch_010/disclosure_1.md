## Dynamic Network "Shadowing" & Predictive Resilience

**Concept:** Extend the failure scenario modeling to include *active* “shadowing” of network paths and nodes. Instead of just *calculating* load under failure, proactively replicate critical traffic flows onto diverse, underutilized paths *before* failures occur. This creates a pre-stressed network capable of absorbing disruptions with minimal impact.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow Path Selection Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time network topology, link utilization, node health, predicted traffic matrix (based on historical data & AI forecasting).
*   **Process:** Identifies critical traffic flows (defined by QoS requirements, business impact, etc.). For each critical flow, determines a set of *shadow paths* – alternate routes with sufficient bandwidth and minimal common infrastructure with the primary path. Shadow path selection prioritizes diversity (disjoint links & nodes) over raw latency.  A scoring function weighs path diversity, available bandwidth, and latency.
*   **Output:** A dynamic "shadow routing table" mapping critical flows to their designated shadow paths.

**2. Traffic Replication Engine:**

*   **Input:** Shadow routing table, real-time traffic flows.
*   **Process:**  Replicates a configurable percentage of each critical flow onto its designated shadow path. Replication percentage is determined by a risk assessment algorithm (considering predicted failure probability, business impact, and available bandwidth).  Traffic is encapsulated using a unique identifier allowing for de-duplication at the destination.
*   **Output:**  Mirrored traffic streams flowing over both primary and shadow paths.

**3. Failure Detection & Switchover Protocol:**

*   **Input:** Network monitoring data (link status, node health, traffic patterns).
*   **Process:** Detects network failures (link down, node unreachable). Upon detection, the protocol instantly switches traffic from the failed path to the pre-established shadow path.  The switchover is seamless, minimizing packet loss and latency. A "health check" confirms the shadow path is functional before completing the switch.
*   **Output:** Redirected traffic flows over the resilient shadow path.

**4.  AI-Driven Shadow Path Optimization:**

*   **Process:**  A reinforcement learning agent continuously monitors network performance and adjusts the shadow routing table. The agent learns to optimize shadow path selection based on observed network behavior and failure patterns. This includes dynamically adjusting replication percentages and adapting to changing network conditions.
*   **Output:**  An updated shadow routing table reflecting the optimized configuration.

**Pseudocode (Shadow Path Selection Module):**

```
function selectShadowPaths(topology, utilization, trafficMatrix):
  shadowPaths = {}
  for flow in trafficMatrix:
    primaryPath = findShortestPath(topology, flow.source, flow.destination)
    candidatePaths = findAlternatePaths(topology, flow.source, flow.destination)
    scoredPaths = []
    for path in candidatePaths:
      diversityScore = calculateDiversity(primaryPath, path)
      bandwidthScore = calculateBandwidth(path, utilization)
      latencyScore = calculateLatency(path)
      totalScore = (diversityScore * weightDiversity) + (bandwidthScore * weightBandwidth) + (latencyScore * weightLatency)
      scoredPaths.append((path, totalScore))
    scoredPaths.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    shadowPaths[flow] = scoredPaths[0][0] // Select top-scored path
  return shadowPaths
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance network switches with support for traffic mirroring and advanced routing protocols.
*   Dedicated hardware accelerators for packet processing and encryption.
*   Real-time network monitoring infrastructure.
