## Dynamic Channel Prediction via User Movement Pattern Analysis

**Concept:** Leverage user movement patterns (predicted paths) to proactively pre-scan potential channel bandwidths *before* a traditional cell search is initiated, significantly reducing search time and power consumption.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Storage:**

*   **Movement History:** Device stores a history of user movement, including GPS coordinates, timestamp, speed, and direction. Data retention configurable (e.g., 7 days, 30 days, indefinite).
*   **Channel Map Database:** Cloud-based (or local) database storing channel bandwidth usage data correlated to geographical locations. Data sourced from user devices (aggregated and anonymized) and/or network operators. Granularity: variable, based on data availability (e.g., city, neighborhood, street level).
*   **Movement Prediction Engine:** On-device model (RNN or similar) trained to predict future user trajectory based on movement history. Updates model continuously.

**2. Predictive Channel Scanning Process:**

*   **Trajectory Prediction:** At each interval (e.g., 5 seconds), the movement prediction engine forecasts the user’s path for the next X seconds (configurable - e.g., 10, 30, 60 seconds).
*   **Geofence Creation:** Define a ‘scanning geofence’ encompassing the predicted trajectory.  Dynamic resizing based on speed – faster speeds = larger geofence.
*   **Channel Bandwidth Probability Lookup:**  Query the channel map database with the scanning geofence coordinates.  Retrieve a ranked list of probable channel bandwidths used in that area, with associated confidence scores.
*   **Pre-Scan Execution:**  Initiate a low-power ‘pre-scan’ on the top N (configurable - e.g., 3, 5, 10) probable channel bandwidths *before* a traditional cell search is triggered.  This scan is a simplified version of the cell search – focused on identifying signal presence, *not* full decoding.
*   **Prioritized Cell Search:**  When a traditional cell search is triggered (e.g., loss of signal, handover), prioritize scanning the channel bandwidths identified by the pre-scan. If the pre-scan fails to identify any signals, then fallback to a standard full bandwidth scan.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **On-Device Components:**
    *   GPS Module
    *   Movement Prediction Engine (RNN/LSTM)
    *   Pre-Scan Module
    *   Data Storage (Movement History)
*   **Cloud/Network Components:**
    *   Channel Map Database
    *   Data Aggregation & Anonymization Service
    *   Model Update Service (for the movement prediction engine)

**4. Pseudocode (Pre-Scan Logic):**

```
FUNCTION performPreScan():
  predictedTrajectory = getPredictedTrajectory()
  geofence = createGeofence(predictedTrajectory)
  probableBandwidths = queryChannelMapDatabase(geofence) // Returns ranked list
  
  FOR bandwidth IN probableBandwidths.topN(5):
    preScanResult = performLowPowerScan(bandwidth)
    IF preScanResult.signalDetected:
      // Prioritize this bandwidth during full cell search
      signalPriorityList.add(bandwidth)
```

**5. Advanced Features:**

*   **Social Network Integration:**  Leverage data from friends/family in the same area to refine channel bandwidth predictions.
*   **Time of Day/Day of Week Adjustment:**  Account for variations in channel usage based on time of day and day of week.
*   **Event-Based Prediction:** Incorporate known events (e.g., concerts, sporting events) to predict increased network usage on specific channels.
*    **Beamforming Integration**: Use pre-scan results to inform beamforming algorithms, focusing signal reception on the most probable channels.
