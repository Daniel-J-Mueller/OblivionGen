## Dynamic Hypermedia Resource Prediction with Client-Side ‘Shadow’ Documents

**Concept:** Extend the embedding of hypermedia resources by allowing the client to proactively ‘shadow’ potential future requests based on observed patterns *and* predicted needs. Instead of *only* embedding resources based on past API request patterns, the client builds a local, speculative document containing resources it anticipates needing.

**Specifications:**

**1. Client-Side Shadow Document Creation:**

*   **Observation Phase:** Upon initial application load, the client observes API request patterns as described in the patent.
*   **Pattern Identification:** The client analyzes the observed patterns. Instead of solely using these for embedding, it uses them to build a prediction model (simple Markov chain or more complex RNN are possibilities).
*   **Prediction Engine:** A local prediction engine estimates the probability of future API requests.
*   **Shadow Document Assembly:** The client proactively fetches and assembles a 'shadow document' containing hypermedia resources predicted to be needed, based on the prediction model.  This document is *not* immediately sent to the server. It's a local cache.
*   **Thresholding:**  A probability threshold determines which predicted resources are included in the shadow document. This avoids excessive pre-fetching.

**2.  Request Interception and Shadow Document Integration:**

*   **API Request Interception:** Before sending an API request, the client checks the shadow document.
*   **Resource Match:** If the requested resource (or a closely related one) is found in the shadow document:
    *   The client serves the resource *directly* from the shadow document.
    *   The API request is *canceled* (not sent to the server).
*   **Shadow Document Update:** Whether the request is served from the shadow document or sent to the server, the prediction model and shadow document are updated to reflect the actual request.

**3. Server-Side Adaptations (Minimal):**

*   **Request Cancellation Detection:**  The server should be able to detect canceled requests (e.g., via HTTP status code, timeout). This allows monitoring of the system’s effectiveness.
*   **'Hint' Header (Optional):** The client *could* include a header in requests that *were* sent, indicating resources it *anticipated* needing but did not find in its shadow document.  This data can be used to refine server-side predictions.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
shadowDocument = new Document();
predictionModel = new PredictionModel();

// On API Request
function handleApiRequest(request) {
  predictedResource = predictionModel.predictNextResource(request);

  if (shadowDocument.contains(predictedResource)) {
    // Serve from shadow document
    serveResourceFromShadowDocument(predictedResource);
    // Cancel actual API request
    cancelApiRequest();
  } else {
    // Send API request to server
    sendApiRequestToServer(request);
    // Receive resource from server
    resource = receiveResourceFromServer();
    // Update shadow document
    shadowDocument.add(resource);
    // Update prediction model
    predictionModel.update(request, resource);
  }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Shadow Document:**  A key-value store where keys are resource identifiers and values are the hypermedia resources themselves.
*   **Prediction Model:**  A probabilistic model (e.g., Markov chain, RNN) that predicts the next resource a client is likely to request, based on observed request sequences.
*   **Resource Identifier:** A unique identifier for each hypermedia resource.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency (serving resources from local cache).
*   Reduced server load.
*   Improved user experience.
*   Proactive resource delivery.
*   Adaptation to individual client behavior.
