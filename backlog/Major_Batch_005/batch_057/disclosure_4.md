## Dynamic Content-Aware Metadata Injection & Action Profiles

**Concept:** Expand the metadata embedding concept beyond simple item information (price, availability) to encompass *dynamic action profiles* triggered by contextual analysis of the image content *itself*. 

**Specification:**

1.  **Content Analysis Module:** Integrate a lightweight, on-device (or edge-computing) image analysis module within the sending application. This module will perform object detection, scene recognition, and potentially even sentiment analysis on the image before embedding metadata.

2.  **Action Profile Database:** Develop a server-side database containing pre-defined "Action Profiles." Each profile will link specific image content characteristics (identified by the Content Analysis Module) to a set of actions. Examples:
    *   **"Outdoor Adventure" Profile:** (Detects hiking boots, mountains, tents). Actions: Display nearby hiking trail maps, link to outdoor gear retailers, offer discounts on camping equipment.
    *   **"Culinary Inspiration" Profile:** (Detects specific dishes, ingredients, kitchen settings). Actions: Display recipe links, offer grocery delivery options, suggest wine pairings.
    *   **"Pet Care" Profile:** (Detects specific breeds of animals). Actions: Display local vet information, link to pet food retailers, offer pet insurance quotes.
    *  **"Fashion Focus" Profile:** (Detects clothing items, styles, accessories). Actions: Link to similar items for sale, suggest complementary outfits, offer style advice.

3.  **Metadata Embedding:** Upon image capture/selection, the Content Analysis Module will analyze the image and identify relevant content characteristics. The application will then select the corresponding Action Profile and embed a pointer (ID) to that profile within the image metadata, *instead* of hardcoding item-specific information.

4.  **Receiving Application Logic:** The receiving application will extract the Action Profile ID from the metadata. It will then query the server-side database to retrieve the associated actions.  

5.  **Dynamic Action Execution:** The receiving application will dynamically execute the actions specified in the retrieved profile. Actions might include:
    *   Displaying contextual information (e.g., maps, recipes).
    *   Providing links to relevant products or services.
    *   Triggering personalized offers.
    *   Initiating external application calls (e.g., open a map app, start a video call).

**Pseudocode (Sending Application):**

```
function sendImage(imageFile):
    contentAnalysisResult = analyzeImage(imageFile) // Object detection, scene recognition
    actionProfileID = lookupActionProfile(contentAnalysisResult) // Query database
    embedMetadata(imageFile, "actionProfileID", actionProfileID)
    sendImageFile(imageFile)
```

**Pseudocode (Receiving Application):**

```
function receiveImage(imageFile):
    actionProfileID = extractMetadata(imageFile, "actionProfileID")
    actionProfile = fetchActionProfile(actionProfileID) // Query server
    executeActions(actionProfile) // Display contextual info, links, etc.
```

**Hardware Requirements:** Minimal. Existing smartphone cameras and processors are sufficient. Server infrastructure required for Action Profile Database.

**Software Requirements:** Image analysis library (TensorFlow Lite, Core ML), database management system, API for communication between applications and server.
