## Dynamic Contextual "World" Building – Interactive Fiction Integration

**Concept:** Expand the dynamically selected passages beyond simple definitions or supporting text. Integrate them into a branching, interactive fiction narrative *within* the reading experience. The selected passage becomes a "portal" to a short, contextually relevant scene.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Engine – “Passage Weaver”:**

*   **Input:** Current text selection (word, phrase, sentence) from the primary ebook/content. User profile data (reading history, preferences, demographic – optional but beneficial).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Contextual Analysis:** Analyze the surrounding text for keywords, sentiment, and narrative structure.
    *   **Scenario Generation:** Utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate a short (50-200 word) interactive fiction scene. The scene *must* organically incorporate the selected passage.
    *   **Choice Point Creation:**  The LLM creates 2-3 branching choices for the user *within* the generated scene. Choices should influence the scene’s outcome, though not drastically alter the primary reading experience. (Think subtle expansions of the current setting or character interaction).
    *   **Rendering:**  Present the generated scene as a popup window or overlay within the ebook reader.
*   **Output:**  Interactive fiction scene with choices. User selection feeds back into the engine to determine the next part of the scene (if any).

**2. Data Structure – “World Fragments”:**

*   Each ebook/content item should be associated with a database of “World Fragments”. These are pre-generated scene snippets that are linked to specific keywords or themes within the content.
*   The LLM can utilize these pre-generated fragments as building blocks, or generate entirely new scenes.
*   Fragments are tagged with metadata: genre, tone, complexity, and associated keywords. This allows for better scene selection.

**3. User Interface:**

*   **Activation:** Long-press or double-tap on a word/phrase to activate “Passage Weaver”.
*   **Scene Display:** Clean, minimalist overlay with clear choices.
*   **Contextual Link:** A small icon indicates a link back to the original passage.
*   **Customization:** User can adjust the frequency of scene generation and the complexity of the interactive fiction.

**Pseudocode – Passage Weaver Core:**

```
FUNCTION ProcessSelection(selectedText, contentContext, userProfile):
  // 1. Contextual Analysis
  keywords = ExtractKeywords(contentContext)
  sentiment = AnalyzeSentiment(contentContext)

  // 2. Scene Generation - PRIORITIZE World Fragments
  IF WorldFragmentExists(keywords) THEN
    scene = LoadWorldFragment(keywords)
  ELSE
    scene = GenerateSceneWithLLM(selectedText, keywords, sentiment, userProfile)

  // 3. Choice Point Creation (if not already present)
  IF scene.choices == NULL THEN
    scene.choices = GenerateChoicesWithLLM(scene.text, userProfile)

  // 4. Return Scene
  RETURN scene
```

**Innovation:**

This moves beyond passive context and into *active* world-building.  The user isn’t just receiving definitions, but actively *participating* in a dynamic extension of the narrative. This would be especially potent for fiction, historical texts, or educational materials. The use of pre-generated "World Fragments" speeds up processing and improves consistency. The UI is designed to be unobtrusive, keeping the focus on the primary reading experience. It's a blend of information retrieval and interactive storytelling.
