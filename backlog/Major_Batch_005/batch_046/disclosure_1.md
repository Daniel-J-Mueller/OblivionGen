## Adaptive Issue Complexity Scoring & Dynamic Agent Skill Tagging

**Concept:** Enhance agent assignment not just by skill, but by *dynamic* assessment of issue complexity and real-time agent capacity, creating a predictive system for optimal resolution speed and customer satisfaction.

**Specs:**

*   **Issue Complexity Engine:**
    *   Input: Raw customer communication (text, voice transcription, metadata â€“ e.g., keywords, sentiment analysis).
    *   Process:
        1.  NLP-based feature extraction: Identify key topics, entities, intent.
        2.  Complexity Score Calculation: Assign a score (1-10) based on feature analysis. Factors:
            *   Number of unique topics.
            *   Ambiguity/Vagueness (measured through linguistic analysis).
            *   Emotional tone (negative sentiment increases complexity).
            *   Historical Resolution Data: Issues similar to this one, and how long those issues took to resolve.
        3.  Real-time adaptation: The model learns from resolved issues, refining the complexity scoring algorithm.
*   **Agent Skill Tagging & Capacity:**
    *   Dynamic Skill Profile: Agents aren't statically tagged. Instead, their skill levels are assessed continuously.
    *   Performance Monitoring: Track resolution times, customer satisfaction scores, and escalation rates.
    *   Skill Decay: Skills that aren't used frequently decay over time, triggering retraining recommendations.
    *   Capacity Metric: A 'busy-ness' score reflecting current workload, handle time, and predicted availability.
*   **Intelligent Routing Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Issue Complexity Score, Agent Skill Profiles, Agent Capacity.
    *   Process:
        1.  Filter Agents: Eliminate agents without relevant skills.
        2.  Weighted Matching: Prioritize agents with:
            *   Highest Skill Level for the issue.
            *   Lowest Capacity/Highest Availability.
            *   Historical Performance on similar issues.
        3.  Predictive Routing: Utilize machine learning to predict the *probability* of successful resolution with each agent, factoring in their recent performance.
        4.  Escalation Threshold: Set a threshold for expected resolution time. If exceeded, automatically escalate the issue to a more experienced agent or a specialist.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION RouteIssue(issue):
  complexityScore = CalculateComplexityScore(issue)
  availableAgents = GetAvailableAgents(issue.topic)

  FOR agent IN availableAgents:
    skillLevel = GetAgentSkillLevel(agent, issue.topic)
    capacity = GetAgentCapacity(agent)
    predictedSuccess = PredictResolutionProbability(agent, issue, skillLevel, capacity)

    agentScore = skillLevel * 0.6 + predictedSuccess * 0.4

    agentScores[agent] = agentScore

  bestAgent = MAX(agentScores)

  AssignIssue(bestAgent, issue)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Cloud-based NLP engine for scalability and real-time processing.
*   Real-time data streaming platform (e.g., Kafka) for handling communication and performance data.
*   Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for training and deploying predictive models.
*   Integration with existing CRM and communication platforms.
