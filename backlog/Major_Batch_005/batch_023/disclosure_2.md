## Adaptive Regional Granularity for Network Usage Allocation

**Concept:** Enhance usage allocation by dynamically adjusting the granularity of regional data aggregation based on observed network traffic patterns. This addresses potential inaccuracies arising from fixed regional boundaries and allows for more precise cost allocation and optimization.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Collection & Initial Regional Assignment:**

*   Network devices (aggregation, transit, etc.) continue to observe traffic flow instances as per the base patent.
*   Each observed flow instance is initially assigned a region based on the location of the observing device. This serves as a starting point for regional allocation.
*   Collect flow data including: source address, destination address, observed volume, timestamps.

**2. Dynamic Granularity Adjustment Module:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement a real-time anomaly detection system analyzing traffic volume *between* regions. Key metrics:
    *   Volume exceeding a threshold.
    *   Sudden volume spikes.
    *   Unusual traffic patterns (e.g., large flows bypassing expected regional pathways).
*   **Sub-Regional Identification:** When anomalies are detected, trigger a sub-regional identification process.  This process utilizes geolocated IP address data (integrated with existing source/destination address information) to identify *clusters* of traffic originating or terminating within a larger region.
*   **Granularity Control:**
    *   **Default:** Operate at the base regional level (as defined by the network topology).
    *   **Anomaly Triggered:** When a cluster of anomalous traffic is identified, temporarily create a *sub-region* encompassing that cluster.  This sub-region is dynamically defined and may be small (e.g., a single data center, a city block).
    *   **Adaptive Adjustment:** Continuously monitor traffic within the sub-region.  If traffic stabilizes and aligns with expected patterns, the sub-region is either dissolved (reverting to the base region) or refined.
    *   **Hierarchical Structure:**  Allow for nested sub-regions.  A large region might contain multiple sub-regions, each further subdivided if necessary.
*   **Region Metadata:**  Maintain a region metadata database containing:
    *   Region ID
    *   Geographical boundaries (coordinates)
    *   Parent region ID (if applicable)
    *   Active status (whether the region is currently in use for allocation)

**3. Usage Allocation & Cost Calculation:**

*   The deduplication algorithm from the base patent is modified to incorporate the dynamic regional granularity.
*   Traffic instances are allocated to the *most granular* active region they fall within.
*   Cost calculation is performed based on usage within each region (including sub-regions).
*   Support proportional cost allocation across services utilizing the affected sub-regions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION ProcessTrafficInstance(instance)
  region = GetInitialRegion(instance.SourceAddress, instance.DestinationAddress)
  subRegion = FindActiveSubRegion(instance.SourceAddress, instance.DestinationAddress)

  IF subRegion != NULL THEN
    region = subRegion

  ENDIF

  ApplyDeduplicationAlgorithm(instance, region)
  CalculateUsage(region, instance.Volume)

  // Trigger Sub-Region Creation if anomalies are detected
  IF AnomalyDetected(instance) THEN
    CreateSubRegion(instance.SourceAddress, instance.DestinationAddress)
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CreateSubRegion(sourceAddress, destinationAddress)
    //Geolocate Source and Destination
    sourceLocation = GeolocateIP(sourceAddress)
    destinationLocation = GeolocateIP(destinationAddress)

    //Define boundaries of subregion based on locations
    newRegionID = GenerateNewRegionID()
    DefineRegionBoundaries(newRegionID, sourceLocation, destinationLocation)

    //Add Subregion to region metadata database
    AddRegionToDatabase(newRegionID, sourceLocation, destinationLocation)
END FUNCTION

```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires integration with geolocation services.
*   Demand real-time data processing capabilities for anomaly detection.
*   Scalable region metadata database.
*   Ability to dynamically update region assignments without disrupting network operations.
