## Adaptive Monitoring Zones & Predictive Delivery Confirmation

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple delivery event capture to *predict* delivery likelihood and dynamically adjust monitoring sensitivity based on predicted confidence. Integrate environmental data to refine predictions and trigger pre-emptive recording.

**Specifications:**

**1. Environmental Data Integration Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate with local weather APIs (temperature, precipitation, visibility), public event calendars (parades, construction), and traffic data feeds.
*   **Data Processing:** Normalize data formats, handle missing values, and establish weighting factors for each data source based on location-specific relevance.
*   **Output:** Generate a 'Delivery Confidence Score' (DCS) ranging from 0-100, reflecting the likelihood of a delivery within a defined timeframe.

**2. Dynamic Monitoring Zone Adjustment:**

*   **Baseline Zones:** Define pre-set monitoring zones around the monitored location (e.g., driveway, porch, front door). These zones have associated sensitivity levels (low, medium, high).
*   **DCS-Driven Adjustment:**
    *   **DCS < 30:**  Reduce sensitivity in all zones. Limited recording duration.
    *   **30 <= DCS < 70:** Standard sensitivity. Record duration = baseline.
    *   **70 <= DCS < 90:** Increase sensitivity in primary delivery zones. Extended record duration. Pre-emptive buffering enabled.
    *   **DCS >= 90:** Maximum sensitivity. Full area monitoring. Continuous pre-emptive buffering.
*   **Zone Prioritization:** Assign priority levels to zones based on historical delivery data. Higher priority zones receive increased attention during high DCS scenarios.

**3. Predictive Buffering & Event Stitching:**

*   **Pre-emptive Buffer:** Initiate recording *before* the predicted delivery time based on DCS and historical data. Buffer duration is dynamically adjusted.
*   **Event Stitching:** Seamlessly combine buffered footage with real-time recording to create a continuous event record, minimizing gaps or missed moments.
*   **AI-Powered Object Detection:** Integrate object detection (packages, delivery vehicles, personnel) to refine event boundaries and flag potential anomalies.

**4.  Automated Delivery Confirmation:**

*   **Package Recognition:**  Utilize AI to identify package types and delivery services.
*   **Visual Confirmation:**  Generate a series of images/video clips confirming package placement.
*   **Automated Notification:**  Send confirmation images/video to the user and delivery service, triggering delivery status updates.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Flag suspicious activity (package tampering, incorrect placement) and alert the user.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Zone Adjustment):**
