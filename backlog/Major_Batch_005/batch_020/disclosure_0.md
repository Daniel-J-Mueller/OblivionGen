## Data Set 'Shadowing' with Predictive Reconstitution

**Concept:** Extend the capture system to not just *store* copies of datasets, but to dynamically maintain a 'shadow' dataset comprised of predicted future states. This allows for near-instantaneous rollbacks *beyond* the scope of captured snapshots, and potential preemptive correction of data corruption.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Predictive Engine Integration:** Integrate a time-series forecasting engine (e.g., LSTM network, Prophet) into the storage policy enforcement component. This engine analyzes historical data set change patterns.

2.  **Shadow Data Set Creation:**  Alongside regular captures, a 'shadow' data set is maintained. The shadow isn’t a simple copy; it’s a probabilistic representation of the *predicted* data set state at a future time, calculated by the predictive engine.

3.  **Differential Storage:** The shadow dataset is stored *differentially* against the last full capture and the prior shadow state. This minimizes storage overhead.  Store only the predicted *changes* – the 'delta' between the current and predicted state.

4.  **Rollback Mechanism Enhancement:**  When a data corruption event is detected, the system can rollback *to a predicted state*, not just a captured one. This allows for recovery beyond the granularity of the existing capture schedule.  The rollback isn’t absolute; it’s a ‘best guess’ based on the prediction.

5.  **Confidence Scoring:** Each predicted data state has an associated 'confidence score'. This score represents the certainty of the prediction. The system should present this confidence score to users when proposing a rollback to a predicted state.

6.  **Adaptive Prediction Granularity:** The frequency and granularity of prediction updates are adaptive, based on observed data change rates and the confidence score. Higher change rates and lower confidence trigger more frequent updates.

7.  **Anomaly Detection Integration:** Anomaly detection algorithms run *on the prediction itself*.  Significant deviations between predicted changes and actual observed changes trigger alerts and potentially indicate a system compromise or emergent data corruption.

**Pseudocode – Shadow Update Process:**

```
FUNCTION UpdateShadow(dataSet, lastCapture, lastShadow, timeDelta):
  // 1. Analyze dataSet for changes since lastCapture
  changes = CalculateChanges(dataSet, lastCapture)

  // 2. Predict future changes using predictive engine
  predictedChanges = PredictiveEngine.PredictChanges(changes, timeDelta)

  // 3. Apply predicted changes to lastShadow to create newShadow
  newShadow = ApplyChanges(lastShadow, predictedChanges)

  // 4. Calculate confidence score for newShadow
  confidenceScore = CalculateConfidence(newShadow, predictedChanges)

  // 5. Store differential data (newShadow - lastShadow)
  StoreDifferentialData(newShadow, lastShadow)

  RETURN newShadow, confidenceScore
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Rapid Disaster Recovery:**  Rollback to a near-current predicted state minimizes data loss and recovery time.
*   **Proactive Error Correction:** Detect and correct potential data corruption before it becomes a critical issue.
*   **Simulation and Testing:** Use the predicted data set as a basis for simulations and testing.
*   **Forecasting and Analytics:** Leverage the prediction engine for data forecasting and analytical purposes.
