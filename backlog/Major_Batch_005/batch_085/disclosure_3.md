## Autonomous Multi-Agent Predictive Collision Avoidance System

**System Overview:**

This system extends the agent tracking and event association capabilities of the base patent to proactively predict and prevent collisions within a dynamic environment, specifically focusing on collaborative robotic systems (AGVs, AMRs) working alongside human agents. It moves beyond simply *associating* events to *predicting* them and triggering preventative actions.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Multi-Agent Motion Forecasting Module:**
    *   **Input:** Real-time image data (RGB-D preferred) capturing the environment, agent positions/velocities, mapped environment geometry.
    *   **Process:** Utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on a vast dataset of agent trajectories.  The LSTM predicts future trajectories (5-10 second horizon) for *all* identified agents within the camera’s field of view.  The model incorporates not just past movement, but also environmental constraints (obstacles, pathways) derived from a 3D map.  This module outputs a probability distribution for each agent's possible future locations.
    *   **Output:**  A set of predicted trajectories (probability-weighted) for each agent.

2.  **Collision Risk Assessment Module:**
    *   **Input:** Predicted trajectories from the Motion Forecasting Module, 3D environmental map, agent sizes/shapes.
    *   **Process:** This module continuously scans the predicted trajectories for potential collisions.  It utilizes a computationally efficient collision detection algorithm (e.g., separating axis theorem) to identify scenarios where agents may intersect within a defined timeframe. A ‘risk score’ is assigned to each potential collision, factoring in:
        *   Time to impact (lower = higher risk)
        *   Relative velocity of agents (higher = higher risk)
        *   Agent type (human vs. robot – human collisions are prioritized)
        *   Severity of potential impact (based on estimated impact force)
    *   **Output:** A prioritized list of potential collisions, along with associated risk scores and estimated time to impact.

3.  **Preventative Action Planning & Execution Module:**
    *   **Input:** Prioritized collision list, agent capabilities (e.g., maximum deceleration, turning radius), environmental constraints.
    *   **Process:** This module analyzes the potential collisions and formulates preventative actions. These actions could include:
        *   **Robotic Agent:**  Adjusting speed, altering trajectory, initiating emergency stop.
        *   **Human Agent:**  Providing visual/auditory warnings (e.g., projected alerts onto the floor, voice prompts). The system would also alert a remote operator if a high-risk situation is detected.
        *   **Collaborative Action:** Triggering a coordinated maneuver between multiple robots to create a safe pathway.
    *   **Output:** Control signals to robotic agents, activation of warning systems, alerts to remote operators.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Camera System:** Multiple synchronized RGB-D cameras providing overlapping coverage of the workspace. Minimum frame rate: 30 FPS. Resolution: 1920x1080.
*   **Processing Hardware:** High-performance computing cluster with multiple GPUs for real-time processing of image data and execution of AI models.
*   **Software Framework:** ROS (Robot Operating System) for inter-process communication and data management. PyTorch or TensorFlow for AI model training and inference.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Wireless communication (e.g., 5G) for real-time data exchange between cameras, processing cluster, and robotic agents.
*   **Data Storage:**  Cloud-based data storage for logging agent trajectories, collision events, and system performance metrics. This data will be used for continuous improvement of the AI models.

**Pseudocode (Collision Risk Assessment Module):**

```
FUNCTION assess_collision_risk(predicted_trajectories, environment_map, agent_sizes):
  collision_list = []
  FOR each agent_1 IN predicted_trajectories:
    FOR each agent_2 IN predicted_trajectories (excluding agent_1):
      FOR each time_step IN predicted_trajectory_horizon:
        IF check_collision(agent_1.position(time_step), agent_2.position(time_step), agent_1.size, agent_2.size, environment_map):
          risk_score = calculate_risk_score(time_step, agent_1.velocity, agent_2.velocity, agent_type(agent_1), agent_type(agent_2))
          collision_event = {
            "agent_1": agent_1.id,
            "agent_2": agent_2.id,
            "time_to_impact": time_step,
            "risk_score": risk_score
          }
          APPEND collision_event TO collision_list

  SORT collision_list BY risk_score DESCENDING
  RETURN collision_list
```

**Novelty:**

This system goes beyond reactive event association to *proactive* collision avoidance by predicting future agent trajectories and intervening *before* collisions occur. The focus on collaborative robotics and human-robot interaction within a dynamic environment represents a significant advancement in safety and efficiency. The integration of probabilistic trajectory prediction with a risk-based collision assessment framework enables intelligent and adaptive preventative actions.
