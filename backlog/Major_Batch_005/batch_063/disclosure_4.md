## Adaptive Emotional Tone Modulation for Voice-to-Text & Response

**Concept:** Expand upon the voice-enabled communication foundation to incorporate real-time emotional analysis of *both* the sender’s voice *and* the recipient’s expected emotional state to dynamically adjust the tone and phrasing of messages. This goes beyond simple sentiment analysis to attempt to foster better communication and rapport.

**Specs:**

*   **Module 1: Vocal Emotion Analysis (VEA):**
    *   Input: Raw audio stream from sender.
    *   Process: Utilize a multi-layered neural network (CNN-RNN hybrid) trained on a large dataset of emotionally-labeled speech. Outputs a vector representing the sender's perceived emotional state (e.g., joy, anger, sadness, neutrality, anxiety). Confidence scores for each emotion are crucial.
    *   Output: Emotion vector & confidence scores.

*   **Module 2: Recipient Profile & Contextual Awareness:**
    *   Input: Recipient’s communication history (texts, emails, etc.), social media data (with consent, of course!), calendar information (e.g., meeting immediately following message), and current time/day.
    *   Process: A separate neural network (Transformer-based) analyzes this data to build a profile of the recipient’s typical communication style, emotional baseline, and likely current emotional state. Emphasis on identifying trigger words/phrases based on past interactions.
    *   Output: Recipient emotional profile & predicted current state.

*   **Module 3: Dynamic Tone Modulation (DTM):**
    *   Input: Sender emotion vector (from VEA), recipient emotional profile & predicted state (from Module 2), and the original message body.
    *   Process: This is the core of the system. A large language model (LLM) – specifically fine-tuned for emotional rewriting – takes the original message and rewrites it to:
        *   Minimize potential emotional friction.
        *   Maximize perceived empathy/understanding.
        *   Adjust formality/informality based on context.
        *   Employ sentence structures and vocabulary that align with the recipient’s preferred communication style.
    *   Output: Rewritten message body.

*   **Module 4: Confidence Scoring & User Override:**
    *   Process: Assign a confidence score to the rewritten message based on the certainty of the emotional analyses and the LLM’s own internal assessment.
    *   Interface: Present the original and rewritten messages to the user with the confidence score. Allow the user to:
        *   Accept the rewritten message.
        *   Edit the rewritten message.
        *   Send the original message.
        *   Adjust the 'emotional sensitivity' level (e.g., ‘low,’ ‘medium,’ ‘high’).

**Pseudocode (DTM Module):**

```
FUNCTION RewriteMessage(sender_emotion, recipient_profile, original_message):
  // Emotional adjustment factors (tunable parameters)
  ANGER_THRESHOLD = 0.7
  SADNESS_THRESHOLD = 0.6

  IF sender_emotion.anger > ANGER_THRESHOLD:
    tone = "calming"
    vocabulary_filter = "remove aggressive words"
  ELSE IF sender_emotion.sadness > SADNESS_THRESHOLD:
    tone = "supportive"
    vocabulary_filter = "empathetic phrases"
  ELSE:
    tone = "neutral"
    vocabulary_filter = "none"

  // Fetch appropriate rewriting rules from a knowledge base based on tone and recipient profile
  rewriting_rules = GetRewritingRules(tone, recipient_profile)

  // Apply rewriting rules to the original message
  rewritten_message = ApplyRules(rewriting_rules, original_message)

  RETURN rewritten_message
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Multi-modal analysis:** Incorporate visual cues (video conferencing) and textual data (emails) to refine emotional assessments.
*   **Personalized LLM:** Train a separate LLM for each user based on their communication patterns and preferences.
*   **Real-time feedback:** Provide the user with feedback on the emotional impact of their messages *before* sending them.
*   **"Emotional mirroring":** Adapt the system to subtly mirror the recipient's emotional state (used cautiously to avoid manipulation).
