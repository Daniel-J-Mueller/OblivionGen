## Adaptive Multi-Viewpoint Presence

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Shared Computing Device: High-resolution camera array (minimum 4, optimally 6-8), directional microphone array (minimum 4, optimally 8+), dedicated edge processing unit (Neural Engine/GPU).
    *   Remote Participant Device: Standard videoconferencing capable device (PC, tablet, phone).
*   **Software:**
    *   Real-time 3D Reconstruction Module: Generates a dynamic 3D model of the shared space.
    *   AI-Powered Viewpoint Selector: Determines optimal viewpoints for each remote participant based on active speaker, gaze direction of device-sharing participants, and scene content.
    *   Rendering Engine: Renders the 3D scene from selected viewpoints and streams to remote participants.
    *   Gaze Tracking: Integrated gaze tracking for each device-sharing participant, utilizing camera data.
    *   Semantic Scene Understanding: AI module that identifies objects and areas of interest within the shared space (e.g., whiteboard, documents, other participants).

**Innovation Description:**

This system moves beyond simple video streams to create a *virtual presence* for device-sharing participants. Instead of a single camera view, the system reconstructs the shared space in 3D.  Each remote participant receives a personalized view rendered from a dynamically chosen viewpoint.  

The core innovation lies in the AI-powered viewpoint selector. It operates as follows:

1.  **Active Speaker Priority:** The viewpoint is initially aligned with the currently active speaker.
2.  **Gaze-Based Adjustment:** The viewpoint is subtly adjusted to follow the gaze direction of device-sharing participants.  If multiple participants are looking at a specific object or area, the viewpoint focuses on that point.
3.  **Semantic Awareness:** The system analyzes the scene to identify important elements. For example, if someone is writing on a whiteboard, the viewpoint automatically shifts to provide a clear view of the whiteboard.
4.  **Personalized View:** Based on previous interaction data, the system learns each remote participantâ€™s preferred viewing angle and adjusts the viewpoint accordingly.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Per-Frame Processing
FOR EACH remoteParticipant IN remoteParticipants:
    activeSpeaker = detectActiveSpeaker(audioData);
    gazeData = getGazeData(cameraData); // Returns vector of gaze directions
    sceneData = analyzeScene(cameraData); //Returns objects/areas of interest

    // Calculate base viewpoint (active speaker)
    viewpoint = activeSpeaker.position;

    //Adjust Viewpoint based on gaze
    FOR EACH gazeDirection IN gazeData:
        viewpoint = viewpoint + gazeDirection * gazeWeight;

    //Adjust Viewpoint based on scene understanding
    IF sceneData.whiteboardDetected:
        viewpoint = alignViewpointWithWhiteboard(viewpoint);

    //Apply personalized preferences
    viewpoint = applyPersonalizedPreferences(viewpoint, remoteParticipant);

    //Render scene from viewpoint
    renderedFrame = renderScene(sceneData, viewpoint);
    transmitFrame(remoteParticipant, renderedFrame);
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced sense of presence and engagement for remote participants.
*   Improved collaboration and understanding during meetings.
*   Ability to focus on important content and activities.
*   More natural and intuitive communication experience.
