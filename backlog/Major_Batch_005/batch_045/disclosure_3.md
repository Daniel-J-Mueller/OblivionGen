## Dynamic Annotation Projection & Layered Document Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the coordinate-based annotation system to support *projected* annotations – annotations that aren’t directly tied to the visual representation of the document in the coordinate space, but rather to semantic elements.  This allows for annotations to ‘stick’ to concepts *within* the document, even if the layout changes.  Furthermore, build a system to dynamically reconstruct multiple “layers” of the document based on different annotation sets, creating tailored views.

**Specifications:**

**1. Semantic Tagging Module:**

*   **Input:** Text-based document (e.g., DOCX, Markdown).
*   **Process:** Employ a Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relationship Extraction (RE) model (pre-trained or custom-trained). This module identifies key entities (people, organizations, dates, locations, concepts) and the relationships between them within the text.
*   **Output:**  A JSON structure containing the original text *with* embedded tags representing identified entities and relationships.  Example:  `"<entity type='PERSON'>John Smith</entity> met with <entity type='ORGANIZATION'>Acme Corp</entity> on <entity type='DATE'>2024-01-15</entity>."`

**2. Annotation Projection Engine:**

*   **Input:** Coordinate-based document (as currently supported), Semantic Tagging output.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Initial Linking:** Map initial visual annotations (highlights, rectangles, comments) to the *nearest* semantic entity or text span in the tagged document.  If no entity is close, associate the annotation with the text span it visually intersects.
    *   **Projection Mapping:** Create a mapping table linking visual annotations to semantic entities.
    *   **Dynamic Linking:**  Maintain a bi-directional link between visual annotations and their associated semantic entities.

**3. Layered Document Reconstruction Module:**

*   **Input:** Original text-based document, Semantic Tagging output, Annotation Projection Mapping, Layer Configuration (user-defined).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Layer Selection:** The user defines layers based on annotation sets (e.g., “Legal Review,” “Marketing Feedback,” “Technical Notes”).
    *   **Semantic Reconstruction:** The module retrieves the original text, applies the selected annotation set via the semantic links, and reconstructs the document. This includes:
        *   Re-applying highlights/formatting based on semantic entity links.
        *   Inserting comments associated with semantic entities.
        *   Displaying annotations as tooltips or sidebars linked to entities.
    *   **Output:** Rendered document layer customized according to the layer configuration. The rendering engine supports displaying the original document with selected annotations applied.

**4.  API Endpoints:**

*   `/annotate`: Receives coordinate-based annotations. Stores annotation metadata and links to semantic entities.
*   `/layer`:  Creates and retrieves document layers based on annotation sets.
*   `/render`: Renders a document layer.

**Pseudocode (Layer Rendering):**

```
function renderLayer(document, layerConfig, annotationData):
    taggedDocument = applySemanticTags(document)
    selectedAnnotations = getAnnotationsForLayer(layerConfig, annotationData)

    renderedDocument = createDocument()

    for each sentence in taggedDocument:
        renderedSentence = createSentence()

        for each word in sentence:
            annotation = findAnnotationForWord(word, selectedAnnotations)

            if annotation:
                applyAnnotationStyle(word, annotation) # highlight, comment, etc.
            
            appendWordToSentence(renderedSentence, word)
        
        appendSentenceToDocument(renderedDocument, renderedSentence)

    return renderedDocument
```

**Innovation:**  This goes beyond simple coordinate-based highlighting. It introduces *semantic awareness* to the annotation process, enabling annotations to survive document revisions and layout changes. Layered document reconstruction allows for creating highly customized views tailored to specific tasks or audiences. This is useful for complex documents with many stakeholders.
