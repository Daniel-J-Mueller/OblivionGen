## Personalized Content "Mood" Adjustment

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** "Mood Engine" - a machine learning model trained on multimodal data (user biometrics, content analysis, contextual data).
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   **User Biometrics:** Real-time data from wearable sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial expressions via device camera).
    *   **Content Analysis:** Real-time analysis of displayed content (image/video aesthetics - color palettes, motion, objects; text sentiment analysis, topic modeling).
    *   **Contextual Data:** Time of day, location (coarse-grained), recent user activity (apps used, searches performed).
*   **Output:** "Mood Profile" - a dynamic vector representing the user's current emotional state (e.g., calm, energetic, anxious, focused).
*   **Integration:** Works as a module within the existing network content delivery system (as described in the provided patent).  Intercepts content *before* display.
*   **Alternative Message System Override:** Extends the existing alternative message system to include *dynamic* message selection and modification.

**Innovation Description:**

Instead of static alternative images/messages, this system dynamically adjusts content *aesthetic properties* based on the user's detected mood. It can modify color grading, brightness/contrast, saturation, background music, animation styles, and even subtly alter text phrasing to align with the user’s current emotional state.

**Detailed Operation:**

1.  **Mood Detection:** The Mood Engine continuously monitors user biometrics, content features, and contextual data to generate a real-time Mood Profile.

2.  **Content Analysis:** The system analyzes incoming content *before* display. This includes extracting visual features (colors, textures, motion), textual features (sentiment, keywords), and audio features (tempo, instrumentation).

3.  **Mood Alignment:** The system compares the Mood Profile to the content features. If there is a mismatch (e.g., user is anxious, content is fast-paced and aggressive), the system adjusts the content to better align with the user's mood.

4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Content adjustments can include:
    *   **Color Grading:** Softening colors for a calmer mood, increasing vibrancy for an energetic mood.
    *   **Animation Style:**  Switching from fast cuts to slow fades, or vice versa.
    *   **Background Music:**  Selecting music with a tempo and instrumentation that complements the user’s mood.
    *   **Text Phrasing:**  Subtly altering wording to be more positive or calming.  (e.g. replacing “problem” with “challenge”)
    *   **Alternative Image Insertion:**  If a drastic shift is needed, the system can dynamically insert alternative images or short video clips that are more aligned with the user's mood. This is an extension of the existing system, but with real-time, data-driven selection.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION adjustContent(content, moodProfile):
  contentFeatures = analyzeContent(content)
  moodDifference = calculateMoodDifference(moodProfile, contentFeatures)

  IF moodDifference > threshold:
    adjustmentParameters = determineAdjustmentParameters(moodDifference)

    adjustedContent = applyAdjustments(content, adjustmentParameters)
    RETURN adjustedContent
  ELSE:
    RETURN content
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION applyAdjustments(content, adjustmentParameters):
  // Adjust color grading, animation style, background music, text phrasing
  // Use machine learning models to ensure smooth and natural transitions
  //  Models trained on examples of content modified for different moods
  // Also incorporate alternative images/videos as needed
  // Return the adjusted content
  //(Implementation specific to content type: image, video, text, etc.)
  RETURN adjustedContent
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Personalized Presets:** Allow users to define their preferred mood adjustments for different content types (e.g., news, social media, gaming).
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system learns from user feedback to improve the accuracy of mood detection and adjustment.
*   **Cross-Device Synchronization:** Synchronize mood profiles across multiple devices.
*   **Integration with Smart Home Devices:** Adjust ambient lighting and sound to complement the content and user's mood.
