## Dynamic Resource Prefetching Based on Predicted User Interaction

**Concept:** Instead of passively waiting for reloads, proactively anticipate user needs *within* a page load and prefetch resources likely to be requested, leveraging client-side interaction data *before* a reload is even triggered. This moves beyond simple caching towards predictive loading.

**Specs:**

1.  **Client-Side Instrumentation:** Inject JavaScript into the rendered web page. This script will track micro-interactions:
    *   Mouse movements (heatmaps, dwell time on elements).
    *   Scrolling behavior (speed, direction, pauses).
    *   Element visibility (time an element is in the viewport).
    *   Initial text selection.
    *   Form field focus/blur events.
2.  **Interaction Vector Generation:** The client-side script creates a "Interaction Vector" â€“ a numerical representation of user behavior on the page.  This vector will be a weighted sum of the tracked micro-interactions.  Weights can be adjusted dynamically based on A/B testing.
3.  **Predictive Model:** A server-side machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network) is trained on historical Interaction Vectors and the subsequent resources requested by users (URLs, API endpoints, etc.). The model predicts the probability of each resource being requested *given* the current Interaction Vector.
4.  **Prefetch Trigger:** When the Interaction Vector reaches a certain threshold (indicating strong likelihood of a specific action), the client-side script initiates a low-priority prefetch request for the predicted resources.  Prefetch requests use HTTP Link headers (e.g. `<link rel="prefetch" href="...">`) to maximize browser caching efficiency.
5.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**  The server-side model continuously learns and adjusts the weights assigned to different micro-interactions.  This allows the system to adapt to changing user behavior and optimize prefetching accuracy.
6.  **Server-Side Interaction Logging:**  Capture initial Interaction Vectors for new users. This 'cold start' data helps the model learn user preferences quickly.
7.  **Prefetch Prioritization:** Implement a tiered prefetch system:
    *   **Tier 1 (High Priority):** Resources with a prediction probability > 80%. These are prefetched aggressively.
    *   **Tier 2 (Medium Priority):** Resources with a prediction probability between 50% and 80%. These are prefetched with lower priority.
    *   **Tier 3 (Low Priority):** Resources with a prediction probability between 20% and 50%. Prefetching is delayed or disabled.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function trackInteraction(event) {
  // Process event data (mouse movements, scrolling, etc.)
  // Update Interaction Vector
}

function sendInteractionVector() {
  // Send Interaction Vector to server
  // Receive predicted resources
}

function prefetchResources(resources) {
  for (resource in resources) {
    createLinkTag(resource); // Create <link rel="prefetch"> tag
  }
}

// Event Listeners
addEventListener("mousemove", trackInteraction);
addEventListener("scroll", trackInteraction);
addEventListener("focus", trackInteraction);
addEventListener("blur", trackInteraction);

// Initial setup
sendInteractionVector();
prefetchResources(predictedResources);
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced page load times.
*   Improved user experience.
*   Lower server load.
*   More accurate prediction of user needs.
