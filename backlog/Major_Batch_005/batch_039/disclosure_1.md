## Dynamic File Reconstruction via Distributed Hashing

**Concept:** Extend the peer-to-peer file sharing by incorporating a system where the file isn’t simply *shared*, but dynamically *reconstructed* from distributed hash fragments held by peers. This provides resilience against data corruption, enables a form of distributed storage, and unlocks potential for collaborative editing exceeding simple modifications.

**Specifications:**

**1. File Fragmentation & Hashing:**

*   **Algorithm:** Utilize a robust hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-3) to break the original file into a series of fixed-size fragments.
*   **Redundancy:** Generate multiple redundant fragments per original fragment. Number of redundant fragments is configurable (default: 3).
*   **Distribution:** Distribute these fragments across participating peers. Distribution isn’t necessarily even; peers can hold varying numbers of fragments. A distributed hash table (DHT) will map fragment IDs to peer locations.
*   **Metadata:** A central (but redundant) metadata server stores information about the file (original filename, size, hash, list of fragment IDs, redundancy scheme). This server doesn’t store the fragments themselves.

**2. Peer Interaction & Reconstruction:**

*   **Request Process:** When a user requests a file, the system contacts the metadata server to retrieve the list of fragment IDs and corresponding peer locations.
*   **Parallel Download:** The system initiates parallel downloads of fragments from multiple peers.
*   **Verification:** Upon receiving a fragment, the system verifies its integrity using the original file hash and the fragment ID. Corrupted fragments are discarded and re-requested from another peer.
*   **Reconstruction:** Once all necessary fragments (including redundant ones for verification) are received, the system reconstructs the original file.

**3. Collaborative Editing & Versioning:**

*   **Fragment Ownership:** Assign 'ownership' of specific fragments to users.
*   **Fragment Modification:**  Users modify fragments they own.
*   **Change Propagation:**  Changes to fragments are propagated to other peers holding that fragment.  A version control system (similar to Git) tracks changes within each fragment.
*   **Conflict Resolution:**  When multiple users modify the same fragment concurrently, a conflict resolution mechanism (e.g., last-write-wins, three-way merge) resolves the conflicts.
*   **Full Reconstruction:** A new 'golden' master is reconstructed from these fragments whenever a full synchronization occurs.

**4. System Architecture**

*   **DHT Implementation:** Use a distributed hash table (DHT) like Chord or Kademlia to efficiently map fragment IDs to peer locations.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Utilize a peer-to-peer protocol (e.g., WebRTC) for direct communication between peers.
*   **Metadata Server:** Implement a redundant metadata server using a consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft) to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
*   **API:** Expose an API for developers to integrate the system into their applications.

**Pseudocode (Fragment Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructFile(filename):
  metadata = getMetadata(filename)
  fragmentList = metadata.fragmentList
  requiredFragments = fragmentList + redundantFragments (based on metadata)
  downloadedFragments = {}

  for fragmentId in requiredFragments:
    peerLocation = DHT.lookup(fragmentId)
    fragment = downloadFragment(peerLocation, fragmentId)
    if verifyFragment(fragment, fragmentId):
      downloadedFragments[fragmentId] = fragment
    else:
      # Retry download from another peer
      pass

  if len(downloadedFragments) == len(requiredFragments):
    reconstructedFile = assembleFile(downloadedFragments)
    return reconstructedFile
  else:
    return error("Failed to reconstruct file")
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt fragments before distribution for enhanced security.
*   **Dynamic Redundancy:** Adjust the level of redundancy based on the importance of the data.
*   **Content Addressable Storage:**  Use content addressing (e.g., IPFS) to identify and retrieve fragments.
*   **Incentive Mechanisms:** Reward peers for storing and sharing fragments.
