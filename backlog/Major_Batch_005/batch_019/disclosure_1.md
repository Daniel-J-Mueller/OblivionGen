## Dynamic Patch Provenance & Attestation System

**Concept:** Extend the patch signing and verification process to include a dynamic, tamper-evident provenance record for *every* modification, creating a chain of trust that extends beyond simple signature validation. This shifts from verifying *that* a patch is signed by an authorized entity, to *how* and *why* a patch was created and applied, and who was involved at each step.

**Specs:**

**1. Patch Creation & Metadata Embedding:**

*   **Provenance Data Structure:** Define a standardized data structure (e.g., JSON Schema) for embedding provenance metadata *within* the patch file itself.  This includes:
    *   `creation_timestamp`:  UTC timestamp of patch creation.
    *   `creator_identity`:  Digital identity (e.g., X.509 certificate, DID) of the patch author.
    *   `reason_for_patch`: Human-readable description of the bug fix, security update, or feature addition.
    *   `affected_components`: List of specific code modules or components modified by the patch.
    *   `patch_diff`:  Standard patch format (e.g., unified diff) showing the code changes.
    *   `build_environment`: Hash of the build environment (compiler, libraries, OS) used to create the patch.
    *   `validation_tests`: Hash of the test suite used to validate the patch.
    *   `attestation_signatures`: List of signatures from authorized parties (e.g., security reviewers, compliance officers) attesting to the patch's quality and security.
*   **Patch Signing Process:**  The patch creation tool must:
    *   Collect provenance metadata from the developer and security review processes.
    *   Embed the metadata into the patch file.
    *   Sign the entire patch file (including metadata) with the developer's private key.
    *   Allow for appending of further attestation signatures during the release process.

**2.  Runtime Attestation Service:**

*   **Attestation Agent:** A component embedded within the patching system (or running as a separate service) responsible for:
    *   Receiving the signed patch file.
    *   Verifying the developer's signature on the patch file.
    *   Extracting the embedded provenance metadata.
    *   Querying a distributed ledger (see below) to verify the authenticity of the developer and any attesting parties.
    *   Applying the patch *only if* all signatures and metadata are valid and the developer is authorized.
*   **Distributed Ledger:** A blockchain or DAG-based ledger used to store:
    *   Developer identities (public keys, certificates).
    *   Attestation identities (public keys, certificates).
    *   Records of patch approvals and attestations.
    *   Audit trails of patch deployments.
*   **Policy Engine:**  A rules engine that determines whether a patch is allowed to be applied based on:
    *   The patch author.
    *   The patch reason.
    *   The affected components.
    *   The user's role or permissions.
    *   The current system state.

**3. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
function apply_patch(patch_file, system_state):
    // 1. Verify Signature
    if !verify_signature(patch_file, developer_public_key):
        return ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE

    // 2. Extract Metadata
    metadata = extract_metadata(patch_file)

    // 3. Verify Identities
    developer_valid = verify_identity(metadata.creator_identity, distributed_ledger)
    if !developer_valid:
        return ERROR_INVALID_DEVELOPER

    // 4. Validate Metadata
    if !validate_metadata(metadata):
        return ERROR_INVALID_METADATA

    // 5. Policy Check
    allowed = policy_engine.evaluate(metadata, system_state)
    if !allowed:
        return ERROR_POLICY_DENIED

    // 6. Apply Patch
    modified_code = apply_patch_to_code(system_state.code, patch_file)

    // 7. Update System State
    system_state.code = modified_code
    system_state.patch_provenance = metadata //Store for audit purposes

    // 8. Return Success
    return SUCCESS
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond simple signature validation to create a comprehensive provenance record for every patch, increasing trust and accountability. It allows for fine-grained control over patch deployment, enabling organizations to enforce strict security and compliance policies.  The distributed ledger provides an immutable audit trail, making it easier to investigate security incidents and demonstrate compliance with regulations.
