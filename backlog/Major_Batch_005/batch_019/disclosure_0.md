## Dynamic Network Document Composition via Predictive Prefetching & Segment Swapping

**Concept:** Extend the inline customization concept to proactively assemble network documents *before* user request, predicting likely customizations and pre-fetching/pre-rendering segments. This allows for near-instantaneous display of customized documents, even with complex modifications.  Instead of responding to a request, the system anticipates and prepares.

**Specs:**

*   **Segment Granularity:** Network documents are broken down into independently addressable segments â€“ not just visual blocks, but functional units (e.g., a comment section, a product listing, a news headline). These segments have unique IDs.
*   **User Profile & History:** Each user has a profile tracking customization preferences (e.g., preferred font sizes, color schemes, content filters, layout preferences).  Also tracked is a history of segment swaps/modifications performed by the user.
*   **Predictive Engine:** A machine learning model analyzes user profiles, browsing history, current URL/document structure, and real-time data (time of day, location, trending topics) to predict likely customizations.
*   **Prefetch Queue:** Based on predictions, the system maintains a prefetch queue of segment variations. These variations are fetched and rendered in the background.  The queue prioritizes segments with high prediction scores and low cache hit rates.
*   **Segment Swapping Mechanism:** When a user interacts with a document, the system intercepts the modification request (as in the original patent) *but* checks if the requested customization is already available in the prefetch queue. If so, the segment is swapped in instantly. If not, the system falls back to the original inline customization process.
*   **Dynamic Assembly Layer:** A layer sits between the network document source and the browser. This layer dynamically assembles the document from prefetched segments and inline customizations.
*   **Caching:** Aggressive caching of prefetched segments and assembled documents.
*   **Real-Time Update Channel:** A WebSockets connection allows the server to push updated segment variations to the client in real-time, anticipating future customizations.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Assembly Layer):**

```
function assembleDocument(url, userProfile) {
  document = fetchBaseDocument(url);
  predictedCustomizations = predictCustomizations(userProfile, document);

  for (customization in predictedCustomizations) {
    segmentId = customization.segmentId;
    newSegment = fetchPrefetchedSegment(segmentId, customization.variation);

    if (newSegment) {
      document.replaceSegment(segmentId, newSegment);
    } else {
      // Fallback to inline customization if prefetch fails
      applyInlineCustomization(customization, document);
    }
  }

  return document;
}

function fetchPrefetchedSegment(segmentId, variation) {
  // Check local cache
  if (cacheHit(segmentId, variation)) {
    return cache.get(segmentId, variation);
  }

  // Check prefetch queue
  if (prefetchQueue.contains(segmentId, variation)) {
    return prefetchQueue.get(segmentId, variation);
  }

  return null; // Not found
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Personalized news feeds with dynamically updated headlines and articles.
*   E-commerce sites with product listings tailored to individual preferences.
*   Social media platforms with customized content streams.
*   Accessibility features for users with disabilities.
