## Adaptive Resonance Inventory System - ARIS

**Concept:** Expand the sensor suite and diagnostic capabilities to incorporate principles of Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance *within* the inventory system itself.  This moves beyond simple operational checks to a system that ‘learns’ the normal behavior of inventory items and alerts to subtle deviations *before* failure.

**Specs:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion:**
    *   **Weight Sensor Enhancement:**  Existing weight sensors are retained. Add a micro-vibration sensor (MEMS accelerometer) directly coupled to the weighing platform. This detects subtle changes in resonant frequency due to material degradation or internal shifts *within* the item being weighed.
    *   **Acoustic Emission Sensors:**  Integrate small acoustic emission sensors into the shelf frame, focused on the inventory location. These detect high-frequency sound waves emitted by developing cracks, friction, or material stress.
    *   **Thermal Imaging:**  Low-resolution thermal cameras positioned to scan inventory locations. Detects heat signatures indicative of component failure, chemical reactions, or energy loss.
    *   **Spectroscopic Analysis (Optional):**  For certain high-value items, a miniature Raman spectrometer could be integrated to analyze material composition and detect subtle changes.

2.  **ART-Based Anomaly Detection Module:**
    *   **Data Preprocessing:** Raw sensor data is fed into a preprocessing stage for noise reduction, normalization, and feature extraction (e.g., resonant frequency, vibration amplitude, thermal gradient, acoustic emission rate).
    *   **ART Network:** A modified ART network (specifically, ARTMAP) is implemented on an embedded processing unit within the shelf. The network is trained with baseline sensor data for each inventory item during initial placement.
    *   **Vigilance Parameter:** The vigilance parameter in the ART network is dynamically adjusted based on item criticality and historical failure rates.  Higher vigilance for critical items.
    *   **Anomaly Scoring:** When sensor data deviates significantly from the learned pattern, the ART network generates an anomaly score.
    *   **Thresholding & Alerting:**  Anomaly scores exceeding a predefined threshold trigger an alert to the inventory management system. Alerts include the anomaly score, sensor data, and a potential failure mode prediction.

3.  **Predictive Maintenance Engine:**
    *   **Historical Data Logging:** All sensor data and anomaly scores are logged to a central database.
    *   **Trend Analysis:** Machine learning algorithms (e.g., time series analysis, recurrent neural networks) are used to identify long-term trends in sensor data and predict future failures.
    *   **Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Estimation:** The system estimates the RUL of inventory items based on current sensor data, historical trends, and predicted failure rates.
    *   **Proactive Maintenance Scheduling:** The system automatically schedules proactive maintenance tasks (e.g., inspection, repair, replacement) to minimize downtime and prevent catastrophic failures.

4.  **Communication Protocol:**
    *   **Wireless Mesh Network:** Each shelf communicates with neighboring shelves and a central gateway via a low-power wireless mesh network (e.g., Zigbee, Bluetooth Mesh).
    *   **MQTT Protocol:** Data is transmitted to the central inventory management system using the MQTT protocol.
    *   **API Integration:**  An open API allows integration with existing inventory management systems, ERP systems, and other business applications.

**Pseudocode (ART Network Update):**

```
function updateARTNetwork(sensorData, itemID) {
  // Preprocess sensor data
  processedData = preprocess(sensorData);

  // Forward pass through ART network
  category = ARTForwardPass(processedData);

  // If new pattern detected (category is undefined)
  if (category == undefined) {
    // Create new category in ART network
    newCategory = ARTCreateNewCategory(processedData);

    // Associate category with itemID
    ARTAssociateCategoryWithItemID(newCategory, itemID);

    //Return newCategory
    return newCategory
  } else {
    // Update weights in ART network based on processedData
    ARTUpdateWeights(category, processedData);
    //Return category
    return category
  }
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The ART network can be implemented using a variety of software frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   The choice of sensors and algorithms will depend on the specific types of inventory items being monitored.
*   The system should be designed to be scalable and adaptable to changing inventory needs.
