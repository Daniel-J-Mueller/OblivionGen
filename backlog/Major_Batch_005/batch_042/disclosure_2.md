## Adaptive Replication Granularity Based on Query Complexity

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust replication granularity – moving beyond table-level replication to replication at the *query* level – based on real-time analysis of incoming queries.

**Core Concept:** Instead of replicating entire tables, the system identifies the precise data *required* by frequent and complex queries. Replication then focuses on these specific data subsets, minimizing replication overhead and maximizing performance for those crucial queries.  

**Components:**

1.  **Query Interceptor:** Sits between application/user and the database. Captures all incoming queries (or a statistically significant sample).
2.  **Query Analyzer:** Parses intercepted queries, identifying:
    *   Tables accessed.
    *   Columns accessed within each table.
    *   Filtering conditions (WHERE clauses).
    *   Join conditions.
    *   Query complexity score (based on the number of joins, subqueries, etc.).
3.  **Replication Granularity Manager:**
    *   Monitors Query Analyzer output.
    *   Maintains a “Replication Map” – a dynamic mapping between queries (or query patterns) and the minimal data subsets required for their execution.
    *   Communicates with the Replication Engine to create and manage granular replication streams.
4.  **Replication Engine:**  Handles the actual replication process, supporting:
    *   Full table replication (as a fallback or for infrequently accessed data).
    *   Row-level replication (replicating only rows matching specific criteria).
    *   Column-level replication (replicating only specific columns).
    *   Materialized View Replication: Replicates pre-computed results of complex queries as materialized views on the replica.
5.  **Drift Detection & Synchronization:** Monitors data drift between source and replica at the granular level. Employs techniques like logical timestamps or version vectors to ensure consistency.

**Pseudocode (Replication Granularity Manager):**

```
function process_query(query):
  query_complexity = analyze_query(query)
  required_data = extract_required_data(query)

  if query_complexity > threshold AND required_data not in Replication_Map:
    create_granular_replication_stream(required_data)
    add_to_Replication_Map(query, required_data)
  else if query_complexity <= threshold:
    // Use existing full table replication or fallback strategy
    use_full_table_replication()
  else:
    // Use existing granular replication stream for this query
    use_existing_replication(query)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Replication Map:**  `Dictionary<Query, DataSubset>` where:
    *   `Query`:  A normalized representation of the query (e.g., hash of query string, abstract syntax tree).
    *   `DataSubset`:  A description of the minimal data required to execute the query.  Could include: table name, list of columns, filtering conditions.

**Novelty/Differentiation:**

Existing replication systems focus on table or row-level granularity. This system extends that to the *query* level, enabling significantly more efficient replication for complex analytical workloads. The dynamic adjustment of replication granularity based on query complexity is also a key innovation. It addresses the problem of replicating unnecessary data for frequently executed, complex queries.
