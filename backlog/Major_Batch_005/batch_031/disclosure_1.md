## Aerial Bioluminescence Detection & Mapping System

**System Overview:** A drone-based system leveraging high-sensitivity, multi-spectral cameras and advanced image processing to detect and map bioluminescent organisms in the environment. This expands the weather/environmental data gathered by the existing patent to include biological activity, providing insights into ecosystem health, pollution levels, and even potential early warning systems for harmful algal blooms.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Drone Platform:** Heavy-lift UAV capable of supporting a multi-payload system (minimum 5kg capacity). Redundant flight control systems and extended battery life (minimum 60 minutes flight time).
*   **Primary Camera:** High-sensitivity, low-light monochrome camera (resolution: 12MP or greater) with a spectral range extending into the blue-green spectrum (400-550nm) - optimized for bioluminescence detection. Global shutter preferred.
*   **Secondary Camera:** Multi-spectral camera (5 bands: blue, green, red, NIR, thermal) for environmental context and classification of vegetation/land cover.
*   **Light Source (Optional):** Narrow-band blue light LED array for controlled stimulation of bioluminescence (for calibration & boosting signal in low-activity areas – use sparingly to minimize disturbance).
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) / GPS:** High-precision IMU and GPS unit for accurate georeferencing of collected data.
*   **Onboard Processor:** Embedded system (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) capable of real-time image processing and data logging.
*   **Data Storage:** High-capacity solid-state drive (minimum 512GB).

**Software Specifications:**

*   **Flight Planning Software:** Automated flight path planning with customizable altitude, speed, and camera trigger settings. Incorporate terrain following capability.
*   **Image Pre-processing:**
    *   Dark frame subtraction to reduce thermal noise.
    *   Flat-field correction to compensate for sensor variations.
    *   Geometric correction & orthorectification using IMU/GPS data.
*   **Bioluminescence Detection Algorithm:**
    *   Adaptive thresholding based on background noise levels.
    *   Morphological filtering to remove spurious detections.
    *   Object-based image analysis (OBIA) to identify bioluminescent patches.
*   **Data Fusion:** Integrate bioluminescence data with multi-spectral imagery and environmental data (temperature, humidity, wind speed) for comprehensive analysis.
*   **Mapping & Visualization:** Create high-resolution maps of bioluminescent distribution and intensity.  Visualization tools for analyzing trends and patterns.
*    **Anomaly Detection:** Algorithm to identify unusual bioluminescent patterns – potentially indicating pollution events, or other environmental stressors.
*   **Realtime Data Transmission:** Capability to transmit processed data to a ground station in real-time for immediate analysis and decision-making.

**Operational Procedure (Pseudocode):**

```
// Initialization
Drone.Initialize()
Camera.Initialize()
GPS.Initialize()
IMU.Initialize()

// Flight Planning
FlightPath = GenerateFlightPath(AreaOfInterest, Altitude, Speed)

// Data Acquisition Loop
FOR each Point in FlightPath:
    Drone.NavigateTo(Point)
    Camera.CaptureImage()
    GPS.GetLocation()
    IMU.GetData()
    Data.Save(Image, Location, IMUData)
ENDFOR

// Data Processing
FOR each DataPoint in Data:
    Image = DataPoint.Image
    PreprocessedImage = PreprocessImage(Image)
    BioluminescenceMap = DetectBioluminescence(PreprocessedImage)
    GeoreferencedMap = GeoreferenceMap(BioluminescenceMap, DataPoint.Location)
    Data.Save(GeoreferencedMap)
ENDFOR

// Analysis & Visualization
GenerateReport(Data)
VisualizeData(Data)
```

**Novelty:**  The system extends environmental monitoring capabilities beyond traditional meteorological data to include biological activity. Detecting bioluminescence offers a non-invasive way to assess ecosystem health, identify pollution sources, and potentially predict environmental changes. The integration of multi-spectral imagery and real-time data transmission enhances the system's analytical and predictive capabilities.
