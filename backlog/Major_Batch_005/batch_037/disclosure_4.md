## Dynamic Shard Prioritization & Predictive Migration

**Concept:** Extend the shard spreading/pruning system with a predictive component. Instead of *reacting* to under/over-utilization, *predict* future imbalances based on access patterns, anticipated growth, and infrastructure health. Introduce a prioritization scheme for shards – not all shards are equal. Some contain critical metadata or frequently accessed data, demanding preferential placement.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Migration & Prioritization Manager (PMPM).  Runs as a separate service alongside the Redundancy Reduction Manager.
*   **Data Input:**
    *   Real-time access logs for each data object.
    *   Historical access patterns (aggregated & anonymized).
    *   Infrastructure health metrics (CPU, network latency, disk I/O) for each availability zone.
    *   Data object metadata (size, creation date, modification frequency, defined criticality level – see below).
*   **Data Object Criticality Levels:** Define three levels:
    *   **High:** Critical metadata, frequently accessed core data.  Must be available with minimal latency.
    *   **Medium:** Important data, accessed regularly.
    *   **Low:** Archival data, infrequently accessed.
*   **Prediction Algorithm:** A time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) trained on historical access patterns.  Predicts future access rates for each data object shard. Incorporates infrastructure health predictions.
*   **Shard Prioritization:** Assigns a priority score to each shard based on:
    *   Data object criticality level.
    *   Predicted access rate.
    *   Current availability zone health.
*   **Migration Strategy:**
    *   **Proactive Migration:** Based on predictions, move high-priority shards *before* an availability zone becomes overloaded.  Prioritize movement to zones with optimal health and low latency.
    *   **Dynamic Shard Balancing:**  Continuously monitor shard distribution and adjust placement to maintain a balanced load across availability zones.
    *   **Tiered Storage Integration:**  If a low-priority shard is predicted to be accessed infrequently for an extended period, move it to a cheaper, slower storage tier (e.g., cold storage).
*   **Pseudocode (PMPM core loop):**

```
FOR EACH data_object IN data_objects:
    access_predictions = predict_access_patterns(data_object)
    shard_priorities = calculate_shard_priorities(data_object, access_predictions)
    
    FOR EACH shard IN data_object.shards:
        current_zone = shard.location
        best_zone = find_best_zone(shard, shard_priorities, infrastructure_health)
        
        IF current_zone != best_zone:
            move_shard(shard, best_zone)

```

*   **Infrastructure Integration:** PMPM communicates with the Redundancy Reduction Manager to coordinate shard movements and ensure durability constraints are maintained.
*   **Alerting:** Generate alerts if predicted imbalances are severe or if infrastructure failures are imminent.
*   **Configuration:** Adjustable parameters for prediction horizon, migration thresholds, and alert sensitivity.
