**Adaptive Purchasing Opportunity ‘Ecosystem’ Mapping**

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of identifying similar purchasing opportunities not just by keyword similarity, but by mapping a dynamic ‘ecosystem’ of related products, suppliers, and even market trends. This shifts from a document-centric approach to a relationship-centric one.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Input: Distinguished purchasing opportunity document (as in the patent).
    *   Augmented Input: Real-time web scraping of supplier websites, industry news feeds, social media (specifically product review sites), and public datasets (e.g., commodity pricing).
    *   Data Structure:  A graph database (Neo4j or similar). Nodes represent:
        *   Products (SKUs, descriptions, images)
        *   Suppliers (company name, location, contact info)
        *   Attributes (technical specs, materials, certifications)
        *   Trends (identified from news/social media – ‘rising demand for sustainable packaging’, ‘chip shortage impacting lead times’)
        *   Purchasing Opportunities (the documents themselves)
    *   Edges represent relationships:
        *   ‘Supplies’ (Supplier -> Product)
        *   ‘IsA’ (Product -> Category)
        *   ‘RelatedTo’ (Product -> Product - based on co-occurrence in purchasing requests, technical similarity)
        *   ‘InfluencedBy’ (Product -> Trend)

2.  **Ecosystem Construction:**
    *   Algorithm:  Initial ecosystem seeded from the distinguished purchasing opportunity.
    *   Expansion:  Iteratively expand the graph by:
        *   Identifying related products based on attribute similarity and co-occurrence.
        *   Finding suppliers for those related products.
        *   Detecting relevant trends impacting the ecosystem (using NLP on news/social media).
        *   Weighting edges based on strength of relationship (e.g., frequency of co-occurrence, number of shared attributes).

3.  **Similarity Scoring:**
    *   Instead of keyword-based scores, use graph similarity algorithms:
        *   **Node2Vec/Graph Embedding:** Generate vector representations of nodes in the ecosystem.
        *   **Graph Edit Distance:** Measure the minimum number of edits required to transform one ecosystem into another.
        *   **Common Neighbor Count:** Identify purchasing opportunities sharing a high number of common suppliers/products/trends in their ecosystems.
    *   Score = f(Graph Similarity Score, Trend Alignment Score) – higher scores indicate greater ecosystem similarity.

4.  **Dynamic Adaptation:**
    *   Real-time monitoring of the ecosystem:
        *   Price fluctuations
        *   Supplier disruptions
        *   Emerging trends
    *   Automatic adjustment of similarity scores and ecosystem mapping.
    *   Alerts for significant changes impacting purchasing decisions.

5.  **User Interface:**
    *   Visual graph representation of the purchasing opportunity ecosystem.
    *   Interactive exploration of relationships between products, suppliers, and trends.
    *   Filtering and highlighting of key insights.
    *   Recommendations for alternative suppliers or products.

**Pseudocode (Ecosystem Expansion):**

```
function expand_ecosystem(distinguished_opportunity, depth):
  ecosystem = initialize_ecosystem(distinguished_opportunity)
  queue = [distinguished_opportunity]

  for i in range(depth):
    next_level = []
    for node in queue:
      # Find related products
      related_products = find_related_products(node)
      ecosystem.add_nodes(related_products)
      ecosystem.add_edges(node, related_products, relation="related_to")

      # Find suppliers for related products
      suppliers = find_suppliers(related_products)
      ecosystem.add_nodes(suppliers)
      ecosystem.add_edges(related_products, suppliers, relation="supplies")

      # Find relevant trends
      trends = find_relevant_trends(related_products)
      ecosystem.add_nodes(trends)
      ecosystem.add_edges(related_products, trends, relation="influenced_by")

      next_level.extend(related_products + suppliers + trends)

    queue = next_level

  return ecosystem
