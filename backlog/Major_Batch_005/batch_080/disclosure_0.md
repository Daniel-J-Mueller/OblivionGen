## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Display Arrays

**Concept:** Extend the priority content display system with localized haptic feedback, dynamically adjusting intensity and pattern based on content priority *and* user gaze/focus.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of displays (as per base patent).
    *   Integrated array of micro-haptic actuators – small, localized vibration/texture generators positioned *directly behind* each display panel or within the bezel. Resolution of actuators should match or exceed display pixel density for nuanced feedback.
    *   Eye-tracking hardware integrated into each display or a central tracking system capable of determining user gaze position across the display array.
    *   Processing unit capable of real-time data fusion – combining content priority data, gaze tracking data, and haptic actuator control.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Priority Mapping:** A system for assigning haptic intensity/patterns to content priority levels. (e.g., High Priority = strong, patterned vibration; Low Priority = minimal/no vibration).  This mapping is configurable and user-adjustable.
    *   **Gaze-Adaptive Haptics:** Algorithm that dynamically adjusts haptic feedback intensity and pattern *based on user gaze*. If the user is looking *at* a high-priority display, the haptic feedback is amplified. If the gaze is averted, the haptic feedback diminishes.  Consider a logarithmic scaling to avoid jarring transitions.
    *   **Content-Aware Haptics:**  Ability to analyze content *type* and generate appropriate haptic feedback. (e.g., Map data = textured "road" feel; Notification = sharp pulse; Video game = immersive vibrations tied to in-game events).  This requires a content analysis module.
    *   **User Profile & Learning:** System for storing user preferences for haptic intensity, patterns, and content-specific settings.  Machine learning component to *learn* user responses and adapt haptic feedback accordingly. (e.g. if the user consistently dismisses notifications with certain vibration patterns, the system will reduce the intensity or switch to a different pattern.)
*   **Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    // Get Content Priority for each display
    priorityData = GetContentPriority()

    // Get User Gaze Position
    gazeData = GetGazePosition()

    // Get User Preferences
    userPrefs = GetUserPreferences()

    FOR EACH display IN displayArray:
        contentPriority = priorityData[display]
        isGazedAt = isGazedAt(display, gazeData)

        baseHapticIntensity = GetHapticIntensity(contentPriority, userPrefs)

        IF isGazedAt:
            hapticIntensity = baseHapticIntensity * gazeMultiplier // gazeMultiplier > 1
        ELSE:
            hapticIntensity = baseHapticIntensity * reducedMultiplier // reducedMultiplier < 1

        // Apply content-aware adjustments
        hapticPattern = GetHapticPattern(content_type)

        // Send haptic signal to display's actuator array
        SendHapticSignal(display, hapticIntensity, hapticPattern)

    END LOOP
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced Notifications: Differentiate urgent notifications from background information.
*   Immersive Gaming:  Create a more tactile gaming experience.
*   Accessibility: Provide non-visual cues for users with visual impairments.
*   Data Visualization:  Translate data points into tactile patterns.
*   Prototyping/Design: Allow users to "feel" digital designs.
