## Dynamic Preference Decay with Contextual Boost

**Specification:** A system for modulating item recommendation weights based on a combination of recency, explicit user feedback, *and* environmental context.

**Core Concept:** Expand upon the existing recency weighting (claim 5) by introducing a contextual boost factor that amplifies or diminishes the weight of an item based on real-time environmental data.

**System Components:**

1.  **Environmental Data Input:** APIs to gather real-time data. Examples:
    *   **Weather:** Temperature, precipitation, humidity.
    *   **Location:** GPS coordinates, points of interest.
    *   **Time:** Hour of day, day of week, seasonality.
    *   **Social Trends:** Trending topics on social media platforms (via APIs).
    *   **News Feeds:** Current event categories (via APIs).

2.  **Contextual Mapping Engine:** A rules-based system (initially hand-crafted, eventually machine learned) to map environmental data to item categories and modify their weights.
    *   Example Rule: *IF* Temperature > 85Â°F *AND* User Location = Beach *THEN* Boost weight of "Sunglasses" and "Sunscreen" by 3x.
    *   Example Rule: *IF* User Location = Gym *AND* Time = 6:00 PM *THEN* Boost weight of "Protein Shakes" and "Workout Apparel" by 2x.
    *   Example Rule: *IF* Social Trend = "Hiking" *THEN* Boost weight of "Hiking Boots" and "Backpacks" by 1.5x.
    *   The system needs a fallback mechanism for scenarios where environmental data is unavailable or irrelevant.

3.  **Preference Decay & Boost Integration:** Modify the existing item weighting algorithm to incorporate both recency decay *and* contextual boosts:

    ```pseudocode
    function calculateItemWeight(item, userHistory, environmentalData) {
        // Existing Recency Weight Calculation (as per claim 5)
        recencyWeight = calculateRecencyWeight(item, userHistory);

        // Calculate Contextual Boost Factor
        boostFactor = 1.0; // Default boost
        for each environmentalCondition in environmentalData {
            if (environmentalCondition matches item category) {
                boostFactor *= getBoostFactorForCondition(environmentalCondition);
            }
        }

        // Combine Weights
        finalWeight = recencyWeight * boostFactor;
        return finalWeight;
    }
    ```

4.  **User Preference Learning:** Incorporate machine learning to dynamically refine the contextual mapping rules.
    *   Track user interactions with recommended items *in relation to* the environmental context.
    *   Use reinforcement learning or similar techniques to optimize the boost factors and rules over time.  The learning algorithm should prioritize maximizing click-through rates, purchase conversions, or other defined metrics.

5. **Multi-Tiered Contextual Boost:** Allow stacking of contextual boosts. For example, a user at the beach on a hot day might receive a boost for "Sunscreen" due to both "Temperature" *and* "Location".

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The system should be designed to handle a large volume of environmental data and user requests.
*   Caching and pre-computation can be used to improve performance.
*   A/B testing should be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different contextual rules and algorithms.
*   Privacy considerations related to location data must be addressed.
