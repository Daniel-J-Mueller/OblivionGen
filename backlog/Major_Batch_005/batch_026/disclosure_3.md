## Dynamic Transaction Prioritization & Predictive Disconnect

**Concept:** Extend the target port circuit's ability to manage outstanding transactions *before* a power down/reboot request is even received. Implement a system that *predicts* potential hangs and dynamically prioritizes transactions based on estimated completion time and dependency chains, proactively buffering critical data and minimizing the impact of forced disconnection.

**Specs:**

*   **Predictive Analysis Module (PAM):** Integrated into the target port circuit. Continuously monitors transaction types, data transfer sizes, and historical completion times. Uses this data to predict the duration of outstanding transactions. Implements a scoring system – “Criticality Score” – factoring in transaction dependency (e.g., write address before write data) and data importance (e.g., firmware updates vs. display refresh).

*   **Dynamic Buffering:** Based on the Criticality Score, PAM instructs the target port circuit to dynamically allocate buffer space. High-scoring transactions are given priority allocation, ensuring they are fully buffered *before* lower-scoring transactions. This minimizes data loss during disconnection. Buffer allocation is dynamic, resizing based on predictive analysis and available resources.

*   **Transaction Prioritization Engine (TPE):** Modifies AXI request scheduling. The TPE leverages the Criticality Score to re-order transactions, prioritizing high-scoring transactions. It communicates with the AXI interconnect fabric to influence scheduling decisions.  The TPE employs a "weighted fairness" algorithm to prevent starvation of lower-priority transactions while still favoring critical ones.

*   **Pre-Disconnect Data Flush:** Upon receiving a power down/reboot request, the PAM triggers a "pre-disconnect flush." This involves prioritizing the completion of buffered critical transactions.  It initiates a controlled data flush process, transmitting buffered data to the master device. 

*   **Graceful Disconnect Sequence:** Once the pre-disconnect flush is complete, the PAM initiates a graceful disconnect sequence. This involves disabling new transaction acceptance, completing existing buffered transactions, and then responding with error messages.

*   **Master Device Awareness (Optional):**  The target port circuit can transmit a "Warning" message to the master device *before* initiating the disconnect sequence, providing a short window for the master to prepare.

**Pseudocode (PAM core logic):**

```
function calculate_criticality_score(transaction):
    score = 0
    if transaction.type == "write_address":
        score += 10
    if transaction.dependency == "high":
        score += 5
    if transaction.data_importance == "critical":
        score += 15
    return score

function allocate_buffer_space(transaction, criticality_score):
    buffer_size = base_buffer_size + (criticality_score * buffer_scaling_factor)
    allocate memory[buffer_size]
    return memory_address

function monitor_transaction_completion(transaction):
    completion_time = current_time - transaction.start_time
    update historical_completion_time_data[transaction.type]
    
function adjust_buffer_scaling_factor():
    // Analyze historical completion time data to optimize buffer allocation
    //  and prevent buffer overflow or underutilization
    // Adjust buffer_scaling_factor based on analysis
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires additional buffer memory within the target port circuit.
*   Increased processing requirements for PAM and TPE.
*   Potential impact on latency due to transaction prioritization.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced data loss during power down/reboot.
*   Minimized system hangs and improved stability.
*   Enhanced reliability in critical applications.
*   Potentially enables faster reboot times.
