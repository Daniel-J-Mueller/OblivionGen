## Adaptive Resolution Streaming for Predictive Maintenance

**Concept:** Extend the prioritized data transfer concept to create a dynamic, adaptive resolution stream for real-time predictive maintenance of complex systems (e.g., aircraft engines, industrial robots). Instead of simply prioritizing coefficients, the system dynamically adjusts the *level of detail* transmitted based on predicted failure modes and current system state.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Source:** Multiple time series data streams from sensors monitoring critical system parameters (temperature, vibration, pressure, current draw, etc.).
*   **Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model (trained on historical data and failure analysis) predicts potential failure modes and assigns a "severity score" to each. The model also estimates a “time to event” (TTE) for each predicted failure.
*   **Coefficient Generation:** Apply a Wavelet Transform (or similar multi-resolution analysis) to each time series stream, creating multiple coefficient groups at different levels of detail.
*   **Adaptive Resolution Mapping:**  This is the core innovation. The system maps predicted failure modes and TTE to specific coefficient groups.
    *   *High Severity, Short TTE:* Transmit high-detail coefficient groups (fine-grained data) immediately for precise analysis.
    *   *Medium Severity, Medium TTE:* Transmit medium-detail coefficient groups with increased frequency.
    *   *Low Severity, Long TTE:*  Transmit low-detail (approximation) coefficients, or defer transmission entirely, prioritizing bandwidth for more critical streams.
*   **Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation:**  The system dynamically allocates bandwidth to each sensor stream based on its assigned priority, ensuring critical data reaches the analysis engine in a timely manner.  Employ a congestion control algorithm optimized for prioritized data streams.
*   **Compression & Encoding:** Apply lossless or near-lossless compression techniques to the coefficient data *before* transmission. Explore vector quantization or other encoding methods to further reduce bandwidth usage.
*   **Data Fusion & Analysis:** The receiving end (e.g., a central monitoring station) reconstructs the time series data from the received coefficient groups and applies advanced analytics to detect anomalies and predict failures.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  The prediction engine learns from the received data and adjusts its predictions and resolution mapping accordingly.  If a predicted failure doesn't materialize, the system can reduce the resolution of that stream.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Resolution Mapping):**

```
function map_resolution(predicted_failure_mode, time_to_event, sensor_data_type):
    severity = get_severity(predicted_failure_mode)
    if severity == "High" and time_to_event < threshold_1:
        resolution = "High Detail"
        transmission_frequency = "Real-Time"
    elif severity == "Medium" and time_to_event < threshold_2:
        resolution = "Medium Detail"
        transmission_frequency = "Increased"
    elif severity == "Low" and time_to_event > threshold_3:
        resolution = "Low Detail"
        transmission_frequency = "Reduced"
    else:
        resolution = "Default"
        transmission_frequency = "Standard"

    return resolution, transmission_frequency
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Edge computing devices at the sensor locations to perform wavelet transforms and adaptive resolution mapping.
*   High-bandwidth, low-latency communication network.
*   Powerful server infrastructure for data fusion and analysis.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced bandwidth consumption.
*   Improved predictive maintenance accuracy.
*   Increased system reliability.
*   Lower maintenance costs.
*   Early detection of potential failures.
