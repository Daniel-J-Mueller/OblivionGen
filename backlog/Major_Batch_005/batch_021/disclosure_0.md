## Dynamic Host Persona Creation & Migration

**Concept:** Extend the automated host recovery workflow to not simply *replace* a failed host with an identical one, but to dynamically create a "host persona" and migrate it to a potentially *different* hardware configuration. This moves beyond simple high availability and introduces adaptability and resource optimization.

**Specs:**

**1. Persona Definition:**

*   **Data Structure:**  A JSON-based "Persona Profile" containing:
    *   `required_cores`: Integer – Minimum CPU cores.
    *   `required_ram_gb`: Integer – Minimum RAM in GB.
    *   `required_storage_gb`: Integer – Minimum storage in GB.
    *   `software_stack`: List of strings – Required software packages (e.g., “nginx”, “python3”, “postgresql”).  Includes version numbers.
    *   `network_configuration`: Dictionary –  Network settings (IP address ranges, firewall rules, VLANs).
    *   `security_profile`: Dictionary – Security settings (user access controls, encryption keys).
    *   `application_dependencies`: List of strings – Names/IDs of other applications/services this persona depends on.
    *   `performance_metrics`: Dictionary – Target performance metrics (CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O).  Used for post-migration validation.
*   **Profile Storage:**  A centralized repository (e.g., etcd, Consul) storing Persona Profiles, indexed by application/service ID.

**2. Failure Detection & Persona Identification:**

*   **Enhanced Health Checks:** Existing health checks extended to capture more granular metrics relating to *application-level* health, not just OS/hardware.
*   **Persona Lookup:** Upon failure detection, the system queries the Persona Profile repository using the application/service ID running on the failed host.

**3. Dynamic Host Provisioning & Configuration:**

*   **Resource Broker:** A component responsible for identifying available hosts meeting the `required_cores`, `required_ram_gb`, `required_storage_gb` criteria.  Prioritizes hosts with the closest matching configuration.
*   **Configuration Orchestration:**  Uses a configuration management tool (Ansible, Puppet, Chef) to:
    *   Install the `software_stack` specified in the Persona Profile.
    *   Configure the `network_configuration`.
    *   Apply the `security_profile`.
    *   Deploy application code.
*   **Data Migration:**  Automated data migration from the failed host to the new host. This could involve:
    *   Volume snapshots and replication.
    *   Database replication.
    *   File synchronization.

**4. Validation & Switchover:**

*   **Automated Testing:** Run a suite of tests to verify that the new host is functioning correctly and meeting the `performance_metrics` defined in the Persona Profile.
*   **Traffic Redirection:**  Update DNS or load balancer configurations to redirect traffic to the new host.
*   **Monitoring & Feedback:** Continuously monitor the new host's performance and health.  Provide feedback to the Resource Broker to improve future host selection.

**5. Adaptive Persona Profiles**

*   **Performance Learning:** Monitor the performance of running personas to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
*   **Profile Updates:** Automatically adjust Persona Profiles based on observed performance data. This could involve increasing resource requirements or optimizing software configurations.
*   **A/B Testing:** Deploy new Persona Profiles to a small subset of hosts to evaluate their impact on performance and stability before rolling them out to the entire infrastructure.

**Pseudocode (Simplified)**

```
function handleHostFailure(failedHost) {
  personaProfile = getPersonaProfile(failedHost.applicationId)
  availableHost = resourceBroker.findHost(personaProfile.requiredResources)
  if (availableHost) {
    configurationOrchestrator.configureHost(availableHost, personaProfile)
    dataMigrationService.migrateData(failedHost, availableHost)
    validationService.validateHost(availableHost, personaProfile.performanceMetrics)
    trafficRedirector.redirectTraffic(failedHost, availableHost)
    monitoringService.monitorHost(availableHost)
  } else {
    // Handle case where no suitable host is available
    // (e.g., provision a new host)
  }
}
```

This approach transforms the automated recovery system from a simple replacement mechanism to a dynamic, adaptable infrastructure management system capable of optimizing resource utilization and improving application performance.
