## Adaptive Keypoint Weighting Based on Temporal Coherence

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Functionality:**

The system aims to refine human presence detection by dynamically adjusting the weights assigned to individual keypoints based on their temporal consistency across multiple frames. The hypothesis is that stable, consistently detected keypoints are more reliable indicators of true human presence than fleeting or noisy detections.

**II. Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-frame-rate camera (minimum 30 FPS)
*   Dedicated processing unit (GPU or specialized AI accelerator) capable of real-time processing.
*   Sufficient memory to buffer multiple frames (at least 5-10 frames).

**III. Software Components:**

1.  **Keypoint Detection Module:** Utilizes existing keypoint detection algorithms (e.g., those mentioned in the source patent) to identify keypoints in each frame. Outputs a set of keypoint locations and confidence scores.
2.  **Temporal Coherence Tracker:**
    *   Maintains a history of keypoint detections for each identified individual (tracked across frames using bounding box or ID association techniques).
    *   Calculates a "Temporal Coherence Score" (TCS) for each keypoint.  TCS is computed as follows:
        *   Initialize TCS to 0.
        *   For each frame:
            *   If the keypoint is detected with a confidence score above a threshold (e.g., 0.5):
                *   Increment TCS by (1 - (1 - keypoint_confidence_score)^weight_factor).  *weight_factor* modulates the influence of confidence. Higher *weight_factor* means higher confidence is needed to significantly increase TCS.
            *   If the keypoint is *not* detected, decrement TCS by a decay rate (e.g., 0.05).  This prevents TCS from remaining high indefinitely for lost keypoints.
    *   Normalize the TCS across all keypoints to a range of 0-1.

3.  **Adaptive Weighting Module:**
    *   Receives the original keypoint confidence scores and the normalized TCS scores.
    *   Calculates a weighted keypoint confidence score for each keypoint as follows: `weighted_confidence = original_confidence * (1 + TCS * weight_multiplier)`. *weight_multiplier* controls the degree to which TCS influences the final confidence score.
    *   The weighted confidence scores replace the original confidence scores in the subsequent human presence detection process.

4.  **Human Presence Detection Module:**  Utilizes the standard human presence detection algorithms (as described in the source patent) but employs the *weighted* keypoint confidence scores.

**IV. Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
keypoint_history = {}  // Stores keypoint data across frames
weight_multiplier = 0.5
weight_factor = 2
decay_rate = 0.05

// Per Frame Processing
for each frame:
  keypoints = detect_keypoints(frame)

  for each keypoint in keypoints:
    keypoint_id = keypoint.id // Unique identifier for the keypoint

    if keypoint_id not in keypoint_history:
      keypoint_history[keypoint_id] = {
        'tcs': 0,
        'confidence_history': []
      }

    // Update Temporal Coherence Score
    if keypoint.confidence > 0.5:
      keypoint_history[keypoint_id]['tcs'] += (1 - (1 - keypoint.confidence)**weight_factor)
    else:
      keypoint_history[keypoint_id]['tcs'] -= decay_rate
      keypoint_history[keypoint_id]['tcs'] = max(0, keypoint_history[keypoint_id]['tcs'])

    // Normalize TCS (across all keypoints)
    tcs_values = [keypoint_history[k]['tcs'] for k in keypoint_history]
    max_tcs = max(tcs_values)
    normalized_tcs = keypoint_history[keypoint_id]['tcs'] / max_tcs if max_tcs > 0 else 0

    // Calculate Weighted Confidence
    weighted_confidence = keypoint.confidence * (1 + normalized_tcs * weight_multiplier)

    // Replace Original Confidence
    keypoint.confidence = weighted_confidence
```

**V. System Calibration:**

*   The *weight_multiplier*, *weight_factor*, and *decay_rate* parameters must be calibrated based on the specific application and environment.  This can be achieved using a labeled dataset of human presence/absence scenarios.
*   A moving average filter should be applied to the TCS to smooth out fluctuations and improve stability.

**VI. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Spatial Coherence:**  Incorporate spatial relationships between keypoints to further refine the weighting scheme.  For example, keypoints that consistently maintain a fixed distance from each other could be given higher weights.
*   **Activity Recognition:** Integrate activity recognition algorithms to provide contextual information that influences the weighting scheme.  For example, keypoints associated with active movements could be given higher weights during periods of detected activity.
