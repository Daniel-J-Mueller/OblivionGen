## Adaptive Echo Cancellation & Source Localization for Multi-Device Environments

**Concept:** Extend the selective audio ignoring concept to not just *ignore* re-triggered wake words, but to actively *localize* the original audio source and dynamically adjust echo cancellation/reduction across a network of devices. This tackles the problem of false positives in environments with multiple speakers and devices constantly outputting and re-capturing audio.

**Specs:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array (MMA):** Each device (speaker, assistant, etc.) requires a small MMA (4-8 mics minimum) capable of beamforming and sound source localization.
*   **Networked Audio Processing Unit (NAPU):** A dedicated, low-latency processing unit on each device, capable of running localization algorithms and dynamically adjusting audio filters. Can be integrated with existing SoC.
*   **Device Mesh Network:**  Reliable, low-latency communication protocol (e.g., utilizing Wi-Fi Direct or a dedicated short-range radio) allowing devices to share localization data.

**II. Software & Algorithm Components:**

1.  **Wake Word Detection (WWD) Enhancement:** Existing WWD should be enhanced to output not only *that* a wake word was detected but also a confidence score *and* a timestamp of initial detection.
2.  **Source Localization Algorithm:**  A real-time sound source localization algorithm operating on MMA data. This algorithm outputs:
    *   Azimuth/Elevation angles of the sound source.
    *   Distance estimate to the sound source.
    *   Confidence score of the localization.
3.  **Device Mesh Coordination Module:** This module manages communication and data sharing between devices.
4.  **Dynamic Echo Cancellation/Reduction Engine:** This engine adjusts echo cancellation/reduction filters based on localization data. It operates as follows:
    *   **Initial Wake Word Detection:** Device A detects a wake word. It broadcasts: (Wake Word, Timestamp, Localization Data (Azimuth, Elevation, Distance), Confidence).
    *   **Neighboring Device Response:** Neighboring devices (Device B, Device C) receive the broadcast.
    *   **Localization Cross-Validation:** Each neighbor uses its own MMA to confirm the source. If confirmed (above a threshold), the neighbor adjusts its echo cancellation/reduction filters.
        *   If the source is determined to be *outside* the device (e.g. a person speaking), increase sensitivity to the source.
        *   If the source is determined to be *within* the device (e.g., output from the device itself), aggressively suppress the signal.
    *   **Filter Adjustment:** The algorithm dynamically adjusts filter coefficients based on:
        *   Distance to the source.
        *   Direction of the source.
        *   Room acoustics (estimated via acoustic modeling).
        *   Signal strength.
5. **Confidence Thresholding:** All data points (WWD confidence, localization confidence) are filtered with adaptive thresholds based on environmental noise levels and device usage history.

**III. Pseudocode (Dynamic Filter Adjustment):**

```
// On Receiving Wake Word Broadcast from Device A:

function processWakeWordBroadcast(broadcastData) {
  //Get Wake word confidence from broadcast data
  let wakeWordConfidence = broadcastData.confidence
  // Perform localization using local MMA data
  let localLocalizationData = localizeSoundSource()

  //Cross validate with broadcasted data.
  if (validateLocalization(localLocalizationData, broadcastData.localizationData)) {
    //Determine source location
    let sourceLocation = calculateSourceLocation(localLocalizationData)
    // Adjust echo cancellation/reduction filters based on source location and signal strength
    adjustFilters(sourceLocation)

    //If source is internal output
    if(isInternalSource(sourceLocation)){
      aggressivelySuppressSignal()
    }else{
        enhanceSensitivityToSource()
    }
  }
}
```

**IV. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Multi-User Support:** Track individual user locations to prioritize voice commands.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrate with smart home sensors to refine acoustic models and improve accuracy.
*   **Directional Audio Output:** Steer audio output towards the user for a more immersive experience.
*   **Acoustic Mapping:** Create a dynamic acoustic map of the environment to improve localization and echo cancellation.
