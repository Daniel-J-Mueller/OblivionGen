## Dynamic Narrative Fingerprinting & Cross-Media Recommendation

**Concept:** Extend the literary fingerprinting to encompass *narrative structure* and then leverage this for recommendations *across different media*. The core idea is to identify not just *how* something is written (style, syntax), but *what* is happening in the story, and use this to suggest similar experiences, even if those experiences are in the form of films, games, or music.

**Specs:**

1.  **Narrative Event Extraction Module:**
    *   Input: Text of literary work.
    *   Process: Utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relationship Extraction, and Event Detection algorithms.  Identify key characters, locations, actions, and the relationships between them.
    *   Output:  A structured representation of the narrative's 'event graph'. Nodes represent entities/events; edges represent relationships (e.g., "Character A *loves* Character B," "Event X *causes* Event Y").

2.  **Narrative Fingerprint Generation:**
    *   Input: Event Graph, Syntactic/Semantic fingerprint (from the existing patent).
    *   Process:
        *   **Event Frequency Analysis:** Calculate the frequency of different *types* of events (e.g., conflict, resolution, discovery, betrayal).
        *   **Relationship Density:** Measure the overall interconnectedness of the event graph.  A dense graph indicates a complex plot with many interwoven relationships.
        *   **Emotional Arc Mapping:**  Analyze the emotional tone associated with each event and map the overall emotional trajectory of the story. Utilize sentiment analysis.
        *   **Fingerprint Vector Construction:** Combine the syntactic/semantic fingerprint with the narrative-derived metrics (event frequency, relationship density, emotional arc) into a single, high-dimensional fingerprint vector.

3.  **Cross-Media Database:**
    *   A database containing fingerprints for literary works, films, games, and music. The database should be designed to store and efficiently query these multi-dimensional fingerprint vectors.
    *   Each media entry will have a standardized 'metadata' tag, including the core events, characters, relationships and emotional arc.

4.  **Recommendation Engine:**
    *   Input: User's literary preferences (ratings, liked/disliked works), and desired media type (e.g., "recommend a film").
    *   Process:
        *   Generate a positive/negative user model based on the fingerprints of their liked/disliked literary works (as in the existing patent).
        *   Query the cross-media database for entries with fingerprints that are close to the user's positive model (and distant from the negative model).
        *   Rank the results based on fingerprint proximity.
        *   Present the recommendations to the user.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Engine):**

```
function recommend_media(user_id, media_type):
  user_positive_model = generate_user_model(user_id, "positive")
  user_negative_model = generate_user_model(user_id, "negative")

  results = query_cross_media_database(media_type)

  scored_results = []
  for media_entry in results:
    proximity_to_positive = calculate_fingerprint_proximity(media_entry.fingerprint, user_positive_model)
    distance_from_negative = calculate_fingerprint_proximity(media_entry.fingerprint, user_negative_model)
    score = proximity_to_positive - distance_from_negative
    scored_results.append((media_entry, score))

  sorted_results = sort_by_score(scored_results, descending=True)

  return sorted_results
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond stylistic similarity to analyze and recommend based on *narrative structure* and allows for recommendations across media boundaries.  It’s not just “books like this book,” but “experiences like this book,” regardless of the medium.
