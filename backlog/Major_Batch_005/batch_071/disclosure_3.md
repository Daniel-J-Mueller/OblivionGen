## Proactive Multi-Modal Sentiment-Triggered Contact

**Concept:** Extend the pre-authorized contact system to incorporate real-time sentiment analysis of customer digital interactions (text, voice) *before* they explicitly request contact. This enables proactive, personalized support triggered by negative sentiment, rather than solely relying on explicit requests.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Ingestion Module:**
    *   Real-time capture of customer text-based communications (chat, email, social media DMs, SMS) and voice interactions (call center recordings, VoIP conversations).
    *   Data anonymization/pseudonymization according to privacy regulations.
    *   Integration with existing CRM/communication platforms.

*   **Sentiment Analysis Engine:**
    *   Utilize a multi-modal AI model (combining Natural Language Processing & Voice Tone Analysis).
    *   Sentiment scoring: Assign a numerical value (e.g., -1 to +1) representing sentiment polarity (negative, neutral, positive).
    *   Emotion detection: Identify specific emotions (anger, frustration, sadness, joy, etc.).
    *   Contextual understanding:  Employ semantic analysis to account for sarcasm, idioms, and industry-specific language.

*   **Triggering Logic & Authorization Integration:**
    *   Define sentiment thresholds: Configure specific sentiment scores or emotion combinations that trigger a support request.  (e.g., Sentiment score < -0.7 *and* emotion = 'anger'.)
    *   Pre-authorization override:  Link sentiment-triggered requests to the existing pre-authorization system.
    *   Dynamic authorization adjustment:  Increase the authorized contact limit for customers exhibiting high levels of frustration, recognizing the urgency of their situation.
    *   Escalation pathway: For extremely negative sentiment scores, automatically escalate the request to a specialized support team.

*   **Contact Initiation & Interface:**
    *   Generate a personalized proactive contact notification: “We noticed you may be experiencing difficulty. A support agent is available to assist.” (Notification channel determined by customer preference).
    *   Pre-populate contact request with context: Automatically include relevant information such as recent interaction history, identified issues, and sentiment scores.
    *   Unique identifier preservation: Utilize the existing unique identifier system for seamless integration with the pre-authorization framework.

*   **Feedback & Learning Loop:**
    *   Post-contact survey: Gather customer feedback on the proactive support experience.
    *   Model retraining: Continuously refine the sentiment analysis model based on feedback and interaction data.
    *   Threshold optimization: Adjust sentiment thresholds based on performance metrics (e.g., customer satisfaction, resolution rate).

**Pseudocode (Triggering Logic):**

```
function analyze_interaction(interaction_data) {
  sentiment_score = sentiment_analysis_engine.score(interaction_data);
  emotions = sentiment_analysis_engine.detect_emotions(interaction_data);

  if (sentiment_score < -0.7 AND emotions.includes("anger")) {
    trigger_proactive_contact(customer_id);
  }
}

function trigger_proactive_contact(customer_id) {
  authorization_status = check_authorization(customer_id);

  if (authorization_status == "authorized") {
    generate_contact_notification(customer_id);
  } else {
    // Log authorization failure, potentially trigger escalation
  }
}
```
