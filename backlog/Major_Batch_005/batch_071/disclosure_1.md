## Modular Environmental Sensor Network with Adaptive Power Harvesting

**Concept:** A distributed network of micro-sensors capable of environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity, pressure, light, gas composition) with a unique adaptive power harvesting system and wireless data transmission.  Building on the idea of configurable connection points, this expands beyond simple function triggering to *dynamic* sensor configuration and power management.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Node Hardware:**
    *   Microcontroller: Low-power ARM Cortex-M4 (e.g., STM32L4 series).
    *   Sensor Suite: Integrated MEMS sensors (temperature, humidity, pressure), gas sensor (MQ series or similar), light sensor (photodiode/phototransistor).
    *   Communication:  LoRaWAN module (or similar long-range, low-power wireless protocol).
    *   Power Management:  Custom-designed power harvesting and storage circuitry (see below).
    *   Connector:  Array of configurable spring-loaded pins (similar to the patent, but with increased density and finer pitch - 0.5mm spacing) for both power input/output *and* data/control.  This allows nodes to share power or act as repeaters.
    *   Housing: Ruggedized, weatherproof enclosure (IP67 rated).  Dimensions: 25mm x 25mm x 10mm.

*   **Power Harvesting System:**
    *   Energy Sources:  Combination of:
        *   Photovoltaic film (flexible, high-efficiency).  Covers the majority of the sensor node surface.
        *   Piezoelectric transducer.  Captures vibrations from the environment (wind, movement).
        *   Thermoelectric generator (TEG).  Utilizes temperature differentials.
    *   Power Management IC (PMIC): Custom PMIC designed to:
        *   Maximize energy harvesting efficiency from all sources.
        *   Dynamically allocate power to sensors, communication, and storage.
        *   Implement a supercapacitor-based energy storage system. (200mF supercapacitor bank)
        *   Implement a 'sleep' mode to minimize power consumption.
    *   Bi-Directional Power Sharing: Configurable connection points enable nodes to share harvested energy with neighboring nodes.

*   **Network Topology & Communication:**
    *   Mesh Network: Nodes form a self-organizing mesh network.
    *   Adaptive Routing: Routing algorithms dynamically adjust based on node availability and signal strength.
    *   Data Aggregation: Nodes aggregate data locally to reduce transmission overhead.
    *   Gateway:  A central gateway node collects data from the mesh network and transmits it to a cloud platform.

*   **Software & Firmware:**
    *   Firmware:  C/C++ based firmware running on the microcontroller.
    *   Communication Protocol:  Custom LoRaWAN protocol optimized for sensor data transmission.
    *   Network Management:  Cloud-based platform for network monitoring, data visualization, and remote configuration.
    *   Data Analytics:  Data analytics algorithms to identify trends and anomalies in sensor data.

**Pseudocode (Energy Allocation):**

```
// Within the microcontroller firmware

function allocatePower() {
  // Read energy levels from all sources (PV, Piezo, TEG, Supercapacitor)
  pvEnergy = readPV();
  piezoEnergy = readPiezo();
  tegEnergy = readTEG();
  supercapEnergy = readSupercap();

  totalEnergy = pvEnergy + piezoEnergy + tegEnergy + supercapEnergy;

  // Determine priority of sensor operations (e.g., critical sensors get higher priority)
  sensorPriorities = [tempSensor, humiditySensor, gasSensor, lightSensor];

  // Calculate energy budget for each sensor based on priority and available energy
  for (sensor in sensorPriorities) {
    energyBudget = (totalEnergy * sensor.priority) / sumOfPriorities;
    sensor.activate(energyBudget); // Activate sensor with allocated energy
  }

  // If excess energy, charge supercapacitor
  if (totalEnergy > sumOfSensorEnergyUsage) {
    chargeSupercapacitor(totalEnergy - sumOfSensorEnergyUsage);
  }

  // If supercapacitor low, request energy from neighbor (via configurable pins)
  if (supercapEnergy < threshold) {
    requestEnergyFromNeighbor();
  }
}

//Called periodically
loop:
  allocatePower()
  readSensors()
  transmitData()
  sleep()
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simply accessing functions on a pre-existing board. It's a self-powered, adaptive network of environmental sensors, utilizing energy harvesting *and* enabling nodes to share power with each other. The configurable connection points aren't just for triggering functions; theyâ€™re integral to dynamic power management and network resilience. The pseudocode outlines how the system would proactively allocate and request power, ensuring continuous operation even in low-energy conditions.
