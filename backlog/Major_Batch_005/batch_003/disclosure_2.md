## Dynamic Repository Sharding with Predictive Consistency

**Concept:** Extend the offline/online repository concept to a *sharded* architecture, with predictive consistency checks happening *before* requests even reach a potentially offline shard. This anticipates shard failures and proactively routes requests to healthy replicas, minimizing latency spikes and availability concerns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shard Architecture:**

*   **Repository Decomposition:**  Divide the document repository into multiple shards based on content type, access frequency, or other relevant criteria.  Each shard operates as a semi-independent unit.
*   **Replica Sets:** Each shard is replicated across multiple physical servers (replica set) to provide redundancy and fault tolerance.
*   **Global Metadata Service:** A central service maintains metadata about all shards and their replicas: shard locations, health status, content ranges, and consistency guarantees.

**2. Request Routing & Predictive Consistency:**

*   **Client SDK:**  All client applications utilize a shared SDK. The SDK intercepts all repository requests.
*   **Request Fingerprinting:** The SDK calculates a "fingerprint" of the request based on the target document ID and anticipated modification type (read, write, delete).
*   **Predictive Consistency Check (PCC):** The SDK queries the Global Metadata Service *before* routing the request.  The Metadata Service maintains a small, rolling window of recent successful operations (version summary information) for each shard. 
    *   The Metadata Service compares the request fingerprint against this window.
    *   If a *similar* recent operation exists (high confidence of consistency), the request is routed to a healthy replica *without* checking the shard's online status.  This is the “optimistic bypass”.
    *   If no similar operation exists or confidence is low, a lightweight availability check (ping) is performed on the primary shard.
*   **Dynamic Routing:**
    *   If the primary shard is online and responsive, the request is routed there.
    *   If the primary shard is offline or unresponsive, the request is automatically routed to a healthy replica.
*   **Consistency Update:** Regardless of routing, successful operations on any replica are immediately propagated to the Global Metadata Service to update the rolling window of recent operations and version summary information.

**3.  Rolling Window Management:**

*   **Time-Based Decay:**  Entries in the rolling window are aged out after a defined period.
*   **Capacity Limits:**  The rolling window has a fixed capacity.  New entries overwrite older ones.
*   **Bloom Filters:** Utilize Bloom filters to efficiently check if a request fingerprint *might* exist in the rolling window before performing a full lookup. This reduces latency.

**Pseudocode (Client SDK - Request Handling):**

```
function handleRepositoryRequest(request):
  fingerprint = calculateRequestFingerprint(request)
  
  metadataResponse = queryGlobalMetadataService(fingerprint)

  if metadataResponse.consistentLikely:
    routeRequestToHealthyReplica(request, metadataResponse.replicaAddress)
    return

  if metadataResponse.shardOnline:
    routeRequestToPrimaryShard(request)
    return

  routeRequestToHealthyReplica(request, metadataResponse.replicaAddress)

  return
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Latency:** Optimistic bypass significantly reduces latency for frequently accessed documents.
*   **Increased Availability:** Automatic failover to replicas ensures high availability even during shard outages.
*   **Improved Scalability:** Sharding allows for horizontal scaling of the repository.
*   **Proactive Consistency:**  The rolling window and fingerprinting provide a degree of proactive consistency checking, reducing the risk of conflicts.
