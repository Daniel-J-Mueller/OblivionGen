## Adaptive Biometric Projection System

**Core Concept:** A user recognition device that *projects* a dynamic biometric signature onto the user, visible only under specific wavelengths (IR or UV) and adapts based on learned user behaviors. This moves beyond static identification to a continuously validated, actively changing biometric "aura."

**Specs:**

*   **Emitter Array:** Micro-LED array (density: 500 PPI minimum) embedded within device housing (wristband, glasses frame, clip-on). Configurable emission wavelengths (IR and UV primary).
*   **Biometric Data Acquisition:**
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) sensor (integrated).
    *   Skin Conductance sensor (integrated).
    *   Micro-Doppler radar (integrated) - detects subtle movements and breathing patterns.
    *   Microphone array (integrated) - analyzes vocal micro-expressions and speech patterns (optional, user selectable for privacy).
*   **Projection System:**
    *   Holographic diffuser layer over emitter array - creates a distributed, non-laser projection.
    *   Dynamic Pattern Generation: Real-time algorithm generates unique visual patterns (think flowing, fractal-like designs) based on aggregated biometric data. Patterns *aren't* a direct representation of biometric data but *respond* to it.
    *   Wavelength Modulation: Projection wavelength shifts based on confidence level. Higher confidence = more visible wavelength. Low confidence = subtle/invisible pattern.
*   **Learning Algorithm:**
    *   Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – learns the user's baseline biometric "signature" and adapts the projection pattern over time.
    *   Anomaly Detection: Identifies deviations from the learned signature, triggering adjustments to projection pattern (increased brightness, altered frequency, etc.) or authentication challenges.
*   **Privacy Features:**
    *   User-configurable projection visibility.
    *   Biometric data processed locally – no cloud storage.
    *   Projection can be disabled entirely.
*   **Power:** Wireless charging. Estimated battery life: 24 hours (active projection), 72 hours (standby).

**Pseudocode (Simplified Projection Algorithm):**

```
function generateProjectionPattern(HRV, SkinConductance, DopplerData, time) {
  // Normalize data to 0-1 range
  normalizedHRV = normalize(HRV, minHRV, maxHRV);
  normalizedSkinConductance = normalize(SkinConductance, minSkinConductance, maxSkinConductance);
  normalizedDoppler = normalize(DopplerData, minDoppler, maxDoppler);

  // Combine data into a "biometric vector"
  biometricVector = [normalizedHRV, normalizedSkinConductance, normalizedDoppler, time];

  // Feed biometric vector into RNN
  rnnOutput = RNN(biometricVector);

  // Map RNN output to visual parameters
  brightness = map(rnnOutput[0], 0, 1, 50, 255);
  frequency = map(rnnOutput[1], 0, 1, 1, 10);
  patternScale = map(rnnOutput[2], 0, 1, 1, 5);

  // Generate fractal pattern based on parameters
  fractalPattern = generateFractal(frequency, patternScale);

  // Apply brightness to pattern
  coloredPattern = applyBrightness(fractalPattern, brightness);

  return coloredPattern;
}
```

**Novelty:**

Traditional biometric systems *capture* a static identifier. This system *creates* a dynamic, ever-changing biometric "aura" that *reacts* to the user's physiological state. The holographic projection allows for subtle, non-intrusive authentication and potentially adds a layer of personalized aesthetic expression. It moves beyond simply *knowing* who the user is to *continuously verifying* that they are who they claim to be through a living, breathing biometric signature.
