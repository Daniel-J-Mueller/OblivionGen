**Adaptive Resource Allocation via Predictive System State**

**Concept:** Dynamically allocate system resources (CPU cycles, memory, network bandwidth) *before* a posture assessment is initiated, based on a predictive model of the systemâ€™s expected state *during* the assessment. This moves beyond simply granting elevated privileges; it anticipates resource needs and pre-allocates them, streamlining the assessment and potentially reducing its impact on user experience.

**Specs:**

1.  **Predictive Model Training:**
    *   Data Collection: Continuously monitor system resource usage during various operations (application launch, file access, network activity). Log CPU usage, memory allocation, disk I/O, network bandwidth. Include timestamps and operation metadata.
    *   Feature Extraction: Identify key features correlating to resource usage. These might include application type, file size, network protocol, user profile, and time of day.
    *   Model Selection: Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory network) to predict resource usage based on extracted features. The model should be continuously retrained using new data to improve accuracy.
    *   Model Storage: Store the trained model locally on the user device.

2.  **Pre-Assessment Resource Allocation:**
    *   Assessment Request Interception: Intercept the posture assessment request *before* any code is executed.
    *   Feature Extraction: Extract features from the assessment request (e.g., the type of assessment, the requested access level).
    *   Resource Prediction: Use the trained predictive model to estimate the CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network bandwidth required during the assessment.
    *   Resource Allocation: Dynamically allocate the predicted resources *before* executing any assessment code. This could involve increasing CPU priority, pre-allocating memory blocks, reserving disk I/O bandwidth, or prioritizing network traffic.

3.  **Dynamic Adjustment & Feedback:**
    *   Real-time Monitoring: Continuously monitor resource usage during the assessment.
    *   Adaptive Allocation: Adjust resource allocation dynamically based on real-time usage. If the predicted allocation is insufficient, increase it; if it is excessive, reduce it.
    *   Feedback Loop: Feed the real-time usage data back into the predictive model to improve its accuracy over time.

4.  **API Integration:**
    *   Provide an API for posture assessment systems to request pre-allocation of resources.
    *   The API should allow assessment systems to specify the type of assessment and the expected resource requirements.
    *   The API should return a status indicating whether the resource allocation was successful.

**Pseudocode (Resource Pre-Allocation API):**

```
function PreAllocateResources(assessmentType, expectedCPU, expectedMemory, expectedDiskIO, expectedNetwork) {
    // Extract features from assessmentType
    features = ExtractFeatures(assessmentType);

    // Predict resource needs using the trained model
    predictedCPU, predictedMemory, predictedDiskIO, predictedNetwork = PredictResourceNeeds(features);

    //Adjust predicted values based on assessment system input
    predictedCPU = max(predictedCPU, expectedCPU);
    predictedMemory = max(predictedMemory, expectedMemory);
    predictedDiskIO = max(predictedDiskIO, expectedDiskIO);
    predictedNetwork = max(predictedNetwork, expectedNetwork);

    // Allocate resources
    allocationStatus = AllocateResources(predictedCPU, predictedMemory, predictedDiskIO, predictedNetwork);

    // Return allocation status
    return allocationStatus;
}

function AllocateResources(cpu, memory, diskIO, network) {
    // Code to allocate CPU cycles, memory blocks, disk I/O bandwidth, and network priority
    // Return success or failure status
}

function PredictResourceNeeds(features) {
    // Load trained machine learning model
    // Input features into model
    // Output predicted CPU, memory, diskIO, network values
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond *granting* access. It proactively *prepares* the system, anticipating resource needs before the assessment even begins. It utilizes machine learning for adaptive allocation, maximizing efficiency and minimizing impact on the user experience. This differs from the provided patent which focuses on verifying posture *after* execution and doesn't address the issue of proactively preparing the system for assessment.
