## Autonomous Swarm Mapping & Reconstruction

**System Specs:**

*   **UAV Platform:** Miniature UAV (weight < 250g) with high-resolution camera (minimum 4K video, 12MP still), IMU, GPS, and dedicated short-range communication module (802.11ad/WiGig preferred). Battery life minimum 20 minutes.
*   **Ground Control System (GCS):** High-performance workstation with dedicated GPU, large storage capacity, and real-time processing capabilities.
*   **Communication:** Mesh network protocol for inter-UAV communication. Redundant communication links to GCS.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Swarm Coordination Module:** Distributes tasks, manages collision avoidance, and monitors UAV health.
    *   **Visual SLAM Module:** Performs Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using visual data from each UAV.
    *   **Point Cloud Fusion Module:** Merges point clouds from multiple UAVs into a single, coherent 3D model.
    *   **Reconstruction Module:** Converts point cloud data into textured 3D mesh.
    *   **AI-Assisted Feature Detection:** Detects and classifies objects within the reconstructed 3D model.

**Innovation Description:**

A system employing a swarm of miniature UAVs to rapidly map and reconstruct 3D environments, going beyond simple orthomosaic generation. The core innovation lies in leveraging the collective perception of the swarm to create highly detailed, textured 3D models in real-time.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Deployment:** User initiates mapping operation via GCS. Swarm of UAVs autonomously departs from a designated launch station.
2.  **Area Assignment:** Swarm Coordination Module divides the target area into smaller sub-regions, assigning each UAV a specific sub-region to map.
3.  **Autonomous Flight & Data Capture:** UAVs autonomously navigate their assigned sub-regions, capturing high-resolution images and video data.
4.  **Real-Time Data Processing:** 
    *   Visual SLAM modules on each UAV perform initial localization and mapping.
    *   Point Cloud Fusion module on the GCS merges point clouds from all UAVs, correcting for drift and inaccuracies.
5.  **3D Reconstruction & Texture Mapping:** 
    *   The fused point cloud is converted into a textured 3D mesh.
    *   AI-Assisted Feature Detection identifies and classifies objects within the reconstructed model (e.g., buildings, vehicles, people, vegetation).
6.  **Model Delivery:** The reconstructed 3D model is delivered to the user via GCS.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Coordination Module):**

```
// Initialize swarm parameters (number of UAVs, area size, etc.)
InitializeSwarm()

// Assign sub-regions to each UAV
AssignSubRegions()

// For each UAV:
For i = 0 to NumberOfUAVs - 1:
    // Start UAV flight
    StartUAVFlight(UAV[i])

    // While UAV is in flight:
    While UAV[i].IsFlying():
        // Receive data from UAV
        Data = ReceiveData(UAV[i])

        // Process data (localization, mapping, object detection)
        ProcessData(Data)

        // Check for collisions
        CheckForCollisions(UAV[i])

        // Send commands to UAV
        SendCommands(UAV[i])

    // UAV has completed its assigned task
    UAV[i].Land()

// All UAVs have completed their tasks
MergeData()
Generate3DModel()
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Rapid damage assessment after natural disasters.
*   Real-time mapping of construction sites.
*   Autonomous inspection of infrastructure (bridges, power lines, etc.).
*   Creation of virtual environments for training and simulation.
*   Search and rescue operations.
*   Automated volumetric surveys of stockpiles.
