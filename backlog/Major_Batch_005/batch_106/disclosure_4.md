## Dynamic Plugin Sandboxing with Reputation Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the private/public plugin setting to a dynamic sandboxing system coupled with a reputation scoring mechanism. This allows plugins to operate with varying levels of privilege based on the trustworthiness of the webpage requesting them *and* the plugin’s historical behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Reputation Engine:** A server-side component responsible for maintaining reputation scores for both webpages (domains) and plugins. Scores are updated based on user feedback (explicit reports, implicitly via behavior analysis – e.g., crash rates, resource consumption), security scans, and potentially community moderation.
*   **Sandbox Manager:** A client-side component that dynamically configures the execution environment for plugins. It supports multiple sandbox levels (e.g., full isolation, limited API access, network restrictions).
*   **Plugin Manifest Extension:** The existing application manifest is extended to include:
    *   `requestedPermissions`: A list of permissions the plugin *requests* but which are not granted by default.
    *   `reputationThreshold`: A minimum reputation score required to grant a requested permission.
    *   `sandboxLevelDefault`:  The default sandbox level the plugin operates within.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Webpage Request & Plugin Detection:** When a webpage requests a plugin, the browser identifies the plugin and associated application manifest.
2.  **Reputation Assessment:** The browser queries the Reputation Engine for:
    *   The webpage's domain reputation score.
    *   The plugin's overall reputation score.
3.  **Permission Evaluation:** For each `requestedPermission` in the plugin manifest:
    *   The browser checks if the webpage's domain reputation score meets the `reputationThreshold` for that permission.
    *   The browser checks if the plugin's overall reputation score is above a baseline threshold.
4.  **Sandbox Configuration:** The Sandbox Manager dynamically configures the plugin’s execution environment based on:
    *   The combined reputation scores.
    *   The granted permissions.
    *   The `sandboxLevelDefault` setting.
5.  **Plugin Execution:** The plugin executes within the configured sandbox.
6.  **Behavior Monitoring:** The browser monitors the plugin's behavior (resource consumption, network activity, API calls). Anomalous behavior negatively impacts the plugin’s reputation score.
7.  **User Feedback:** Users can explicitly report malicious or poorly-behaved plugins. This data is used to update reputation scores.

**3. Pseudocode (Client-Side - Browser Extension):**

```
function loadPlugin(pluginId, webpageDomain) {
  manifest = getPluginManifest(pluginId);
  webpageReputation = getReputation(webpageDomain);
  pluginReputation = getReputation(pluginId);

  sandboxLevel = manifest.sandboxLevelDefault;

  for (permission in manifest.requestedPermissions) {
    threshold = manifest.requestedPermissions[permission].reputationThreshold;
    if (webpageReputation >= threshold && pluginReputation > baseReputationThreshold) {
      grantPermission(permission);
    } else {
      // Permission denied - potentially log this.
    }
  }

  configureSandbox(pluginId, sandboxLevel);
  executePlugin(pluginId);
  monitorPluginBehavior(pluginId); // Background task.
}

function monitorPluginBehavior(pluginId) {
  // Track resource usage, API calls, network activity.
  // If anomalous behavior detected, reduce plugin reputation.
}
```

**4. Scalability & Security Considerations:**

*   **Distributed Reputation Engine:** Employ a distributed system (e.g., blockchain-based) to prevent single points of failure and ensure data integrity.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Reputation Engine and Sandbox Manager.
*   **Plugin Code Signing:** Require plugins to be digitally signed to verify their authenticity and prevent tampering.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent malicious actors from manipulating reputation scores.
