## Adaptive Authentication Thresholds Based on Behavioral Biometrics & Risk Scoring

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Behavioral Biometric Sensor Suite:** Integrated software module capturing real-time user behavior data. This includes:
    *   **Keystroke Dynamics:** Timing, pressure, and patterns of key presses.
    *   **Mouse/Touchpad Movement:** Speed, acceleration, pressure, and patterns.
    *   **Scroll Behavior:** Speed, patterns, and areas of focus.
    *   **Device Orientation & Motion:** (Mobile/Laptop) – accelerometer and gyroscope data.
    *   **Application Usage Patterns:** Frequency, duration, and sequence of application usage.
*   **Risk Scoring Engine:** A machine learning model trained on historical data (successful/failed logins, fraudulent activity, device characteristics, location data, time of day, etc.). This engine assigns a dynamic risk score to each login attempt/session.
*   **Authentication Threshold Manager:**  This module adjusts the authentication requirements *in real-time* based on the Risk Score and a user’s established behavioral profile.
*   **Adaptive Challenge System:** Presents challenges to the user if the Risk Score exceeds a pre-defined threshold or deviates significantly from their behavioral profile. This could include:
    *   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) – Push notifications, SMS codes, etc.
    *   Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) – Security questions.
    *   Biometric Verification (Fingerprint, Face ID).
    *   Contextual Challenges (e.g. re-verify location).

**II.  Workflow & Pseudocode:**

```
// 1. User Initiates Login/Session
UserInitiatesLogin();

// 2. Gather Initial Contextual Data (Location, Device, Time)
ContextData = GatherContextualData();

// 3. Collect Behavioral Biometric Data
BiometricData = CollectBiometricData();

// 4. Calculate Risk Score
RiskScore = CalculateRiskScore(ContextData, BiometricData, UserHistory);

// 5. Determine Authentication Level
AuthenticationLevel = DetermineAuthenticationLevel(RiskScore, UserProfile);

// 6. Present Challenges (if necessary)
IF AuthenticationLevel == "High" THEN
    PresentChallenge(ChallengeType = MFA); // Or KBA, Biometric Verification, etc.
    VerifyResponse(UserResponse);
    IF VerificationSuccessful THEN
        GrantAccess();
    ELSE
        DenyAccess();
    ENDIF
ELSE
    GrantAccess(); // No challenge needed
ENDIF

// 7. Continuous Monitoring
WHILE SessionActive DO
    ContinuouslyCollectBiometricData();
    ContinuouslyMonitorRiskScore();
    IF RiskScoreChangesSignificantly THEN
        AdjustAuthenticationLevel();
        PresentAdaptiveChallenge(); // Potentially increase security mid-session
    ENDIF
ENDWHILE
```

**III. Data Storage & Management:**

*   **Behavioral Profiles:** Store anonymized and encrypted user behavioral data (keystroke dynamics, mouse movement patterns, etc.).  Employ differential privacy techniques to protect user data.
*   **Risk Model Training Data:** Store historical login data, fraud reports, and user behavior patterns for training the Risk Scoring Engine.
*   **Session Data:**  Record session activity and risk scores for auditing and anomaly detection.

**IV.  Key Innovations:**

*   **Dynamic Thresholds:**  Adapt authentication requirements based on *real-time* risk assessment and user behavior.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:**  Monitor user behavior *throughout* the session to detect anomalies and adjust security levels as needed.
*   **Proactive Security:**  Address potential threats *before* they materialize by proactively adjusting authentication requirements.
*   **Adaptive Challenges:** Provide a seamless user experience by only presenting challenges when *necessary*.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Technologies:**  Employ differential privacy and anonymization techniques to protect user data.
