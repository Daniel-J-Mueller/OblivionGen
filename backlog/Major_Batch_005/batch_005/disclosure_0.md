## Adaptive Synthetic Data Generation via Generative Questioning

**Concept:** Expand on the synthetic data generation aspect of the patent by introducing a system that *actively* questions the training code to refine the synthetic error injection process. The core idea is to move beyond simple pattern-based deletion or mutation, and instead leverage a generative model to *understand* the code’s intent and generate more realistic/challenging error scenarios.

**Specifications:**

**1. Knowledge Graph Construction:**

*   **Input:** Correct portion of training code (as per the patent).
*   **Process:** Utilize a static analysis tool (e.g., CodeQL, Semgrep) combined with a large language model (LLM) to construct a knowledge graph representing the code's structure, data flow, and intended functionality. Nodes represent functions, variables, control structures, and data types. Edges represent relationships between these elements (e.g., function calls, data dependencies).
*   **Output:** A knowledge graph in a standardized format (e.g., GraphML).

**2. Generative Questioning Module:**

*   **Input:** Knowledge graph, identified error type (e.g., resource leak).
*   **Process:** Employ an LLM fine-tuned for code understanding and question generation. The LLM generates a series of targeted questions designed to probe the code’s behavior related to the identified error type. Examples:
    *   "What resources are allocated within this function?"
    *   "Under what conditions is this resource deallocated?"
    *   "Are there any potential race conditions that could lead to a resource leak?"
    *   "What inputs could trigger an unhandled exception in this code?"
*   **Output:** A list of questions, along with expected answers derived from the knowledge graph.

**3. Synthetic Error Injection & Validation:**

*   **Input:**  Correct training code, questions & expected answers, identified error type.
*   **Process:**
    *   The system *attempts* to answer the generated questions using the correct training code.
    *   If the system *fails* to answer a question accurately, this indicates a potential vulnerability or edge case.
    *   The system automatically *mutates* the training code to create an error scenario that causes the question to fail, effectively injecting a synthetic error.  The mutation is guided by the information gleaned from the failed question.
    *   A validation step confirms that the injected error causes the expected behavior (e.g., resource leak, crash).
*   **Output:** Synthetically generated labeled data (code with injected errors and corresponding labels).

**4. Adaptive Feedback Loop:**

*   **Process:** Monitor the performance of the error detection model trained on the synthetic data. If the model struggles with certain types of errors, the Generative Questioning Module automatically adjusts its strategy:
    *   Generate more challenging questions.
    *   Focus on specific areas of the code.
    *   Explore different mutation techniques.
*   **Output:** Refined synthetic data generation process.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```python
def generate_synthetic_data(training_code, error_type):
    knowledge_graph = build_knowledge_graph(training_code)
    questions = generate_questions(knowledge_graph, error_type)

    synthetic_data = []
    for question in questions:
        answer = attempt_answer(training_code, question)
        if answer == None:  # Question failed
            mutated_code = mutate_code(training_code, question)
            label = "error_" + error_type
            synthetic_data.append((mutated_code, label))
    return synthetic_data
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond simple pattern-based synthetic data generation by employing a generative questioning approach. This allows for the creation of more realistic and challenging error scenarios, leading to more robust error detection models. The adaptive feedback loop ensures that the synthetic data generation process is continuously refined based on the performance of the model. This system will create a new branch of code by refining the training data by a series of questionings.
