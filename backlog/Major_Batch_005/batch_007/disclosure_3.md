## Dynamic Ad Slate Composition based on User Emotional State

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend dynamic ad insertion (DAI) to incorporate real-time user emotional analysis and dynamically compose ad slates (sequences of advertisements) optimized for emotional impact *and* revenue.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Emotional Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Live video stream (or near-real-time capture).
    *   Processing: Employs computer vision (facial expression recognition) and audio analysis (speech emotion recognition) to determine the user's current emotional state (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, neutral).  Data fusion algorithms combine visual and auditory data for increased accuracy.  Outputs an emotional state vector.
    *   Hardware: Requires sufficient processing power (GPU acceleration recommended) for real-time analysis.
*   **Ad Slate Composition Engine:**
    *   Input: Emotional state vector from the Emotional Analysis Module, current live stream content metadata (genre, themes, etc.), pre-defined ad creative metadata (emotional valence, arousal levels, target demographics, revenue potential), and real-time bidding (RTB) data.
    *   Processing:  Utilizes a reinforcement learning (RL) agent trained to maximize both revenue and a 'user engagement' metric derived from predicted emotional response to ad slates.  The RL agent considers:
        *   **Emotional Congruence:** Selects ads that align with or strategically contrast the user's emotional state. (e.g., uplifting ads for sad users, calming ads for angry users).
        *   **Emotional Arc:** Structures ad slates with a deliberate emotional progression.
        *   **Ad Sequencing:** Considers the order of ads within a slate to avoid emotional fatigue or jarring transitions.
        *   **Revenue Optimization:** Balances emotional impact with bid price from RTB exchanges.
    *   Output:  Dynamically generated ad slate (sequence of ad IDs and durations).
*   **DAI Integration Module:** Standard DAI integration with existing streaming platforms.

**III. Pseudocode (Ad Slate Composition Engine):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION ComposeAdSlate(emotionalState, streamMetadata, adMetadata, rtbData)

    // Initialize slate with default parameters (duration, slot count)
    slate = InitializeSlate()

    FOR EACH adSlot IN slate.slots

        // Filter available ads based on stream metadata and emotional state
        filteredAds = FilterAds(adMetadata, streamMetadata, emotionalState)

        // Calculate a "reward score" for each filtered ad
        FOR EACH ad IN filteredAds
            rewardScore = CalculateRewardScore(ad, emotionalState, rtbData)
            ad.rewardScore = rewardScore
        END FOR

        // Select ad with highest reward score
        bestAd = SelectBestAd(filteredAds)

        // Add ad to slate
        slate.AddAd(bestAd)

    END FOR

    RETURN slate
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateRewardScore(ad, emotionalState, rtbData)
    // Combine emotional congruence, revenue potential, and ad metadata
    emotionalCongruenceScore = CalculateEmotionalCongruence(ad, emotionalState)
    revenueScore = rtbData.bidPrice * ad.revenueFactor
    rewardScore = (emotionalCongruenceScore * weightEmotional) + (revenueScore * weightRevenue)
    RETURN rewardScore
END FUNCTION
```

**IV.  Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance server with GPU acceleration.
*   Real-time video/audio capture device.
*   High-bandwidth network connection.

**V. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Personalized Ad Creation:**  Dynamically generate ad creatives based on the user's emotional state and preferences.
*   **Biofeedback Integration:** Integrate data from wearable sensors (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance) to improve emotional analysis accuracy.
*   **A/B Testing:** Continuously A/B test different ad slate composition strategies to optimize performance.
*   **Multi-User Emotional Analysis:** Analyze the emotional state of multiple viewers to create a collective emotional profile for targeted advertising.
