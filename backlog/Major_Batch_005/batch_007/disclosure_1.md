## Integrated Thermoelectric Cooling & Energy Harvesting

**Specification:** Aerial Vehicle Propulsion System – Integrated Thermoelectric Modules

**Concept:** Augment the passive airflow cooling described in the source patent with actively controlled thermoelectric cooling (TEC) and energy harvesting. Utilize the temperature differential created by the motor’s operation and the airflow to generate electricity *and* actively cool critical motor components.

**System Components:**

*   **Thermoelectric Modules (TEMs):** Solid-state devices integrated into the motor casing, positioned between the stator/windings and the outer casing. These modules act as both heat pumps (cooling) and generators (electricity).
*   **Heat Sinks/Spreaders:** High thermal conductivity materials (e.g., copper, carbon fiber composite) integrated with the TEMs to efficiently transfer heat from the motor’s internals to the exterior airflow. These also serve to spread heat for more uniform TEM operation.
*   **Micro-DC-DC Converters:** Small, efficient DC-DC converters to boost the low voltage generated by the TEMs to a usable level for powering sensors, control circuits, or auxiliary systems.
*   **Control System:** A microcontroller-based system that monitors motor temperature, airflow rate, and TEM performance. The system dynamically adjusts the current supplied to the TEMs, switching between cooling mode and generation mode based on operational requirements.
*   **Airflow Guides:** Strategically positioned baffles/vanes within the motor housing and fairing to direct airflow over the heat sinks and maximize heat transfer efficiency.

**Operational Modes:**

1.  **High-Load/Cooling Mode:** During periods of high motor load (e.g., takeoff, maneuvering), the control system activates the TEMs in cooling mode. The TEMs pump heat from the motor’s internal components to the exterior airflow, preventing overheating and improving performance.
2.  **Cruise/Generation Mode:** During periods of low motor load (e.g., cruise), the control system switches the TEMs to generation mode. The temperature differential between the motor and the airflow is used to generate electricity, which is stored in a small onboard battery or used to power auxiliary systems.
3.  **Hybrid Mode:** Dynamically adjusts between cooling and generation modes based on real-time conditions, optimizing energy efficiency and performance.

**Pseudocode (Control System):**

```
// Define temperature thresholds
const int overheatThreshold = 90; // Degrees Celsius
const int optimalTemp = 60;

// Function to read temperature sensor
int readMotorTemp() {
  // Sensor read code
  return motorTemperature;
}

// Function to control TEMs (cooling/generation)
void controlTEMs(bool coolingMode) {
  if (coolingMode) {
    // Activate cooling mode (apply current to TEMs)
  } else {
    // Activate generation mode (allow TEMs to generate electricity)
  }
}

// Main loop
void loop() {
  motorTemp = readMotorTemp();

  if (motorTemp > overheatThreshold) {
    controlTEMs(true); // Enable cooling
  } else if (motorTemp < optimalTemp) {
    controlTEMs(false); // Enable generation
  } else {
    //Maintain current state
  }
}
```
