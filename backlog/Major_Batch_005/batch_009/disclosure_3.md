## Personalized Content "Time Capsules"

**Concept:** Extend the system's ability to not just identify and deliver content *based* on topics, but to curate and deliver content *predictively*, based on a user's evolving interests *over time*, packaged as personalized “Time Capsules.”

**Specs:**

*   **Data Storage:** Expand the user profile database. Add a “Temporal Interest Vector” (TIV) for each user. The TIV is a multi-dimensional array storing weighted topic preferences *and* timestamps associated with those preferences. Weights decay exponentially over time – recent interests have higher weights.
*   **Content Acquisition Module:** A new module dedicated to proactively sourcing content. It’s not just reacting to user requests. This module continuously scans various data sources (news feeds, social media, streaming services, podcasts, articles) based on the TIV for each user.
*   **"Time Capsule" Assembly:**  A scheduled process (e.g., daily, weekly) that assembles a "Time Capsule" for each user. The capsule contains:
    *   **"Now" Content:** Content directly matching current high-weight topics in the TIV.
    *   **"Echoes" Content:** Content related to topics that *were* significant in the past (medium-weight, decaying), presented as "Remember when you were interested in…"
    *   **"Seed" Content:** Content related to *emerging* interests (low weight, increasing), presented as "You might also enjoy…" – predictive recommendations.
*   **Delivery Mechanism:**
    *   **Multi-Modal:**  The Time Capsule can be delivered via audio (summarized readings, podcast clips), text (article snippets, news headlines), or visual media (short video clips, images).  User preference dictates delivery mode.
    *   **Contextual Delivery:** Time Capsules are delivered during defined “quiet moments” detected by the device (e.g., during commute, when stationary, during scheduled “break” times).
*   **User Feedback Loop:**
    *   **Explicit Ratings:** Users can rate the relevance of each item within a Time Capsule (thumbs up/down).
    *   **Implicit Signals:** System monitors user engagement (e.g., how long they listen, if they share content) to refine the TIV.

**Pseudocode (Time Capsule Assembly):**

```
function assembleTimeCapsule(userProfile) {
  TIV = userProfile.temporalInterestVector
  nowContent = getContent(TIV.highWeightTopics)
  echoContent = getContent(TIV.mediumWeightTopics)
  seedContent = getContent(TIV.emergingTopics)

  timeCapsule = {
    now: nowContent,
    echo: echoContent,
    seed: seedContent
  }

  return timeCapsule
}

function getContent(topics) {
  contentList = []
  for topic in topics {
    results = searchContentSources(topic)
    contentList.append(selectTopResults(results)) // Limit the number of results
  }
  return contentList
}
```

**Refinement Considerations:**

*   **Emotional Tone Analysis:** Incorporate sentiment analysis of content to ensure the Time Capsule's emotional tone aligns with user preference.
*   **Serendipity Factor:** Intentionally introduce a small amount of random, unrelated content to encourage discovery.
*   **Collaborative Filtering:** Leverage data from users with similar interests to enhance content recommendations.
*   **Privacy Controls:** Allow users to control the level of data used to personalize their Time Capsules.
