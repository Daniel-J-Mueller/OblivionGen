## Dynamic Proximity-Based Influence Mapping

**Concept:** Leverage predicted location data not just for *where* a user will be, but to model their potential *influence* on others at that location. This goes beyond simple proximity alerts and creates a dynamic map of influence, useful for targeted advertising, event promotion, and even social network analysis.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Input:**

*   **User Location History:** As per the existing patent - past location data, recent location, predicted future locations.
*   **Social Network Graph:**  Data linking users – friendships, followers, professional connections. This could be integrated from existing social platforms via API access (with user consent).
*   **POI (Point of Interest) Data:** Database of locations with associated attributes (business type, event schedules, demographics of frequent visitors).
*   **Influence Metrics:**  A system for quantifying a user’s influence. This could be based on:
    *   Social media engagement (likes, shares, comments).
    *   Purchase history (indicates brand loyalty & spending power).
    *   Network centrality (number of connections, reach within the social graph).
    *   User-defined "interest categories" (allows targeting based on expressed preferences).

**2. Processing – Influence Map Generation:**

*   **Prediction Horizon:**  The system must predict locations over variable time horizons (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week).
*   **Influence Radius:**  Each user is assigned an ‘influence radius’ based on their influence metrics. Higher influence = larger radius.
*   **POI Weighting:** POIs are assigned weights based on their relevance to user interests.
*   **Dynamic Map Creation:**  
    1.  For each predicted user location & time:
    2.  Identify all POIs within the user's influence radius.
    3.  Calculate an ‘influence score’ for each POI, factoring in:
        *   User’s influence metrics.
        *   POI weighting.
        *   Time of day (some POIs are more relevant at certain times).
        *   Density of other influential users at that POI.
    4.  Generate a heatmap or overlay on a map visualising the influence scores.

**3. Output & Application:**

*   **Real-time Influence Map:** A dynamically updated map showing current and predicted influence concentrations.
*   **Targeted Advertising:** Display ads to users *within* the influence radius of key influencers.
*   **Event Promotion:** Identify influencers likely to attend an event & promote it to their network.
*   **Social Network Analysis:** Visualise the spread of information or trends within a network.
*   **API Access:** Allow third-party developers to integrate the influence map data into their own applications.

**Pseudocode (Influence Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateInfluenceScore(user, poi, time):
  userInfluence = getUserInfluence(user)
  poiWeight = getPoiWeight(poi, user.interestCategories)
  timeFactor = getTimeFactor(poi, time) // Adjusts score based on time of day
  proximityFactor = calculateProximityFactor(user.predictedLocation, poi.location)

  influenceScore = userInfluence * poiWeight * timeFactor * proximityFactor

  return influenceScore
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Scalable cloud infrastructure for data storage & processing.
*   Real-time location tracking capabilities.
*   API integrations with social media platforms.
*   Geospatial database for efficient POI lookups.
*   Map visualisation library.
