## Autonomous Predictive Fragment Prioritization & Delivery – "Chameleon Stream"

**Concept:** Expand upon the fragment-based delivery system described in the patent to create a dynamically prioritized and delivered video/sensor stream tailored to individual consumer devices and network conditions – a “Chameleon Stream”.  Instead of simply buffering and re-sending fragments based on network status, *predict* network capacity and device capabilities *before* transmission and adjust fragment quality, content prioritization, and delivery schedules accordingly.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Analytics Module:**

*   **Inputs:** Real-time network metrics (bandwidth, latency, packet loss) from the sending device, historical network performance data, consumer device specifications (processing power, screen resolution, supported codecs), user profile data (viewing history, preferences).
*   **Algorithm:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained to predict future network capacity and device performance based on the input data.  The LSTM will output a “Quality of Service (QoS) Profile” – a dynamic set of parameters defining acceptable fragment quality, prioritization, and delivery rate.
*   **Outputs:**  QoS Profile, updated every 100ms.  Includes:
    *   Target Bitrate (kbps)
    *   Maximum Fragment Size (bytes)
    *   Prioritization Weight (0.0 - 1.0) -  Used to influence fragment scheduling (see Fragment Scheduler).
    *   Content Focus (e.g., "Motion Detection," "Facial Recognition," "Object Tracking") – indicates which content within the stream should be prioritized for higher quality delivery.

**2. Fragment Generator & Prioritization Engine:**

*   **Input:** Raw video/sensor data stream, QoS Profile.
*   **Process:**
    *   Divides the raw stream into fragments (variable length – up to 500ms duration).
    *   Generates multiple versions of each fragment – “High Quality” (original), “Medium Quality” (reduced resolution/bitrate), “Low Quality” (highly compressed, keyframe only).
    *   Assigns a “Priority Score” to each fragment based on:
        *   QoS Profile’s Prioritization Weight.
        *   Content Focus (fragments containing prioritized content receive higher scores).
        *   Temporal Importance (fragments representing critical events – e.g., rapid motion, detected anomalies – receive higher scores).
*   **Output:** A queue of fragments, each with associated quality level and priority score.

**3. Fragment Scheduler & Delivery System:**

*   **Input:** Fragment queue, network metrics, consumer device status.
*   **Algorithm:** A priority-based scheduling algorithm that dynamically selects fragments for transmission based on:
    *   Fragment priority score.
    *   Available network bandwidth.
    *   Consumer device processing capacity.
    *   Historical delivery success rates.
*   **Process:**
    *   Selects the highest priority fragment that can be reliably delivered given current network conditions and device capabilities.
    *   Transmits the selected fragment using the appropriate quality level.
    *   Monitors delivery success rates and adjusts scheduling parameters accordingly.
*   **Output:** Transmitted fragments.

**4. Acknowledgment System Enhancement:**

*   **Add:**  A “Quality Received” acknowledgment.  In addition to the existing acknowledgments (start, complete, persisted), the endpoint sends a signal indicating the *quality* of the received fragment (e.g., “High,” “Medium,” “Low,” “Corrupted”).  This data feeds back into the Predictive Analytics Module to refine QoS predictions.

**Pseudocode (Fragment Scheduler):**

```
while (streamActive) {
    // Get the highest priority fragment
    fragment = GetHighestPriorityFragment(fragmentQueue)

    // Check if the fragment can be reliably delivered
    if (CanDeliverReliably(fragment, networkMetrics, deviceStatus)) {
        Transmit(fragment)
    } else {
        // If not, select a lower quality version or skip
        if (lowerQualityVersionExists(fragment)) {
           fragment = getLowerQualityVersion(fragment)
           Transmit(fragment)
        } else {
           //Skip, and try again at next cycle
           log("Skipped fragment due to network conditions")
        }
    }
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple buffering and retransmission. It *predicts* network and device limitations and proactively adjusts fragment characteristics *before* transmission, maximizing perceived quality and minimizing interruptions. The "Quality Received" feedback loop and proactive QoS prediction are key differentiators.
