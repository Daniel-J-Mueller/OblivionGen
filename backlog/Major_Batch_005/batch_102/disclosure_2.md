## Adaptive Projection Mapping for Textile Design

**Concept:** Expand the projection system beyond simple dimensional representation of *finished* goods to a dynamic textile design tool. Utilize the projection system to visualize and modify textile patterns *directly onto* a fabric substrate before manufacturing.

**System Specs:**

*   **Projection Unit:** High-resolution, multi-spectral projector (RGB + IR/UV) capable of projecting onto a variety of fabric types and colors.  Integrated distance/angle sensors.
*   **Fabric Substrate:**  Any woven, knit, or non-woven textile material. Ideally, a base fabric with neutral reflectance characteristics.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution camera system (visible light + IR/UV) to capture fabric texture, weave structure, and projected patterns.
    *   Depth sensor (LiDAR or structured light) to map the 3D surface of the fabric, accounting for drape, folds, and imperfections.
    *   Colorimeter to accurately measure fabric color and reflectance.
*   **Control System:**  Dedicated processing unit (GPU-accelerated) running custom software for pattern generation, projection control, sensor data processing, and user interface.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Pattern Library:**  Extensive library of pre-designed textile patterns, including geometric, floral, abstract, and custom designs.
    *   **Pattern Editor:**  Intuitive graphical interface for creating and modifying textile patterns. Features include:
        *   Vector-based drawing tools.
        *   Color palette management.
        *   Repeat pattern creation.
        *   Simulation of different weave structures.
        *   Import/Export of standard textile design files (e.g., EPS, AI, SVG).
    *   **Projection Mapping Engine:**  Algorithm that warps and blends the projected image to accurately conform to the 3D surface of the fabric. Uses data from the depth sensor to compensate for fabric drape and folds.
    *   **Real-time Rendering Engine:**  High-performance rendering engine that supports real-time visualization of the projected pattern on the fabric.
    *   **Interactive Design Mode:** Allows a designer to manipulate the projected pattern directly on the fabric using hand gestures or other input devices.
    *   **Fabric Simulation Module:** Predicts how the projected pattern will look after the fabric is dyed, washed, or otherwise treated.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Automated procedure to calibrate the projection system, sensor suite, and control system. This ensures accurate projection mapping and real-time rendering.

**Operation:**

1.  The fabric substrate is placed on a flat surface or draped on a mannequin.
2.  The sensor suite captures the 3D surface of the fabric.
3.  The user selects a pattern from the pattern library or creates a custom pattern using the pattern editor.
4.  The control system warps and blends the pattern to accurately conform to the 3D surface of the fabric.
5.  The projector projects the pattern onto the fabric.
6.  The user can interact with the pattern in real-time, modifying its size, color, and position.
7.  The fabric simulation module predicts how the pattern will look after it is processed.
8.  The user can save the design to a file for manufacturing.

**Pseudocode - Projection Mapping Engine:**

```
function project_pattern(pattern_data, fabric_mesh, projection_matrix):
  // fabric_mesh: 3D representation of the fabric surface
  // projection_matrix: Transformation matrix to align the pattern with the fabric

  warped_pattern = apply_texture_mapping(pattern_data, fabric_mesh, projection_matrix)

  // Correct for fabric drape/folds:
  for each vertex in fabric_mesh:
    adjust_texture_coordinates(vertex, warped_pattern)

  render_warped_pattern(warped_pattern)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Rapid prototyping of textile designs.
*   Customization of apparel and home goods.
*   On-demand textile manufacturing.
*   Interactive design of fabric patterns.
*   Virtual try-on of clothing.
*   Digital textile art.
