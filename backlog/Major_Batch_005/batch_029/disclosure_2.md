## Proximity-Based Automated Task Handoff

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Components:** Voice-controlled device (similar to existing patent), user mobile device (smartphone/smartwatch), network connectivity (WiFi/Cellular), dedicated server infrastructure.
*   **Data Requirements:** User profiles (preferences, roles, permissions), location data (GPS, Bluetooth beacons, WiFi triangulation), task lists (integrated with existing productivity apps or custom API), organizational chart (for relationship identification - same as existing patent).
*   **Hardware Additions:** Low-energy Bluetooth beacons strategically placed within a defined workspace (office, home, factory).

**Functionality:**

1.  **Proximity Detection:** Bluetooth beacons constantly broadcast signals. User’s mobile device (with app installed) detects beacon signals. Device triangulates position based on signal strength from multiple beacons.  Position data sent to server.
2.  **Task Assessment:** Server receives proximity data. It accesses user's task list (integrated with apps like Todoist, Asana, or a custom database). It identifies tasks relevant to the current location.  Relevance determined by keywords in task description or location tags.
3.  **Automated Handoff:** If a task requires physical presence at the detected location, the system assesses if another user is present *and* authorized to complete the task. Authorization determined by role, skillset, and availability (as established by the existing patent’s availability information).
4.  **Voice-Triggered Transfer:** If an authorized user is nearby, the system initiates a voice prompt via the voice-controlled device: “User X is in proximity and authorized to handle task Y.  Would you like to transfer the task?”
5.  **Task Transfer & Logging:** Upon voice confirmation, the task is automatically assigned to the nearby user in the task management system. All transfer activity is logged (user initiating transfer, user receiving transfer, timestamp, location).
6.  **Adaptive Learning:** The system learns user preferences over time. If a user consistently transfers certain tasks to specific individuals at certain locations, the system will prioritize those individuals as potential recipients in the future.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Server-side logic

function processProximityData(userID, locationData) {
  tasks = getTasksForUser(userID);
  relevantTasks = filterTasksByLocation(tasks, locationData);

  for each task in relevantTasks {
    nearbyUsers = findNearbyAuthorizedUsers(locationData, task.requiredSkills);
    if (nearbyUsers.length > 0) {
      // Initiate voice prompt to user initiating task
      sendVoicePrompt(userID, "Nearby user " + nearbyUsers[0].name + " is authorized to handle task: " + task.title);
      //Awaiting confirmation for transfer
    }
  }
}

function findNearbyAuthorizedUsers(location, requiredSkills) {
  // Access database of user profiles, skills, and current locations
  // Filter users based on proximity to location and matching skills
  return authorizedUsers;
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with building management systems to control access and lighting based on user proximity.
*   Dynamic task prioritization based on real-time location and urgency.
*   “Ghost Mode” – temporarily disable task handoff functionality for focused work.
*   Multi-user awareness – display nearby colleagues and their current task status.
