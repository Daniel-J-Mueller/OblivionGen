## Dynamic Contextual Search Expansion

**Concept:** Expanding search beyond immediate results to proactively offer related contextual information *within* the content page, leveraging a multi-layered, visually-driven approach. This moves beyond simple suggested terms/images to building a dynamic knowledge “bubble” around the user’s initial query.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Data Structure – Context Nodes:**

*   Each search result (and suggested search term) is represented as a “Context Node”.
*   Each Node contains:
    *   Result/Term Data (title, image, link)
    *   Semantic Tags (derived from NLP analysis of the result/term – e.g., "laptop", "gaming", "Intel Core i7")
    *   Related Node IDs (pointers to other Context Nodes with strong semantic connections)
    *   Node Weight (a measure of relevance to the original query and overall user engagement)

**2. Visualization Layer – “Knowledge Bloom”:**

*   Initial search result(s) are displayed conventionally.
*   Around the initial results, a visually expanding “bloom” of related Context Nodes is rendered. This isn’t a flat list, but a radial/organic layout.
*   Nodes closer to the initial result are higher weight/more relevant. Distance from the center visually represents relevance.
*   Nodes are represented by small, visually distinct “cards” containing a representative image and short title.
*   Cards are subtly animated (pulse, shimmer) to draw attention.

**3. Interaction & Navigation:**

*   **Hover:** Hovering over a Context Node card highlights it and displays a brief descriptive tooltip.
*   **Click:** Clicking a Node card:
    *   Updates the central content area with results for that Node’s term/entity.
    *   Redraws the Knowledge Bloom, centered on the new query.
    *   Dynamically recalculates Node weights and connections based on the new context.
*   **“Explore” Button:** Each Node card has a small "Explore" button. This triggers a deeper dive – opening a sidebar or pop-up with detailed information about the entity (sourced from knowledge graphs like Wikidata, Wikipedia, etc.).
*   **Filtering/Lens:** The user can apply “filters” or “lenses” to the Knowledge Bloom (e.g., “Show only products”, “Highlight eco-friendly options”, “Focus on expert reviews”). This alters Node weights and visibility.

**4. Dynamic Weighting & Learning:**

*   Node weights are initially assigned based on semantic similarity to the query.
*   User interaction (clicks, hovers, explore actions) continuously update Node weights.
*   A collaborative filtering algorithm learns from aggregate user behavior to refine Node connections and weights.
*   The system proactively suggests new Node connections based on user behavior and external knowledge.

**5. Pseudocode (Core Update Logic):**

```
function updateKnowledgeBloom(query, clickedNodeID) {
  // 1. Retrieve initial search results for query
  results = search(query)

  // 2. Create Context Nodes from results
  contextNodes = createContextNodes(results)

  // 3. If a node was clicked, center bloom on that node
  if (clickedNodeID) {
    selectedNode = findNodeByID(clickedNodeID)
    query = selectedNode.term
  }

  // 4. Fetch related nodes (semantic connections, user behavior)
  relatedNodes = getRelatedNodes(query, contextNodes)

  // 5. Calculate node weights (semantic similarity, user engagement)
  weightedNodes = calculateNodeWeights(relatedNodes)

  // 6. Render knowledge bloom (visual layout, node positioning)
  renderBloom(weightedNodes)
}
```

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond simple suggestions to a dynamic, visually engaging knowledge exploration tool, directly integrated into the content page. The radial layout and dynamic weighting create a richer, more intuitive search experience. The collaborative filtering aspect allows the system to learn and adapt to individual user preferences.
