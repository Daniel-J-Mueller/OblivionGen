# 9390748

## Dynamic Robotic Sorting with Predictive Placement

**System Overview:** A modular, scalable robotic system integrated with the imaging verification system described in patent 9390748. This system moves beyond simple verification of placement *after* an action, to *predictive* robotic sorting and placement *before* an agent (or another robot) fully releases the item.

**Core Innovation:** Instead of solely verifying placement in a designated container, this system anticipates the item's intended destination and utilizes a small, fast-acting robotic arm (a ‘pre-sorter’) to *initiate* the correct container’s positioning *before* the item arrives. This reduces cycle time and prevents mis-sorts.

**System Components:**

*   **Imaging System:** Existing imaging setup from patent 9390748 (used for destination identification and confirmation).
*   **Destination Prediction Module:** Software module analyzing item characteristics (from image processing and/or prior data) to predict the appropriate container/destination.  This uses a continuously updated probability map based on historical data and real-time item features.
*   **Pre-Sorter Robotic Arms:** Multiple small, high-speed robotic arms positioned above the container segments.  Each arm is dedicated to pre-positioning a limited number of containers.
*   **Container Movement System:** A network of small, independently controlled conveyor sections or linear actuators to move containers into the optimal position as directed by the Pre-Sorter system.
*   **Real-Time Adjustment System:** Constant monitoring of container positions via the imaging system, with feedback loops to the container movement system to ensure containers are *exactly* where they need to be.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Item Identification:** The imaging system identifies the item and sends data to the Destination Prediction Module.
2.  **Destination Prediction:** The Destination Prediction Module determines the most likely container for the item.
3.  **Pre-Positioning:**  The Pre-Sorter robotic arm *begins* to move the predicted container towards the optimal position, *before* the item arrives.  The movement is gradual and anticipatory, not a full repositioning.  A "ready" position is targeted.
4.  **Final Alignment:** As the item approaches, the imaging system provides real-time container position data. The container movement system makes fine adjustments to align the container perfectly.
5.  **Item Placement & Verification:** The item is placed in the container. The imaging system confirms correct placement (as in the original patent).
6.  **Cycle Repeat:** The system immediately begins predicting the destination for the next item.

**Pseudocode (Destination Prediction Module):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION predict_destination(item_data):
    // item_data contains features extracted from image processing (e.g., size, shape, color, labels)
    
    // Load historical data: item features -> container assignments
    historical_data = load_data("item_container_history.db")
    
    // Calculate probability scores for each container based on item features
    probability_scores = {}
    FOR container IN available_containers:
        probability_scores[container] = calculate_probability(item_data, container, historical_data)
    
    // Apply weighting factors (e.g., urgency, special handling)
    weighted_scores = apply_weights(probability_scores, current_system_state)
    
    // Select container with highest score
    predicted_container = max(weighted_scores, key=weighted_scores.get)
    
    RETURN predicted_container
```

**Scalability:**

The modular design allows for easy expansion.  Additional Pre-Sorter arms and container movement sections can be added to increase throughput. The system could even be deployed in a distributed network, with multiple pre-sorting modules handling different sections of the materials handling facility.

**Potential Applications:**

*   High-speed e-commerce fulfillment centers
*   Automated postal sorting facilities
*   Pharmaceutical packaging and distribution
*   Automotive parts logistics
