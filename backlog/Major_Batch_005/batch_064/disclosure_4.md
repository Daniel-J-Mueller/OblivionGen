**Adaptive Acoustic Scene Classification & Personalized Wake Word Enhancement**

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on power management triggered by keywords. This builds on that by *first* deeply understanding the acoustic environment *before* activating wake word detection, and then tailoring wake word processing based on user-specific acoustic profiles. It moves beyond simple volume/energy triggers to richer contextual awareness.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 4 mics) integrated into device.
    *   Dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for on-device machine learning.
    *   Low-power Digital Signal Processor (DSP) for pre-processing.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Scene Classifier (ASC):** Trained on a diverse dataset of acoustic environments (home, office, car, outdoors, etc.).  Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Inputs are spectrograms generated from the microphone array data. Output is a probability distribution over the defined acoustic scene classes.  Continuous learning updates model based on user location data (if permitted).
    *   **User Acoustic Profile Builder (UAPB):** Records and analyzes short snippets of the user's voice in various environments (with user consent).  Builds a personalized acoustic model including voice characteristics, common background noises, and typical speaking patterns. Uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and/or deep neural networks.
    *   **Dynamic Wake Word Processor (DWWP):** Adjusts wake word detection parameters (sensitivity, filtering, noise reduction) *based on the output of the ASC and UAPB.*  If the ASC identifies a noisy environment (e.g., restaurant), the DWWP increases noise reduction and sensitivity.  If the UAPB identifies a specific user's voice, it applies personalized filtering to improve detection accuracy.
    *   **Adaptive Sampling Rate Controller (ASRC):** Dynamically adjusts the audio sampling rate *based on the combined output of ASC, UAPB and DWWP*. Higher sampling rates in quieter environments or for recognized users. Lower sampling rates in noisy environments or for unknown voices, to conserve power.
*   **Pseudocode (ASRC):**

```
function adjustSamplingRate(acousticScene, userProfile, wakeWordConfidence) {
    baseRate = 8kHz; // Default sampling rate

    // Adjust for acoustic scene
    if (acousticScene == "quiet_home") {
        rateModifier = 1.5;
    } else if (acousticScene == "noisy_street") {
        rateModifier = 0.75;
    } else {
        rateModifier = 1.0;
    }

    // Adjust for user profile (personalized voice)
    if (userProfile.isRecognized) {
        rateModifier *= 1.2;
    }

    //Adjust for wake word confidence (pre-activation boost)
    if (wakeWordConfidence > 0.5) {
       rateModifier *= 1.1
    }
   
    newRate = baseRate * rateModifier;
    
    //Clamp to acceptable range
    if (newRate < 4kHz) {
        newRate = 4kHz;
    } else if (newRate > 16kHz) {
        newRate = 16kHz;
    }

    return newRate;
}
```

*   **Data Flow:**

    1.  Audio input from microphone array.
    2.  DSP pre-processes audio (noise reduction, filtering).
    3.  ASC classifies acoustic scene.
    4.  UAPB identifies user profile.
    5.  ASRC determines optimal sampling rate.
    6.  DWWP adjusts wake word detection parameters.
    7.  Wake word detection.
    8.  If wake word detected, activate network interface or speech recognition engine.

*   **Power Management Integration:**  Prioritize low-power operation.  Only activate the full processing pipeline (ASC, UAPB, DWWP) when audio energy exceeds a low threshold. This minimizes energy consumption while maintaining responsiveness.
