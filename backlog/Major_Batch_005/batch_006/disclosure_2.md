## Temporal Data Shadowing & Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the pre-production staging concept to maintain *multiple* shadowed versions of datasets, not just a single temporary copy. This enables predictive rollback based on emerging consistency check failures *before* committing to production. It's like time-travel debugging for data.

**Specifications:**

*   **Versioning:**  Instead of a single “temporary dataset”, the staging store maintains a time-series of ‘shadow datasets’ – `dataset_version_t1`, `dataset_version_t2`, etc. Each version represents a snapshot after a proposed modification is applied.
*   **Shadow Creation Trigger:** A new shadow dataset is created *immediately* upon receiving a modification request, *before* any consistency checks. This is a fast operation – a simple copy/write.
*   **Parallel Consistency Checks:** All consistency checks are performed against the *latest* shadow dataset.  Crucially, multiple checks can run *concurrently*.
*   **Failure Detection & Rollback Path:** If *any* consistency check fails at any stage, the system *automatically* begins a rollback process. This doesn't revert to production. It rolls back to the *last valid shadow dataset* – the previous version.
*   **Predictive Rollback Threshold:** Define a 'rollback threshold' - a count of failed consistency checks before flagging the current shadow dataset for complete deletion and cancellation of the modification request. This allows for transient errors, but prevents persistent failures from polluting the staging store.
*   **"Ghost" Dataset Analysis:**  Even if a rollback occurs, the failed shadow dataset isn’t immediately deleted. It’s retained as a “ghost dataset” for a limited period (configurable). This ghost data is available for debugging and root cause analysis. Logs are maintained detailing which consistency checks failed and when.
*   **Selective Promotion:** Once a shadow dataset passes *all* consistency checks, it’s flagged for ‘promotion’. Promotion is *not* immediate. A scheduler manages promotion in batches to minimize disruption.
*   **Data Lineage:**  Maintain a complete data lineage trace for each dataset version, including the original data source, modification history, and all consistency check results. This provides a full audit trail.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function applyModification(modificationRequest, datasetID):
  shadowDataset = createShadowDataset(datasetID)
  shadowDataset.applyModification(modificationRequest)

  consistencyCheckResults = runConsistencyChecks(shadowDataset)

  if any(consistencyCheckResults.failed):
    if count(consistencyCheckResults.failed) > rollbackThreshold:
      deleteShadowDataset(shadowDataset)
      log("Modification rejected due to persistent failures")
      return false
    else:
      log("Transient failure.  Attempting recovery...")
      //Potentially retry a specific failed check or a subset of checks.
      return false
  else:
    flagShadowDatasetForPromotion(shadowDataset)
    return true

function promoteShadowDatasets():
  //Scheduler function - batches shadow datasets for promotion to production.
  for each shadowDataset in flaggedShadowDatasets:
    //Perform final pre-promotion checks (e.g., resource availability).
    if checksPass():
      swap(shadowDataset, productionDataset)
      removeShadowDataset(shadowDataset)

```

**Rationale:**

This system goes beyond simple validation. It allows for a 'safe' experimentation process. Modifications are applied to a shadow copy *immediately*, and validation runs in parallel.  The rollback mechanism prevents bad data from ever reaching production, and the “ghost datasets” provide valuable insights into data quality issues. This is particularly important for complex datasets and applications where data integrity is critical.
