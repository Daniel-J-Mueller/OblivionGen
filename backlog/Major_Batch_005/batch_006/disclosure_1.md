## Distributed Secure Assembly with Dynamic Slice Encryption

**Concept:** Expand the idea of fragmented, encrypted file assembly (as suggested by the source patent) into a system where file *slices* are not pre-defined, but generated *dynamically* based on network conditions, client capabilities, and a threat model. Each slice is encrypted with a unique key, and the assembly process isn’t just about re-ordering, but about *reconstructing* data from potentially incomplete or altered fragments.

**Specs:**

**1. Slice Generation Module (Server-Side):**

*   **Input:** Source file, Threat Model (configurable – e.g., 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'), Client Capability Profile (bandwidth, processing power, storage).
*   **Process:**
    *   Divide source file into variable-length “data units”. These units are not necessarily contiguous blocks. The algorithm prioritizes minimizing impact of single slice loss.
    *   Employ a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) seeded with a master key, client profile, and threat model.
    *   Use the PRNG to determine:
        *   Slice Size: Variable length, dynamically adjusted based on network conditions and client capability.
        *   Data Unit Selection:  Determine which data units compose each slice.  Algorithm should prioritize spreading critical data across multiple slices.
        *   Encryption Key: Generate a unique AES-256 key for each slice, derived from the master key and slice index.
    *   Encrypt each slice with its unique key.
    *   Generate a “Slice Manifest” – a JSON file containing:
        *   Slice Index
        *   Slice Size
        *   Encryption Key (encrypted with client’s public key)
        *   SHA-256 Hash of the encrypted slice.
*   **Output:** Encrypted slices, Slice Manifest.

**2. Dynamic Assembly Client:**

*   **Input:** Slice Manifest, Network connection.
*   **Process:**
    *   Request slices from the server based on the Slice Manifest.
    *   Verify slice integrity using the SHA-256 hash in the manifest.
    *   Decrypt slices using the provided keys.
    *   Implement a 'Redundancy Request' algorithm:  If a slice download fails, or integrity check fails, the client can request redundant slices from alternate servers (if available) or request re-generation of a slice from a different source.
    *   Reassemble the file based on the Slice Manifest order.
    *   Implement a 'Missing Slice Reconstruction' algorithm: If a slice is consistently unavailable, the client attempts to reconstruct the missing data using Reed-Solomon coding (or similar error correction code).  This requires pre-generation of parity slices on the server and their inclusion in the manifest.
*   **Output:** Reconstructed source file.

**3. Key Management System:**

*   Generate and securely store a master key.
*   Distribute client public keys to the server.
*   Provide APIs for key rotation and revocation.

**Pseudocode (Client - Missing Slice Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstruct_file(manifest):
    slices = []
    for slice_index in manifest.slice_order:
        try:
            slice = download_and_verify_slice(manifest, slice_index)
            slices.append(slice)
        except DownloadError or VerificationError:
            // Attempt reconstruction
            if reconstruction_possible(manifest, slice_index):
                reconstructed_slice = reconstruct_slice(manifest, slice_index)
                slices.append(reconstructed_slice)
            else:
                // Error: Unable to reconstruct slice.
                raise ReconstructionError("Unable to reconstruct slice " + slice_index)

    return assemble_file(slices)
```

**Novelty:**  Unlike the source patent, which seems to focus on pre-defined fragments, this system *generates* slices dynamically, adding a layer of obfuscation and resilience against targeted attacks. The variable slice size and dynamic generation, combined with error correction and redundancy request, create a robust and adaptable data transfer system.  The system prioritizes resilience over simple speed.
