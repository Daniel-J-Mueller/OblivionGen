## Automated Textile Defect Prediction & Pre-Cut Adjustment

**Concept:** Integrate real-time defect prediction *before* the cutting process, leveraging advanced image analysis and machine learning to proactively adjust cutting paths and minimize fabric waste.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** High-resolution multi-spectral camera array (visible light, near-infrared) mounted above the textile cutting bed. Illumination provided by structured light projectors for depth mapping.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Continuous image capture synchronized with textile sheet positioning.  Minimum resolution: 0.1mm per pixel. Frame rate: 30 FPS.
*   **Pre-processing Module:**
    *   Noise reduction (median filtering, Gaussian blur).
    *   Geometric correction (perspective transform, distortion removal).
    *   Texture enhancement (CLAHE – Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization).
*   **Defect Detection AI:**
    *   Model Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) – specifically, a Mask R-CNN variant trained on a large dataset of textile defects (holes, stains, weave irregularities, color variations).
    *   Training Data: Dataset comprising >10,000 images of various textile types, annotated with precise defect boundaries and classifications.  Data augmentation techniques (rotation, scaling, color jitter) to enhance robustness.
    *   Output:  A pixel-wise segmentation mask identifying all defects within the scanned textile area. Confidence scores associated with each detected defect.
*   **Cutting Path Adjustment Module:**
    *   Input: Segmentation mask from the Defect Detection AI, original panel layout, desired panel quality thresholds.
    *   Algorithm:
        1.  **Defect Buffer Zone:** Define a minimum distance around each detected defect that cannot be used for panel cutting.
        2.  **Panel Repositioning:** Attempt to reposition panels to avoid the defect buffer zones.  Prioritize maintaining panel shape and orientation.
        3.  **Panel Resizing (Optional):**  If repositioning is not possible, dynamically resize panels (within acceptable tolerances) to exclude the defect area.
        4.  **Cutting Path Optimization:** Generate a new cutting path that avoids defect areas and minimizes fabric waste. Utilizes a genetic algorithm to explore multiple path configurations.
*   **Real-time Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitor cutting process and adjust cutting parameters (speed, power) based on real-time sensor data and defect predictions.
*   **System Integration:** Communicates with the textile cutter via a standardized interface (e.g., OPC UA).

**Pseudocode (Cutting Path Adjustment):**

```
function adjust_cutting_path(panel_layout, defect_mask):
  adjusted_layout = panel_layout
  for each panel in adjusted_layout:
    if panel intersects defect_mask:
      attempt repositioning(panel, defect_mask)
      if repositioning failed:
        attempt resizing(panel, defect_mask)
        if resizing failed:
          mark panel for rejection // Or implement more aggressive material salvage
      update cutting path based on new panel position/size

  return adjusted cutting path
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond post-cut defect detection and integrates proactive defect prediction *before* cutting, minimizing waste and maximizing material utilization.  The integration of a dynamic cutting path optimization algorithm based on AI-driven defect analysis represents a significant advancement in automated textile manufacturing.
