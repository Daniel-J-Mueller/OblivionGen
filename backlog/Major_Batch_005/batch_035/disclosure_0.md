## Dynamic Threat Landscape Profiling via Snapshot Variance Analysis

**Concept:** Extend snapshot-based scanning to proactively profile the threat landscape of a storage volume *before* a full scan, by analyzing the *types* of changes between snapshots, not just the blocks themselves. This allows for dynamically adjusting scan priority and depth based on the observed activity.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `ThreatProfile`: A data structure to store categorized change information. Contains:
    *   `ChangeCategory`: (Enum: `NewFile`, `ModifiedFile`, `DeletedFile`, `RelocatedFile`, `MetadataChange`, `BlockChange`)
    *   `CategoryCount`: Integer, representing the number of occurrences of this change category.
    *   `AssociatedHashes`: Set of file hashes observed within this change category.
    *   `EntropyScore`: Float, indicating the randomness of file hashes associated with this category (higher = potentially malicious).
*   `VolumeThreatProfile`: A data structure representing the accumulated ThreatProfile for a storage volume over a defined period (e.g., last 7 days). Contains:
    *   `SnapshotHistory`: List of `ThreatProfile` objects, one per snapshot.
    *   `AggregatedProfile`:  `ThreatProfile` representing the consolidated view of all snapshots in the history.

**2. System Components:**

*   **Snapshot Variance Analyzer (SVA):**  New service responsible for analyzing snapshot differences.  Operates in parallel with the existing snapshotting service.
*   **Threat Profile Database:** Persistent storage for `VolumeThreatProfile` objects.
*   **Dynamic Scan Prioritizer (DSP):**  Service responsible for adjusting scan parameters (depth, frequency, resources) based on the `VolumeThreatProfile`.

**3. Workflow:**

1.  **Snapshot Creation:** When a new snapshot is created, the snapshotting service notifies the SVA.
2.  **Variance Analysis:** The SVA retrieves the previous snapshot and compares it to the new one.  It identifies changed blocks, and importantly, categorizes *what kind of changes* occurred (new file, modified, deleted, etc.).
3.  **Profile Generation:** The SVA constructs a `ThreatProfile` for the new snapshot, including counts of each change category and the file hashes associated with those changes. Entropy is calculated for each categoryâ€™s hashes.
4.  **Profile Aggregation:** The new `ThreatProfile` is added to the `SnapshotHistory` of the `VolumeThreatProfile`. The `AggregatedProfile` is updated.
5.  **Dynamic Prioritization:** The DSP periodically analyzes the `AggregatedProfile`.
    *   **High `NewFile` count + High Hash Entropy:**  Indicates potential malware campaign. Increase scan frequency and depth for newly created files.
    *   **High `DeletedFile` count:**  Potential ransomware activity.  Prioritize scanning recent file activity and backups.
    *   **High `MetadataChange` count:**  May indicate attempted evasion techniques.  Increase inspection of file metadata.
    *   **Significant change in hash entropy over time:** Anomaly detection. Flag for deeper analysis.
6.  **Scan Adjustment:** The DSP communicates with the scanning service, providing adjusted scan parameters.

**4. Pseudocode (DSP - Analysis & Adjustment):**

```pseudocode
function analyze_volume_profile(volume_id):
    profile = retrieve_volume_threat_profile(volume_id)
    aggregated_profile = profile.aggregated_profile

    new_file_count = aggregated_profile.category_count[NewFile]
    new_file_entropy = aggregated_profile.entropy_score[NewFile]
    deleted_file_count = aggregated_profile.category_count[DeletedFile]
    // ... other category analysis ...

    if new_file_count > threshold AND new_file_entropy > entropy_threshold:
        scan_priority = HIGH
        scan_depth = DEEP
        scan_focus = NEW_FILES
    elif deleted_file_count > deleted_threshold:
        scan_priority = HIGH
        scan_depth = MEDIUM
        scan_focus = RECENT_ACTIVITY
    else:
        scan_priority = NORMAL
        scan_depth = DEFAULT
        scan_focus = FULL_VOLUME

    update_scan_parameters(volume_id, scan_priority, scan_depth, scan_focus)

```

**5. Scalability Considerations:**

*   SVA can be parallelized to analyze snapshots concurrently.
*   Threat Profile Database should be horizontally scalable.
*   Caching mechanisms can be used to reduce database load.

This system moves beyond simply scanning changed blocks and *understands* the nature of the changes, allowing for proactive and adaptive threat detection.
