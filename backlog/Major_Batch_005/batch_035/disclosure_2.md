## Dynamic Task Cloning & Parallel Execution with Resource-Aware Scheduling

**Specification:** A system extension enabling dynamic cloning of workflow tasks and their parallel execution across heterogeneous resources, guided by real-time resource availability and task dependency analysis.

**Concept:**  The provided patent focuses on *selecting* an execution resource. This design pushes beyond selection, to *replication* and adaptive distribution for maximizing throughput. If a task isn't immediately bottlenecked by dependencies, the system proactively creates multiple instances.

**Components:**

*   **Task Cloning Engine:**  Responsible for creating identical copies of a task, each with a unique identifier. Cloning occurs *before* resource allocation, generating potential execution paths.
*   **Dependency Graph Analyzer:**  Continuously monitors task dependencies, identifying tasks eligible for cloning (i.e., those without unresolved input dependencies).
*   **Resource Availability Monitor:** Tracks the capacity of various execution resources (CPU, memory, GPU, network bandwidth) in real-time.  This includes both internal resources and external cloud services.
*   **Adaptive Scheduler:**  The core component. It receives input from the Dependency Graph Analyzer and Resource Availability Monitor.  The scheduler evaluates multiple execution plans, considering:
    *   Estimated task duration.
    *   Resource constraints.
    *   Data transfer costs.
    *   Potential for parallel execution.
*   **Execution Coordinator:** Dispatches cloned tasks to available resources according to the Adaptive Scheduler's plan.  Manages inter-task communication and data exchange.
*   **Result Aggregator:** Collects results from completed task instances.  Implements a fault-tolerance mechanism (e.g., selecting the first valid result, averaging results, or triggering re-execution of failed instances).

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Scheduler):**

```
function schedule_tasks(task_list, resource_pool):
    cloned_tasks = clone_eligible_tasks(task_list)  //Identify and clone tasks without dependencies
    
    execution_plans = generate_execution_plans(cloned_tasks, resource_pool) //Generate possible plans
    
    best_plan = select_best_plan(execution_plans) //Criteria: minimize completion time, resource usage

    for task in best_plan.tasks:
        dispatch_task(task, best_plan.resource)

    monitor_execution(best_plan) //Track progress and handle failures

function generate_execution_plans(tasks, resources):
    plans = []
    for task in tasks:
        for resource in resources:
            plan = create_plan(task, resource)
            plans.append(plan)
    return plans

function create_plan(task, resource):
    plan = {}
    plan['task'] = task
    plan['resource'] = resource
    plan['estimated_completion_time'] = estimate_task_duration(task, resource)
    return plan

function estimate_task_duration(task, resource):
    //Complex model based on task properties and resource capabilities
    //Include network latency, data transfer rates, etc.
    return time_estimate

```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Task`:  Contains task code, input/output specifications, resource requirements, and status.
*   `Resource`:  Represents an execution resource with properties like CPU cores, memory, GPU type, network bandwidth, and cost.
*   `ExecutionPlan`:  A list of task-resource assignments with an estimated completion time and cost.

**Novelty:**

Existing systems typically focus on *static* workflow scheduling and resource allocation. This design introduces *dynamic* task cloning and adaptive scheduling based on real-time resource availability and task dependencies. It enables a higher degree of parallelism and potentially significantly reduces workflow completion time. Furthermore, it adds a layer of self-optimization. The system proactively replicates tasks *before* bottlenecks are identified, mitigating the risk of delays.
