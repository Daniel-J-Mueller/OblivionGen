## Adaptive Acoustic Camouflage - Earbud Extension

**Concept:** Earbuds that actively mimic surrounding soundscapes to create an auditory "camouflage" effect, enhancing situational awareness *and* offering a novel form of active noise *shaping* rather than cancellation.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Six (6) MEMS microphones integrated into the earbud housing. Four (4) facing outward (one anterior, one posterior, one superior, one inferior) and two (2) inward facing towards the ear canal.
*   **Audio Processing Unit:** Dedicated low-power DSP capable of real-time FFT analysis and synthesis. Minimum 200 MHz clock speed.
*   **Speaker Drivers:** Dual balanced armature drivers per earbud – one for playback of intended audio, one dedicated to camouflage signal generation.
*   **Environmental Sound Analysis:**
    *   Continuous FFT analysis of ambient sound captured by external microphones.
    *   Algorithm to identify dominant frequencies and sound "texture" (e.g., speech, music, traffic).
    *   Priority assigned to sound sources. Human speech highest, followed by emergency vehicle sirens, then general environmental noise.
*   **Camouflage Signal Generation:**
    *   DSP synthesizes audio signal mirroring detected ambient sounds.
    *   Signal is frequency-shifted & amplitude-adjusted to *blend* with surrounding environment, masking the presence of the earbud itself.  Not complete replication – a subtly altered “echo” of the environment.
    *   Signal fed *exclusively* to the dedicated camouflage driver.
*   **Playback Audio Integration:**
    *   User-selected audio stream is mixed with the camouflage signal.
    *   Dynamic gain control adjusts playback volume based on ambient sound levels, ensuring audibility without disrupting camouflage effect.
*   **Modes of Operation:**
    *   **Stealth:**  Camouflage signal prioritized. Playback audio minimized.
    *   **Awareness:**  Balance between playback audio and camouflage. User adjustable.
    *   **Transparency:** Camouflage signal disabled. Direct pass-through of ambient sound.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable lithium-ion battery providing minimum 8 hours of operation. Wireless charging capable.
*   **Connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.3.
*   **Housing:** 3D printed, bio-compatible resin. Modular design allows for easy component replacement and customization.
*   **Algorithm Detail – Priority Mixing:**

```pseudocode
function mixAudio(ambientSound, playbackSound, priority) {
  // priority: 0-1 (0 = prioritize ambient, 1 = prioritize playback)

  ambientGain = 1 - priority
  playbackGain = priority

  mixedSignal = (ambientSound * ambientGain) + (playbackSound * playbackGain)

  return mixedSignal
}

function analyzeEnvironment() {
    //Capture sound from external microphones
    ambientSound = captureAmbientSound()

    //Identify dominant frequencies & sound textures
    frequencySpectrum = analyzeFrequency(ambientSound)
    soundTexture = identifySoundTexture(frequencySpectrum)

    //Assign Priority (example logic)
    if (soundTexture == "Speech") {
        priority = 0.2 //Prioritize ambient speech
    } else if (soundTexture == "Sirens") {
        priority = 0.1
    } else {
        priority = 0.5 //Balance
    }

    return priority
}

function generateCamouflageSignal(ambientSound) {
    //Process the ambient sound
    processedSignal = processAmbientSound(ambientSound)

    //Apply frequency shifting
    shiftedSignal = applyFrequencyShift(processedSignal, 50Hz) //Shift by 50Hz

    //Adjust amplitude
    scaledSignal = scaleAmplitude(shiftedSignal, 0.7) //Reduce amplitude to 70%

    return scaledSignal
}

// Main loop
while (true) {
  priority = analyzeEnvironment()
  camouflageSignal = generateCamouflageSignal(capturedAmbientSound)

  mixedSignal = mixAudio(camouflageSignal, playbackSound, priority)
  outputAudio(mixedSignal)
}
