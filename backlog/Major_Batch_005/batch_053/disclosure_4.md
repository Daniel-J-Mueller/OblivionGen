## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Profiling for Personalized Wake Word Detection

**Concept:** Extend wake word detection beyond simple keyword spotting by creating dynamic acoustic scene profiles linked to user behavior and environment. This allows for more robust detection in noisy or complex environments, and reduces false positives/negatives.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Feature Extraction:**

*   **Multi-Modal Input:** Integrate audio input with data from device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, ambient light). This provides contextual clues about the userâ€™s activity and location.
*   **Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC):** Employ a real-time ASC model (trained on diverse audio datasets) to classify the current acoustic environment (e.g., home, office, car, outdoors).
*   **User Activity Recognition:**  Utilize sensor data to recognize user activities (e.g., walking, driving, cooking, watching TV). Implement a sensor fusion algorithm (Kalman filtering or similar) to combine data and improve accuracy.
*   **Feature Vector Construction:** Combine ASC output, user activity recognition results, and traditional acoustic features (MFCCs, spectrograms) into a comprehensive feature vector.

**2. Dynamic Profile Generation & Management:**

*   **Profile Database:** Maintain a database of acoustic scene profiles for each user. Each profile stores statistical information about feature vectors observed in different acoustic scenes and user activities. (e.g., mean, variance, covariance of acoustic features).
*   **Online Learning:** Continuously update profiles based on real-time data. Implement an incremental learning algorithm (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent) to adapt to changing environments and user behavior.
*   **Contextual Switching:** Automatically switch between profiles based on the current acoustic scene and user activity. Use a Bayesian network or Markov model to predict the most likely profile given the current context.
*    **Profile Blending:** When transitioning between acoustic scenes, blend profiles instead of abruptly switching. This provides a smoother and more robust detection experience.

**3. Wake Word Detection Engine:**

*   **Adaptive Thresholding:**  Use profile information to adjust the detection threshold for the wake word. In noisy environments, increase the threshold to reduce false positives. In quiet environments, decrease the threshold to improve sensitivity.
*   **Profile-Specific Models:** Train separate wake word detection models for each profile. This allows the engine to learn the specific characteristics of the wake word in different environments.
*   **Weighted Feature Combination:** Assign weights to different features based on their relevance to the current profile. For example, in a car environment, prioritize features related to engine noise and road traffic.
*   **Confidence Scoring:** Output a confidence score for each wake word detection. Use this score to filter out false positives and improve overall accuracy.

**Pseudocode - Adaptive Thresholding:**

```
function calculate_detection_threshold(current_profile, base_threshold) {
  noise_level = current_profile.average_noise_level;
  threshold_adjustment = noise_level * scaling_factor;
  adjusted_threshold = base_threshold + threshold_adjustment;
  return adjusted_threshold;
}

function detect_wake_word(audio_data, current_profile) {
  threshold = calculate_detection_threshold(current_profile, base_threshold);
  detection_score = calculate_wake_word_score(audio_data);

  if (detection_score > threshold) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Microphone array for improved noise cancellation.
*   On-device processing capabilities for real-time feature extraction and profile management.
*   Connectivity to cloud services for model updates and data synchronization (optional).
