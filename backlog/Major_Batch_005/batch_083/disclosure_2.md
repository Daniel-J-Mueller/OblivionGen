## Adaptive Contextual Highlighting & Action System

**Concept:** Expand the "text unit" concept to not only visually differentiate but *proactively* offer actions based on identified context *within* the unit, adapting over time based on user interaction.

**Specs:**

**1. Context Engine:**

*   **Input:** Encoded text block (as per patent 9424249).
*   **Process:** Beyond label assignment (location, tracking number, etc.), the Context Engine analyzes the text unit for semantic meaning using a lightweight NLP model. This model isn't full comprehension, but focuses on *actionable* keywords and relationships. Examples:
    *   "Meeting with John tomorrow at 2 PM" – identifies "meeting", "John", "tomorrow", "2 PM".
    *   "Order #12345 shipped via FedEx" – identifies "order", "#12345", "shipped", "FedEx".
*   **Output:**  A context vector associated with the text unit, detailing identified actionable elements and their relationships.

**2. Dynamic Action Palette:**

*   **Input:** Context vector, User profile (preferences, frequently used apps, history).
*   **Process:** Based on the context vector and user profile, a dynamic action palette is generated *associated with the text unit*. This palette displays relevant actions as icons or brief text. Examples:
    *   For "Meeting with John tomorrow at 2 PM": "Add to Calendar", "Email John", "Find John's Contact Info", "Directions to Meeting Location".
    *   For "Order #12345 shipped via FedEx": "Track Package", "View Order Details", "Contact FedEx", "Initiate Return".
*   **Output:** A list of actionable items.  The list dynamically reorders based on user frequency of selection.

**3. Selection & Action Triggering:**

*   **Existing functionality:**  Preserve the existing "select subset -> select entire unit" mechanism.
*   **New functionality:**
    *   **Hover/Long Press:** Display the dynamic action palette when hovering or long-pressing the text unit.
    *   **Quick Select:** Implement a "quick select" function where frequently used actions are directly accessible with a single click/tap (determined by usage history).
    *   **Contextual Menu:** If no action is selected within a defined time, display a contextual menu offering the full action palette.

**4. Learning & Adaptation:**

*   **User Action Logging:** Track all user interactions with the action palette (selections, dismissals, ignored actions).
*   **Model Retraining:** Use the logged data to retrain the lightweight NLP model, improving the accuracy of actionable element identification and the relevance of the action palette.  This could be done locally (privacy-preserving) or via a federated learning approach.
*   **Personalization:**  Adapt the action palette based on individual user behavior and preferences.

**Pseudocode (Action Palette Generation):**

```
function generateActionPalette(contextVector, userProfile) {
  actionCandidates = [];

  // Identify potential actions based on context vector
  if (contextVector.has("meeting")) {
    actionCandidates.add("Add to Calendar");
    actionCandidates.add("Email Participants");
  }
  if (contextVector.has("order_number")) {
    actionCandidates.add("Track Package");
    actionCandidates.add("View Order Details");
  }

  // Filter actions based on user profile (preferred apps, etc.)
  filteredActions = filterActions(actionCandidates, userProfile);

  // Sort actions based on usage history (most frequent first)
  sortedActions = sortActions(filteredActions, userHistory);

  return sortedActions;
}
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Lightweight NLP model for real-time processing.
*   Secure user profile and history storage.
*   Integration with common calendar, email, and package tracking applications.
*   Cross-platform compatibility (desktop, mobile).
