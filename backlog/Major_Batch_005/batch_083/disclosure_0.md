## Modular Expansion Plane System

**Concept:** Expand the concept of aligned expansion slots to encompass a fully modular, multi-planar expansion system for PCBs. Instead of limiting expansion to the same plane as the motherboard, create a system where expansion 'modules' can be stacked or arranged *around* the motherboard, connected via high-speed, low-latency interconnects.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** A standardized ‘core module’ PCB. This module provides power delivery, cooling (liquid or air), and a high-bandwidth interface (e.g., modified PCIe 6.0 or a custom protocol) to connect to the host motherboard. Dimensions: 100mm x 100mm x 20mm.
*   **Expansion Module Types:** A variety of ‘expansion modules’ designed for specific functions (GPU, FPGA, Storage, Networking, Custom). Each module connects to the core module via a standardized connector.
*   **Core Module Connector:** A multi-lane connector (minimum 64 lanes, capable of scaling to 128 or 256) providing both data and power.  Connector type: Custom, high-density, mechanically robust. Pin pitch: 0.5mm.
*   **Stacking Mechanism:**  Modules and core modules have integrated mechanical connectors (magnetic alignment + physical locking) allowing vertical or horizontal stacking. Stacking height limited to 150mm.
*   **Cooling System:** Core module includes a microfluidic channel (for liquid cooling) or a high-efficiency heat pipe system connecting to a shared heat sink.  Fanless operation preferred for noise reduction.
*   **Power Delivery:** Core module distributes power to all connected expansion modules.  Each module draws power dynamically based on its needs.  Power budget per module: 300W.
*   **Interconnect Protocol:** A custom, low-latency protocol built on top of PCIe or a similar high-speed serial interface.  Focus on minimizing overhead and maximizing bandwidth.
*   **Software Interface:** A unified driver framework allowing the host operating system to manage all connected expansion modules as a single logical unit.

**Pseudocode (Software Driver Framework):**

```
Class ExpansionModuleManager:
  Initialize():
    Detect available Expansion Modules connected to the system.
    Load drivers for each module.
    Create a virtualized view of all modules.

  GetModule(ModuleID):
    Return a reference to the requested module.

  SendData(ModuleID, Data):
    Route data to the specified module via the high-speed interconnect.

  ReceiveData(ModuleID, Data):
    Process data received from the specified module.
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond the limitations of a planar motherboard expansion and allows for true 3D expansion.  It also facilitates modular upgrades and customization. The system would allow expansion without physical size limitations of the motherboard.
