## Adaptive Credential Chains & Reputation Scoring

**Specification:** A system that dynamically constructs and evaluates “credential chains” based on user behavior, resource sensitivity, and external reputation data, going beyond simple multi-factor authentication.

**Core Concept:** Instead of solely relying on static credentials (password + OTP), the system builds a chain of increasingly verified identities and trust indicators.  Each 'link' in the chain represents a different authentication factor *and* a dynamic trust score.

**Components:**

1.  **Trust Broker Service:** A central service responsible for evaluating and scoring trust links. It ingests data from multiple sources (see below).

2.  **Dynamic Trust Link Types:**
    *   **Behavioral Biometrics:** Continuous monitoring of typing speed, mouse movements, scrolling patterns, and app usage. (Existing, but crucial)
    *   **Geolocation Context:** Validates login location against historical patterns and expected locations.
    *   **Device Trust Score:** Leverages device fingerprinting, OS integrity checks, and known vulnerability databases.
    *   **Social Graph Verification:** (Novel) –  Connects to verified social accounts (LinkedIn, Twitter) and assesses the user’s network size, connections to trusted entities, and content engagement patterns. A user with a large, verified network of professionals receives a higher score.
    *   **Reputation Score:** (Novel) – Integrates with decentralized identity and reputation systems (e.g., blockchain-based reputation platforms) to assess the user's trustworthiness based on past interactions and validations across different services.
    *   **Resource-Specific Risk Profiles:** Each secured resource (application, data set) has a defined risk profile.  The required strength of the credential chain is dynamically adjusted based on this profile. (High-risk resources require a longer, stronger chain).

3.  **Credential Chain Construction Engine:**
    *   Upon login attempt, the engine assesses the resource’s risk profile.
    *   It dynamically selects a set of trust link types to be included in the chain.
    *   It requests the necessary data from the corresponding services.
    *   The Trust Broker Service evaluates each link and assigns a trust score (0-100).
    *   The engine calculates a *cumulative chain score*.

4.  **Adaptive Access Control:**
    *   Access is granted or denied based on the cumulative chain score exceeding a predefined threshold.
    *   For borderline cases, the system can trigger step-up authentication (e.g., biometric verification) or request additional information.
    *   The system continuously monitors user behavior and adjusts the chain strength in real-time.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function authenticate(user, resource) {

  resourceRisk = getResourceRisk(resource)
  requiredChainStrength = calculateRequiredStrength(resourceRisk)

  chain = buildCredentialChain(user, requiredChainStrength)

  cumulativeScore = 0
  for each link in chain {
    linkScore = trustBroker.evaluateLink(link)
    cumulativeScore += linkScore
  }

  if (cumulativeScore >= threshold) {
    grantAccess()
  } else {
    triggerStepUpAuthentication()
  }
}

function buildCredentialChain(user, strength) {
  chain = []
  //Add base factors (password, OTP)
  //Based on strength, add:
  if (strength > 50) {
    addBehavioralBiometrics(chain)
  }
  if (strength > 75) {
    addGeolocationContext(chain)
  }
  if (strength > 90) {
    addSocialGraphVerification(chain)
    addReputationScore(chain)
  }
  return chain
}
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond static authentication factors and creates a dynamic, layered security model that adapts to the user’s behavior, the resource’s sensitivity, and the user’s reputation. The inclusion of social graph and reputation scores provides a more holistic view of user trustworthiness, mitigating risks associated with compromised credentials. It introduces a continually re-evaluated trust score rather than a simple 'pass' or 'fail'. This encourages proactive trust building and provides more nuanced access control.
