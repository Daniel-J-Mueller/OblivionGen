## Dynamic Sensitivity Layers & Predictive Redaction

**Concept:** Expand upon the sensitivity designation idea in the patent to introduce 'sensitivity layers' and *predictive* redaction based on user context & behavioral analysis. Instead of simply identifying *what* is sensitive, the system learns *how* sensitivity manifests for individual users and proactively tailors responses.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensitivity Layer Definition:** Define a hierarchical sensitivity layer system beyond simple 'sensitive' / 'not sensitive'.  Layers could include: ‘Public’, ‘Limited Access’, ‘Confidential’, ‘Highly Confidential’, ‘Personal - Family’, ‘Personal - Financial’, ‘Personal - Medical’. Each layer dictates redaction/presentation rules.
*   **User Sensitivity Profile (USP):**
    *   Data Collection: Monitor user interactions (voice commands, text input, app usage) to build a USP. Analyze phrasing, topics discussed, and the frequency/duration of inquiries related to sensitive topics.
    *   Behavioral Modeling: Employ machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks) to predict the *likelihood* a user will consider a specific piece of information sensitive *even if the originating application doesn't explicitly designate it as such*.
    *   Contextual Awareness: Integrate real-world context (location, time of day, connected devices, calendar events) to refine sensitivity predictions. Example: A request for ‘bank balance’ is likely highly sensitive. A request for ‘local weather’ is not.
*   **Predictive Redaction Engine:**
    *   Data Interception: Intercept response data *before* it’s fully processed.
    *   USP Correlation: Cross-reference response data with the user’s USP to identify potential sensitivity triggers.
    *   Layer Assignment: Dynamically assign sensitivity layers to portions of the response based on USP correlation and contextual analysis.
    *   Redaction/Modification: Apply appropriate redaction/modification rules based on the assigned sensitivity layer. This could include:
        *   Complete redaction (blacking out information).
        *   Partial redaction (replacing specific words or phrases with placeholders).
        *   Summarization (providing a general overview without revealing specific details).
        *   Obfuscation (altering the data to make it less easily identifiable).
        *   Substitution (replacing sensitive data with anonymized alternatives).
*   **Adaptive Learning Loop:**
    *   User Feedback: Implement a mechanism for users to provide feedback on the accuracy of sensitivity predictions and redaction decisions (e.g., thumbs up/down on responses).
    *   Model Retraining: Continuously retrain the machine learning models based on user feedback and new data, improving the accuracy of sensitivity predictions over time.
*   **SSML Extension:** Develop an SSML tag extension to allow applications to provide ‘hints’ about potential sensitivity beyond a simple designation.  Example: `<sensitivity type="financial" level="high">` 

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On Receiving Response Data from Application

// 1. Analyze Response Data for inherent sensitivity tags
SensitivityTags = ExtractSensitivityTags(ResponseData)

// 2. Retrieve User Sensitivity Profile (USP)
USP = GetUserSensitivityProfile(UserID)

// 3. Predict Sensitivity based on USP & Response Data
PredictedSensitivity = PredictSensitivity(ResponseData, USP)

// 4. Combine inherent tags & predicted sensitivity
CombinedSensitivity = MergeSensitivityData(SensitivityTags, PredictedSensitivity)

// 5. Apply Redaction/Modification Rules
RedactedData = ApplyRedactionRules(ResponseData, CombinedSensitivity)

// 6. Deliver RedactedData to User
SendResponse(RedactedData)

// 7. Log interaction & User Feedback for Model Retraining
LogInteraction(UserID, ResponseData, RedactedData, UserFeedback)
