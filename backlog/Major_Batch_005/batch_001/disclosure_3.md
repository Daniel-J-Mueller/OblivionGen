## Dynamic Antenna Phasing via Proximity-Driven Beamforming

**Concept:** Instead of *reducing* transmit power based on proximity, leverage the proximity sensor data to *shape* the antenna's radiation pattern through dynamic beamforming. This allows for focused energy transmission towards the user/intended receiver, minimizing interference and maximizing signal strength *without* necessarily reducing overall power. It moves beyond simply lowering power to intelligently *directing* it.

**Specs:**

*   **Antenna Array:** Replace the single antenna with a phased array antenna. Minimum of 4 elements, ideally 8 or 16, to allow for granular beam steering. Elements should be relatively small to allow for physical placement within a standard device form factor.
*   **Proximity Sensor Integration:** Utilize the existing three (or more) proximity sensors, but re-purpose their data. Instead of thresholds for power reduction, the readings will be mapped to phase shifts applied to each antenna element.
*   **Phase Shift Mapping Algorithm:** A core component. This algorithm determines the optimal phase shift for each element based on the proximity readings.
    *   Input: Raw proximity sensor readings (3+ values).
    *   Processing:
        1.  Normalize proximity readings to a 0-1 scale.
        2.  Calculate a “center of proximity” based on weighted averages of the sensors. Sensors closer to the edge of the device have higher weight.
        3.  Map the “center of proximity” coordinates to angular beam steering offsets.  e.g., Center closer to the left edge -> steer beam slightly left.  Center high up -> steer beam upwards.
        4.  Calculate phase shifts for each antenna element based on the desired beam steering angles. Utilize established beamforming equations (e.g., using cosine functions to determine phase delays).
        5.  Account for multipath effects based on device orientation. The device could potentially utilize an internal IMU or accelerometer to identify orientation and dynamically adjust the phase shifts for optimal signal propagation.
    *   Output: A vector of phase shift values (one for each antenna element).
*   **Real-time Phase Control:** Implement a high-speed digital phase shifter circuit for each antenna element. These circuits must be capable of applying the calculated phase shifts with minimal latency (target < 10 microseconds).
*   **Calibration Routine:** A baseline calibration routine to compensate for manufacturing variations in antenna element positioning and phase shifter characteristics. This can be performed during device manufacturing or as part of a self-calibration procedure during runtime.
*   **Feedback Loop (Optional):** Integrate a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) or similar metric to create a feedback loop. The algorithm could dynamically adjust phase shifts to maximize signal strength at the receiver. This could use a low power beacon signal to confirm successful communication.
*   **Power Budget:** While not necessarily *reducing* overall power, manage power consumption of the phase shifters themselves. Implement a duty cycle or power gating scheme to minimize power draw when beam steering is not actively required.

**Pseudocode (Phase Shift Calculation):**

```
// Input: proximityReadings (array of normalized distances), deviceOrientation (IMU data)

centerOfProximityX = weightedAverage(proximityReadings[0], proximityReadings[1], proximityReadings[2])  // Example for 3 sensors
centerOfProximityY = weightedAverage(proximityReadings[3], proximityReadings[4])

steeringAngleX = map(centerOfProximityX, 0, 1, -30, 30) // Map to steering angle range (degrees)
steeringAngleY = map(centerOfProximityY, 0, 1, -30, 30)

// Apply orientation correction
correctedSteeringAngleX = steeringAngleX + deviceOrientation.roll
correctedSteeringAngleY = steeringAngleY + deviceOrientation.pitch

// Calculate phase shift for each element (simplified)
for each element in antennaArray:
    phaseShift = (correctedSteeringAngleX * element.xPosition) + (correctedSteeringAngleY * element.yPosition)
    applyPhaseShift(element, phaseShift)
```

**Novelty:**  This approach moves beyond simply limiting transmission power to dynamically shaping the radiated signal. The use of proximity data for *beamforming* allows for targeted energy transmission, potentially improving signal quality, reducing interference, and maximizing battery life. The orientation correction adds another layer of sophistication to the algorithm.
