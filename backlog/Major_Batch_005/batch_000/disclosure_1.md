**Autonomous Vehicle Swarm Discrepancy Mapping & Collective Trust Assessment**

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Each unmanned vehicle (UAV, UGV, USV) equipped with:
    *   High-precision IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
    *   Multi-band GNSS receiver (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou)
    *   Barometric altimeter
    *   LiDAR or stereo vision for localized mapping
    *   Secure, low-latency mesh network radio (802.11ad/WiGig or similar)
    *   Edge computing unit (capable of running discrepancy analysis algorithms)
*   **Software:**
    *   **Discrepancy Analysis Module:**  Runs on each vehicle. Calculates discrepancy scores between:
        *   External Navigation Data (GNSS) vs. Internal Navigation Data (IMU, Barometer, LiDAR/Vision odometry).  Discrepancy score based on Kalman filtering/sensor fusion, weighting sensors based on accuracy and environmental conditions.
        *   Internal Navigation Data vs. Locally generated map data.  Discrepancy based on feature matching and pose estimation.
    *   **Trust Propagation Module:** Securely broadcasts discrepancy scores and sensor health data to neighboring vehicles within mesh network range.  Uses a Byzantine fault tolerance protocol (e.g., Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance â€“ PBFT) to filter malicious or faulty data.
    *   **Collective Trust Map:**  Each vehicle maintains a localized 'trust map' representing the estimated reliability of external navigation data (GNSS) within its vicinity. Trust map is updated continuously based on received discrepancy scores and filtered data from neighboring vehicles.
    *   **Autonomous Navigation Controller:**  Dynamically adjusts reliance on external vs. internal navigation data based on the Collective Trust Map.  Seamlessly transitions between GNSS-guided and sensor-fusion-based navigation.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies localized areas of consistently high discrepancy, indicating potential GNSS spoofing, jamming, or signal degradation.

**Pseudocode (Navigation Controller):**

```
function navigate(destination):
  trust_level = get_trust_level(current_location)

  if trust_level > threshold_high:
    // GNSS is reliable. Use GNSS-guided navigation.
    navigate_using_gnss(destination)
  else if trust_level > threshold_medium:
    // GNSS may be unreliable. Blend GNSS with sensor fusion.
    blend_gnss_and_sensor_fusion(destination, blending_factor=0.6) // 60% GNSS, 40% Sensor Fusion
  else:
    // GNSS is highly unreliable. Rely entirely on sensor fusion.
    navigate_using_sensor_fusion(destination)

  report_navigation_data(current_location, navigation_mode) // For Collective Trust Map updates
```

**Innovation Details:**

This system moves beyond individual vehicle discrepancy detection to create a *collective intelligence* network. By sharing and validating discrepancy data amongst a swarm of vehicles, it significantly improves the robustness against spoofing and enhances navigation accuracy in contested or degraded environments. The dynamic blending of navigation sources allows the swarm to adapt to changing conditions in real-time.  The system leverages the redundancy of the swarm to create a much higher confidence level in navigation data than is possible with a single vehicle. It is designed for scenarios like precision agriculture, search and rescue, infrastructure inspection, and autonomous delivery in urban canyons.  The collective trust map is a novel output, visualizing areas of GNSS unreliability and enabling proactive mitigation.
