## Dynamic Task Swarming & Skill-Based Pricing

**System Overview:** A system that dynamically aggregates tasks from multiple requesters, identifying sub-tasks based on required skillsets, then ‘swarms’ those sub-tasks to available performers *while simultaneously* adjusting pricing based on performer skill level and task urgency. This expands beyond simple task grouping and pace management.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Task Decomposition Engine:** Analyzes incoming tasks (potentially complex) and breaks them down into atomic sub-tasks, tagging each with required skills (e.g., “image labeling – automotive,” “data entry – legal,” “code review – Python”).  Skill tagging isn’t fixed; it’s dynamically learned from performer performance data (see below).
2.  **Skill Matrix & Performer Profiling:**  Maintains a dynamic skill matrix of all registered performers.  Performer skill levels are *not* self-reported.  They are determined by:
    *   **Performance Evaluation:**  Automated (where possible) and human-in-the-loop evaluation of task completion quality.
    *   **Speed of Completion:** Tasks completed faster (with acceptable quality) indicate higher skill.
    *   **Complexity Handled:** The most complex tasks a performer successfully completes become part of their skill profile.
    *   **Skill Decay:**  Skills are 'decayed' over time if not actively used, requiring performers to demonstrate continued competency.
3.  **Swarm Coordinator:**  When a decomposed task enters the system:
    *   Identifies the sub-tasks.
    *   Queries the Skill Matrix for performers matching *each* sub-task’s requirements.
    *   Prioritizes performers based on skill level, availability, and historical performance.
    *   Assigns sub-tasks to the most suitable performers, forming a ‘swarm’ working concurrently on the overall task.
4.  **Dynamic Pricing Engine:**  Pricing is *not* fixed upfront. It is calculated in real-time based on:
    *   **Skill Level:** Higher-skilled performers command higher prices per sub-task.
    *   **Task Urgency:**  Tasks with tighter deadlines incur a price premium.
    *   **Swarm Demand:**  If demand for performers with a specific skill is high, prices increase.
    *   **Task Complexity:** More complex sub-tasks are priced higher.
    *   **Market Rate Adjustment:** Pricing adjusts based on real-time market data of similar tasks.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Pricing Engine):**

```
function calculatePrice(subTask, performerSkillLevel, taskUrgency, swarmDemand, taskComplexity, marketRate) {

  basePrice = marketRate * taskComplexity // Start with market rate adjusted for task complexity

  skillMultiplier = 1 + (performerSkillLevel * 0.2) // Higher skill = higher multiplier (up to 20%)

  urgencyMultiplier = 1 + (taskUrgency * 0.1) // Higher urgency = higher multiplier (up to 10%)

  demandMultiplier = 1 + (swarmDemand * 0.05) // High demand = slight price increase

  finalPrice = basePrice * skillMultiplier * urgencyMultiplier * demandMultiplier

  //Minimum and Maximum price caps (configurable)
  if (finalPrice < minPrice) {
    finalPrice = minPrice
  }
  if (finalPrice > maxPrice) {
    finalPrice = maxPrice
  }
  return finalPrice
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Task:** {taskID, description, requiredSkills, deadline, requesterID}
*   **SubTask:** {subtaskID, taskID, description, requiredSkill, deadline, price}
*   **Performer:** {performerID, skills (list of skill/level pairs), availability, performanceMetrics}

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The system requires a robust API for task submission and performer registration.
*   Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict task completion time and optimize swarm formation.
*   Real-time monitoring of swarm performance is crucial for dynamic pricing and task allocation.
*   A dispute resolution mechanism is needed to handle disagreements between requesters and performers.
