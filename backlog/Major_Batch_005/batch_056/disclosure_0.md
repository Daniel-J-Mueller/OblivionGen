## Virtual Network ‘Shadowing’ for Security Auditing & Threat Response

**Concept:** Extend the virtual network creation/management capabilities to allow for real-time ‘shadowing’ of production virtual networks, creating ephemeral, identical copies for security analysis and threat response exercises without impacting live services.

**Specs:**

1.  **Shadow Network Trigger:** Implement a system trigger (API call, UI action, or automated rule) to initiate a ‘shadow’ copy of an existing virtual network. This trigger captures the complete network configuration – virtual machine definitions, network topology, security group rules, routing tables, and communication manager settings.
2.  **Ephemeral Network Creation:**  Upon trigger, the system automatically provisions a completely separate virtual network based on the captured configuration. This shadow network exists in parallel to the production network, utilizing the same underlying server infrastructure if available, but logically isolated.
3.  **Traffic Mirroring/Redirection:** Configure a mechanism to mirror (copy) or redirect (duplicate and forward) network traffic from the production network to the shadow network. This mirroring should be configurable at a granular level – specific virtual machines, protocols, ports, or traffic flows.
4.  **Analysis Tools Integration:** Integrate the shadow network with security analysis tools – intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), malware analysis sandboxes, and packet capture/analysis tools. These tools operate *exclusively* on the mirrored/redirected traffic within the shadow network.
5.  **Threat Response Simulation:**  Allow security engineers to simulate threat scenarios within the shadow network – deploy honeypots, test firewall rules, practice incident response procedures – without impacting production services.
6.  **Automated Correlation:** Develop algorithms to correlate alerts and events from the shadow network analysis tools with production network data, identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities.
7.  **Ephemeral Network Deletion:**  Implement an automatic deletion mechanism for the shadow network after a specified duration or upon completion of the analysis/simulation. This ensures resource efficiency and prevents data accumulation.
8.  **Configuration Versioning:** Maintain a history of shadow network configurations, allowing for rollback to previous states or comparison of different configurations.
9.  **API Access:** Provide an API for programmatically creating, managing, and analyzing shadow networks.
10. **Resource Allocation Policies:** Implement policies to limit the resources allocated to shadow networks, preventing them from consuming excessive resources.

**Pseudocode (Shadow Network Creation):**

```
function createShadowNetwork(productionNetworkID, mirroringMode, duration):
    // mirroringMode: "mirror" (copy traffic) or "redirect" (duplicate & forward)
    // duration: Time (in minutes) for the shadow network to exist

    shadowNetworkConfig = getNetworkConfig(productionNetworkID)
    shadowNetworkID = provisionNewNetwork(shadowNetworkConfig)

    if mirroringMode == "mirror":
        configureTrafficMirroring(productionNetworkID, shadowNetworkID)
    else if mirroringMode == "redirect":
        configureTrafficRedirection(productionNetworkID, shadowNetworkID)

    scheduleNetworkDeletion(shadowNetworkID, duration)
    return shadowNetworkID
```

**Potential Benefits:** Real-time threat analysis, proactive vulnerability detection, improved incident response, reduced risk to production services.
