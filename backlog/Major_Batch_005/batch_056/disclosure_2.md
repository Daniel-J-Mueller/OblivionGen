## Dynamic Interference Cancellation via Predictive Beamforming

**Concept:** Extend the overlay transmission concept by actively predicting and cancelling interference *before* it occurs, rather than relying solely on decoding separation. This leverages machine learning to anticipate UT transmission patterns and preemptively null interference in the receiver beamforming weights.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing communication system infrastructure (satellite/ground station).
    *   High-resolution Angle of Arrival (AoA) / Angle of Departure (AoD) estimation hardware at the base station/satellite.
    *   Dedicated processing unit (FPGA/GPU) for real-time beamforming weight calculations.
    *   UTs equipped with minimal reporting capability (e.g., a simple signal strength indicator).
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **UT Behavior Profiler:** A machine learning model (Recurrent Neural Network preferred) trained on historical transmission data (time, frequency, power, location) from each UT. This model predicts future transmission patterns for each UT.
    *   **Interference Prediction Module:** Based on the UT Behavior Profiler outputs, this module predicts the interference signature (amplitude, phase, frequency) each UT will generate at the receiver.
    *   **Predictive Beamforming Engine:**
        1.  Receive signal from all UTs.
        2.  Run UT Behavior Profiler to predict transmission patterns for each UT.
        3.  Predict interference signature for each UT.
        4.  Calculate beamforming weights that *null* the predicted interference signals. This is done *before* signal decoding.
        5.  Apply beamforming weights to the received signal.
        6.  Decode the desired signal.
    *   **Feedback Loop:** Monitor decoded signal quality and adjust the UT Behavior Profiler and Predictive Beamforming Engine parameters to improve performance.
*   **Data Requirements:**
    *   Historical transmission data from each UT (at least several weeks of data).
    *   Real-time signal strength reports from each UT.
    *   Periodic channel state information (CSI) reports from each UT (optional, but beneficial).

**Pseudocode (Predictive Beamforming Engine):**

```
function PredictiveBeamforming(receivedSignal, UT_List, HistoricalData):
  // UT_List: List of active User Terminals
  // HistoricalData: Database of historical transmission data

  beamformingWeights = InitializeWeights()

  for each UT in UT_List:
    predictedTransmission = PredictTransmission(UT, HistoricalData)  // Using ML model
    interferenceSignature = CalculateInterferenceSignature(predictedTransmission)

    // Calculate weights to null the predicted interference
    nullingWeights = CalculateNullingWeights(interferenceSignature)

    beamformingWeights += nullingWeights

  // Apply beamforming weights to the received signal
  beamformedSignal = ApplyBeamforming(receivedSignal, beamformingWeights)

  return beamformedSignal
```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   **Cooperative Interference Cancellation:** Allow UTs to share information about their predicted transmissions to improve interference cancellation performance.
*   **Dynamic Resource Allocation:**  Dynamically allocate resources to UTs based on their predicted interference levels.
*   **Integration with NOMA:** Combine predictive beamforming with NOMA to further increase spectral efficiency.
