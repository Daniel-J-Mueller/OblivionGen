## Adaptive Query Shaping via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Extend the execution time prediction system to *actively shape* queries before execution, optimizing them for a selected query engine *based on predicted performance*, rather than passively selecting an engine based on a static query plan.

**Specification:**

**1. Components:**

*   **Query Plan Analyzer:** Takes the initial query and generates a set of potential query plan variations. These variations could include different join orders, index selections, filtering strategies, and data partitioning schemes.
*   **Reinforcement Learning Agent (RLA):** This is the core of the system. It observes the query, the potential query plan variations, and the predicted execution times (from existing models – leverages the original patent’s prediction capability). The RLA then *selects* a query plan variation to be executed.
*   **Execution Time Predictor:** As in the original patent, but now used by the RLA to *evaluate* the potential query plan variations *before* execution.
*   **Query Engine Interface:**  Facilitates the execution of the selected query plan by the chosen query engine.
*   **Reward Function:** Defines the criteria for success.  A simple reward could be 1/execution_time. More complex rewards could incorporate resource utilization, cost, and query complexity.
*   **State Representation:** The 'state' observed by the RLA includes:
    *   Query features (e.g., number of tables, joins, filters)
    *   Predicted execution times for each query plan variation on each query engine.
    *   Current system load (CPU, memory, I/O).
    *   Historical performance data for similar queries.
*   **Action Space:** The RLA's 'actions' are the selection of a specific query plan variation to execute.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Query Reception:** A query is received.
2.  **Plan Generation:** The Query Plan Analyzer generates a set of N possible query plan variations.
3.  **Prediction:** The Execution Time Predictor estimates the execution time of each plan variation on each available query engine.
4.  **RLA Action Selection:** The RLA, based on the current state (query features, predicted times, system load, history), selects a specific query plan variation and query engine combination.
5.  **Execution:** The selected plan is executed on the chosen engine.
6.  **Reward Calculation:**  The reward function calculates a reward based on the actual execution time, resource usage, and other relevant metrics.
7.  **RLA Training:** The RLA updates its policy based on the reward received, learning to select better plans for future queries.

**3. Pseudocode (RLA Update):**

```
// Q-Learning Update Rule (example - can use other RL algorithms)
Q(state, action) = Q(state, action) + learning_rate * (reward + discount_factor * max_a' Q(next_state, a') - Q(state, action))

// Where:
// Q(state, action) is the estimated value of taking action in state
// learning_rate is a parameter controlling how much the estimate is updated
// reward is the reward received after taking the action
// discount_factor is a parameter controlling the importance of future rewards
// max_a' Q(next_state, a') is the maximum estimated value of any action in the next state
```

**4. Considerations:**

*   **Exploration vs. Exploitation:**  The RLA needs to balance exploring new plans with exploiting known good plans.  Techniques like epsilon-greedy or UCB can be used.
*   **State Space Dimensionality:**  The state space can be very large.  Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction techniques may be necessary.
*   **Training Data:**  A significant amount of training data is needed for the RLA to learn effectively.  Synthetic data generation may be helpful.
*   **Dynamic Environment:** System load and data distributions can change over time.  The RLA needs to be able to adapt to these changes.  Continuous learning or periodic retraining may be necessary.
