## Dynamic Hierarchy Prediction & Pre-Computation

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical data system by introducing predictive pre-computation based on anticipated user access patterns *before* a second entity's hierarchy is fully formed. This leverages the access patterns of the first entity to proactively build 'skeleton' hierarchies for potential second entities, drastically reducing latency when a new entity is identified.

**Specifications:**

**1. Access Pattern Profiler:**

*   **Input:** Stream of data access requests for the first entity’s hierarchy.
*   **Process:**  Tracks frequency of access for each data point within the first hierarchy.  Employ a decaying average to prioritize recent access patterns over historical ones. Identifies 'access paths' – common sequences of data point accesses.
*   **Output:**  Weighted access path graph. Nodes represent data points. Edges represent transitions between data points with associated weight (frequency of transition).  Stores top-N most frequent access paths.

**2. Predictive Hierarchy Builder:**

*   **Input:** Weighted access path graph, incoming data stream for potential second entities, class of entities definition.
*   **Process:** 
    *   Upon identifying a potential second entity, the system *immediately* initiates a ‘skeleton’ hierarchy.
    *   For each identified access path in the top-N, create corresponding nodes in the skeleton hierarchy for the second entity.  These nodes contain only minimal data (e.g., identifiers, placeholders).
    *   The structure of the skeleton hierarchy mirrors the access path, leveraging the first entity's hierarchy as a template.
    *   Priority queue for 'real' data computation:  Nodes in the skeleton hierarchy are added to a priority queue. The priority is determined by the frequency of the corresponding access path (higher frequency = higher priority).
*   **Output:** Partially constructed hierarchy (skeleton) with a priority queue of nodes awaiting data computation.

**3. Data Ingestion & Completion:**

*   **Input:** Incoming data stream for the second entity, partially constructed hierarchy (skeleton), priority queue.
*   **Process:**
    *   As data arrives for the second entity, prioritize computation of data points based on the priority queue.
    *   Fill in the placeholders within the skeleton hierarchy with actual data.
    *   Dynamically adjust priorities within the queue as new data arrives and access patterns emerge for the second entity.
*   **Output:** Fully constructed hierarchy for the second entity.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Access Pattern Profiler
function update_access_pattern(data_point_id) {
  access_counts[data_point_id]++;
  access_history.add(data_point_id); // Track sequence
  // Calculate decaying average for weighting
  update_access_path_graph(access_history)
}

// Predictive Hierarchy Builder
function create_skeleton_hierarchy(new_entity) {
  skeleton = new Hierarchy()
  for each access_path in top_N_access_paths {
    create_path_nodes(skeleton, access_path)
    add_to_priority_queue(skeleton, access_path)
  }
  return skeleton
}

//Data Ingestion & Completion
function process_new_data(new_entity_data, skeleton) {
  for each data_point in new_entity_data {
    find_corresponding_node(skeleton, data_point)
    populate_node(node, data_point)
  }
  recalculate_priority_queue(skeleton)
}
```

**Key Improvements:**

*   **Reduced Latency:** By proactively building a skeleton hierarchy, computation begins *before* the entire dataset is available.
*   **Adaptive Prioritization:**  Dynamically adjusts priorities based on evolving access patterns.
*   **Optimized Resource Allocation:** Focuses computational resources on the most frequently accessed data points.
