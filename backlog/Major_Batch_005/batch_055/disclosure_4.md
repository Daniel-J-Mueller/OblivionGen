## Adaptive Privilege ‘Shadowing’ for Predictive Security

**Specification:** A system designed to proactively adjust client device privileges based on observed behavioral ‘shadows’ – patterns of application usage, network access, and resource consumption – anticipating potential security risks *before* they manifest. This goes beyond simply reacting to privilege requests, aiming for predictive security posture adjustment.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Profiler (BP):** Runs on the central server. Constantly analyzes anonymized telemetry data from client devices – application launch sequences, network connection patterns, CPU/memory usage, file access (metadata only, no content). BP uses machine learning (anomaly detection, time-series analysis) to create ‘behavioral shadows’ for each device.  Shadows are stored as probabilistic models.
2.  **Risk Assessment Engine (RAE):**  Also on the server.  Takes the behavioral shadow as input, along with threat intelligence feeds (known malware signatures, vulnerability databases, emerging attack patterns). RAE calculates a ‘risk score’ – a dynamic assessment of the device’s likelihood of being compromised or involved in malicious activity.
3.  **Privilege Adjustment Module (PAM):** Server-side. Receives the risk score from RAE.  PAM maintains a tiered privilege matrix – levels of access associated with risk score ranges.  Based on the score, PAM generates a ‘delta manifest’ – a set of privilege additions/removals.
4.  **Client-Side Agent (CSA):**  Resides on each device.  Communicates with the server. Receives delta manifests from PAM.  Applies the changes to the device’s privilege state.  Also collects telemetry data for BP.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Baseline Creation:** CSA collects initial telemetry. BP creates a baseline behavioral shadow for the device.
2.  **Continuous Monitoring:** CSA continuously sends anonymized telemetry to BP.
3.  **Shadow Update:** BP updates the behavioral shadow in real-time.
4.  **Risk Scoring:** RAE calculates the risk score based on the updated shadow and threat intelligence.
5.  **Delta Manifest Generation:** PAM generates a delta manifest containing privilege adjustments.
6.  **Privilege Application:** CSA applies the changes to the device, potentially requiring user notification (depending on the scope of changes and configured policy).
7.  **Adaptive Adjustment:** The system continuously loops, adapting privilege levels based on evolving behavior and threat landscape.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side - PAM):**

```
function generateDeltaManifest(riskScore, currentPrivileges):
  // Define privilege tiers (example)
  tier1 = {risk: 0-3, privileges: {basic_apps, web_browsing}}
  tier2 = {risk: 4-7, privileges: {basic_apps, web_browsing, email}}
  tier3 = {risk: 8-10, privileges: {basic_apps, web_browsing, email, limited_networking}}

  if riskScore >= 8:
    desiredPrivileges = tier3.privileges
  else if riskScore >= 4:
    desiredPrivileges = tier2.privileges
  else:
    desiredPrivileges = tier1.privileges

  delta = calculateDifference(currentPrivileges, desiredPrivileges)
  return delta
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Proactive, not Reactive:** Moves beyond responding to privilege requests.
*   **Behavioral Modeling:**  Privileges based on *how* a device is used, not just *what* it's trying to do.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Continually adapts to changing risk profiles.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Leverages ML to identify unusual activity.
