## Dynamic Challenge Weighting & Behavioral Biometrics Fusion

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Module:** Behavioral Authentication Engine (BAE)
*   **Input Sources:**
    *   User Account Identification
    *   Real-time Device Sensor Data (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, touch pressure, scrolling speed, gyroscope data – if available)
    *   Authentication Challenge Response Data (from existing or new challenges – voice, face, knowledge-based questions)
*   **Output:** Confidence Score, Risk Level, Authentication Decision (Allow/Deny/Challenge)
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Standard server infrastructure. Processing load scales with user base. Integration with existing authentication services.

**Innovation Detail:**

The system shifts from static authentication point values to *dynamic weighting* based on real-time behavioral biometrics *during* the challenge response process.

1.  **Baseline Behavioral Profile:** Upon initial account creation/enrollment, a baseline behavioral profile is established for each user. This includes passive data collection (sensor data while user is simply using the system) and active data collection (during initial authentication setup). This profile is stored securely.
2.  **Real-time Behavioral Analysis:** During an authentication attempt, the BAE continuously analyzes incoming sensor data *as the user responds to challenges*.
3.  **Dynamic Weighting Algorithm:**
    *   The algorithm calculates a 'Behavioral Consistency Score' (BCS) – how closely the user's current behavior matches their baseline profile.
    *   The BCS is used to *dynamically adjust* the authentication point values of each challenge.
        *   High BCS: Challenges are weighted *higher*.  Indicates strong confidence in user identity.
        *   Low BCS: Challenges are weighted *lower*. Indicates potential compromise or impersonation, requiring stricter scrutiny.
4.  **Challenge Selection & Presentation:**
    *   The system can *adaptively select* challenges based on the current risk level and BCS.  For example, if the BCS is low, it might present more difficult or multi-factor challenges.
5.  **Confidence Score Calculation:**
    *   The overall confidence score is a weighted sum of:
        *   Authentication point values of correct responses (weighted by BCS)
        *   A 'Behavioral Confidence Component' derived from the BCS itself.
6.  **Inverse Confidence Component (Refinement):** Introduce an 'Anomaly Score' based on deviations from the baseline behavioral profile.  This anomaly score is *subtracted* from the confidence score, adding a further layer of security.
7. **Multi-Modal Fusion**: Allow blending of any biometric data or sensor data into the behavioral profile. E.g. blending accelerometer data, combined with keyboard stroke data to create a more robust profile.

**Pseudocode (Core Algorithm):**

```
function calculateConfidenceScore(userAccount, challengeResponses, sensorData):
  baselineProfile = loadBaselineProfile(userAccount)
  bcs = calculateBehavioralConsistencyScore(sensorData, baselineProfile)
  anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(sensorData, baselineProfile)

  confidenceScore = 0
  for each response in challengeResponses:
    if response.isCorrect:
      pointValue = response.challenge.pointValue * bcs // Dynamic weighting
      confidenceScore += pointValue
  
  confidenceScore -= anomalyScore //Subtract anomalies

  return confidenceScore
```

**Possible Enhancements:**

*   **Federated Learning:** Allow behavioral profiles to be updated collaboratively across multiple devices *without* sharing raw sensor data.
*   **Adversarial Training:** Train the BAE to be resistant to behavioral mimicry attacks.
*   **Explainable AI:** Provide users with insights into why their authentication was successful or unsuccessful.
