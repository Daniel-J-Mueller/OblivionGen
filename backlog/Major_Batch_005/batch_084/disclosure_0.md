## Adaptive Pipeline Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of the data processing pipeline modules based on data characteristics and computational resources. The existing patent focuses on caching outputs of *fixed* modules. This expands on that by allowing modules to *split* or *merge* based on real-time analysis.

**Specification:**

*   **Module Decomposition/Aggregation Engine:** A core component responsible for analyzing incoming data and resource availability (CPU, GPU, memory). It determines if a module should be split into smaller, parallelizable sub-modules or merged with adjacent modules for efficiency.
*   **Data Characteristic Analysis:** Each module includes a lightweight analysis component to profile incoming data (e.g., size, complexity, distribution). This data is fed to the Module Decomposition/Aggregation Engine.
*   **Resource Monitoring:**  A system component continuously monitors available computational resources.
*   **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** The system can dynamically reconfigure the pipeline *without* interrupting ongoing processing (using techniques like live migration of sub-modules).
*   **Granularity Levels:**  Modules can operate at varying levels of granularity (e.g., a complex image processing module might split into separate modules for color correction, edge detection, and sharpening).
*   **Metadata Tagging:**  Data objects are tagged with metadata indicating the pipeline configuration used to generate them. This ensures reproducibility and allows for efficient cache invalidation when the pipeline changes.

**Pseudocode (Module Decomposition/Aggregation Engine):**

```
function decompose_or_aggregate(module, data_characteristics, resource_availability):
  if resource_availability < threshold_low and data_characteristics.complexity > threshold_high:
    #Split module into sub-modules
    sub_modules = split(module)
    return sub_modules
  elif resource_availability > threshold_high and module.complexity > threshold_medium:
    #Merge module with adjacent modules
    merged_module = merge(module, adjacent_modules)
    return merged_module
  else:
    return module
```

**Cache Integration:**

*   The existing caching mechanism is extended to support different granularities.  Cache keys include the pipeline configuration (module decomposition/aggregation state) along with the standard data identifiers.
*   Cache invalidation becomes more complex, as changes to the pipeline configuration may invalidate cached results.  A dependency graph is maintained to track cache dependencies.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved resource utilization.
*   Increased pipeline throughput.
*   Adaptability to varying data characteristics.
*   Reduced latency.
