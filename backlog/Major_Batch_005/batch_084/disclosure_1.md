**Dynamic Substrate Address Resolution & Automated Remediation**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the existing system to dynamically resolve substrate addresses (the "extension of the provider network") *before* compute instance launch, and implement automated remediation if those addresses become unreachable or change. This moves beyond static configuration and reactive monitoring.

**II. Components:**

*   **Substrate Discovery Service (SDS):** A new service responsible for proactively discovering and validating substrate addresses. This leverages techniques like DNS probing, ICMP pings, and potentially more sophisticated Layer 7 health checks (HTTP/HTTPS probing) specific to the substrate device’s exposed services. SDS runs *constantly*, not just on initial setup.
*   **Address State Database (ASDB):** A persistent store holding the current, validated state of each substrate address. This includes reachability status, last known good timestamp, and associated metadata (device type, owner, location).
*   **Predictive Failure Analysis (PFA) Module:**  Integrated within SDS. PFA analyzes historical reachability data for each substrate address. It looks for patterns suggesting impending failure (e.g., increasing latency, intermittent outages).
*   **Automated Remediation Engine (ARE):** Triggered by PFA or direct address failure detection.  ARE initiates pre-defined remediation actions. These actions could include:
    *   **Address Failover:** Switching to a secondary/backup substrate address (if configured).
    *   **Compute Instance Re-routing:** Modifying routing tables to direct traffic away from the failed address.
    *   **Self-Healing Workflow:** Triggering a workflow on the substrate device itself (e.g., restarting a service, running a diagnostic script) via API.
    *   **Alert Escalation:** If remediation fails or is not possible.

**III. Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Discovery:**  When a new extension of the provider network is registered, SDS scans for associated substrate addresses.
2.  **Continuous Monitoring:** SDS continuously monitors the reachability of each substrate address, updating the ASDB with status changes.
3.  **Predictive Analysis:** PFA analyzes historical data to identify potential failures.
4.  **Automated Remediation:**  Upon detection of failure (either proactively by PFA or reactively), ARE initiates the appropriate remediation action.
5.  **Compute Instance Integration:** The existing compute instance launch process queries the ASDB for the *current*, validated substrate address.  This ensures that instances are configured with the correct endpoint.

**IV. Pseudocode (Example - Remediation Action - Failover):**

```pseudocode
function handle_address_failure(substrate_address):
  # Check if a backup address is configured
  backup_address = get_backup_address(substrate_address)
  if backup_address != null:
    # Update ASDB with new address
    update_asdb(substrate_address, backup_address, "Backup Active")
    # Reconfigure compute instances (using existing APIs)
    reconfigure_compute_instances(substrate_address, backup_address)
    # Log event
    log_event("Failover to backup address: " + backup_address)
  else:
    # No backup available – escalate alert
    escalate_alert("No backup address configured for: " + substrate_address)

function reconfigure_compute_instances(failed_address, new_address):
  for each instance in instances_using_address(failed_address):
    update_instance_config(instance, failed_address, new_address)
    restart_instance_service(instance, "routing") #Or relevant service
```

**V.  Enhancements:**

*   **Geographic Awareness:**  Prioritize failover to backup addresses in the same geographic region to minimize latency.
*   **Load Balancing Integration:** Integrate with existing load balancing solutions to distribute traffic across multiple substrate addresses.
*   **Machine Learning:** Use machine learning to predict substrate failures with greater accuracy and optimize remediation actions.
