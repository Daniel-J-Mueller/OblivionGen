## Dynamic Product Space Mapping & Personalized Interaction Prediction

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing spatial-temporal feature detection to create a dynamically updating 3D map of the product space *and* simultaneously predict potential shopper interactions based on learned behavioral patterns *before* actions occur. This goes beyond simply *detecting* an event to *anticipating* it.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Multi-Camera Calibration & Fusion:** Employ a network of calibrated cameras (minimum 3, ideally 4+) to capture overlapping views of the product space. Implement a real-time SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm to create a dense 3D point cloud of the space.

2.  **Semantic Segmentation & Object Instantiation:**  Utilize a deep learning model (e.g., Mask R-CNN variant) to perform semantic segmentation of the point cloud, identifying not just “product space” but *individual products* and their exact 3D boundaries. This creates instanced 3D product objects.

3.  **Actor Pose Estimation & Tracking:** Integrate a multi-person pose estimation model (e.g., OpenPose, Detectron2) to track the 3D pose of actors within the camera views. Fuse pose data with the SLAM-generated map to create a consistent 3D representation of actors moving within the space.

4.  **Behavioral Pattern Database:**  Construct a database storing sequences of actor poses, product interactions, and resulting events (e.g., item picked up, item returned, item examined).  This database is populated through continuous observation and labeling.  Use a recurrent neural network (RNN) or Transformer architecture to model temporal dependencies in the behavioral data.

5.  **Predictive Interaction Engine:**
    *   Input: Current actor pose, 3D map of product space, historical behavioral data.
    *   Processing:
        *   Feature Extraction: Extract spatial features (distance to products, angles relative to products) and temporal features (velocity, acceleration, past interactions) from the current actor pose and 3D map.
        *   Prediction: Feed extracted features into the trained RNN/Transformer model to predict the probability of different interaction events (picking up a specific item, returning an item, simply looking at an item).  Output a ranked list of potential interactions.
    *   Output:  A probabilistic prediction of the actor’s next action.

6.  **Augmented Reality Overlay (Optional):** Display predicted interactions as an AR overlay on a heads-up display or digital signage, providing shoppers with helpful information or personalized recommendations.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Interaction Engine):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION predict_interaction(actor_pose, product_map, behavior_database):
  // Extract spatial features
  spatial_features = calculate_spatial_features(actor_pose, product_map)

  // Extract temporal features
  temporal_features = calculate_temporal_features(actor_pose, historical_interactions)

  // Concatenate features
  combined_features = concatenate(spatial_features, temporal_features)

  // Feed into trained model
  prediction = trained_model.predict(combined_features)

  // Rank predictions
  ranked_predictions = sort_predictions(prediction)

  RETURN ranked_predictions
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems primarily *react* to shopper actions. This design anticipates actions, providing opportunities for proactive assistance and personalized experiences. The dynamic 3D map and behavioral prediction engine create a more intelligent and responsive retail environment. This moves from reactive analysis to proactive anticipation.
