## Adaptive Model Partitioning with Dynamic Encryption Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the secure/unsecure model partitioning concept to a *dynamic* system where the granularity of encryption changes based on real-time edge device capabilities, network conditions, and data sensitivity. This isn't just about layer-wise division, but fine-grained partitioning of *individual weights* or even *activation functions* within a neural network.

**Specs:**

*   **System Components:**
    *   **Central Model Repository (CMR):** Stores the complete, unencrypted data processing model.
    *   **Partitioning & Encryption Engine (PEE):**  Resides within the provider network and is responsible for generating and encrypting model partitions.
    *   **Edge Device Capability Profiler (EDCP):** Collects and maintains profiles of each edge device, including compute power, memory, energy constraints, and secure element availability.  This data is updated continuously.
    *   **Network Condition Monitor (NCM):**  Tracks network bandwidth, latency, and packet loss between the hub and edge devices.
    *   **Data Sensitivity Analyzer (DSA):**  Analyzes incoming data streams to determine the sensitivity level (e.g., low, medium, high) and dynamically adjust encryption levels.
*   **Partitioning Strategy:**
    *   **Granularity:**  Weights *and* activation functions can be partitioned.
    *   **Dynamic Allocation:**  Partitioning is *not* static.  The PEE recalculates the optimal partitioning based on EDCP, NCM, and DSA data.
    *   **Cost Function:** The PEE uses a cost function to optimize partitioning, considering:
        *   Compute load on edge devices.
        *   Encrypted data transmission overhead.
        *   Security risk (based on data sensitivity).
        *   Energy consumption.
*   **Encryption Protocol:**
    *   **Homomorphic Encryption (HE):**  Employ HE to allow edge devices to perform computations on encrypted data without decryption.  This minimizes data exposure.
    *   **Key Management:** Utilize a distributed key management system (e.g., using blockchain) to ensure secure key exchange and revocation.
    *   **Dynamic Key Rotation:**  Rotate encryption keys frequently to mitigate the impact of potential key compromises.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  The CMR stores the full model.
    2.  The EDCP, NCM, and DSA gather real-time data.
    3.  The PEE uses this data and the cost function to determine the optimal partitioning.
    4.  The PEE generates encrypted model partitions for the secure portion.
    5.  The PEE transmits encrypted partitions to the hub.
    6.  The hub distributes the appropriate partitions to edge devices.
    7.  Edge devices perform computations on their assigned partitions (encrypted or unencrypted).
    8.  Encrypted results are sent to the hub for further processing.

**Pseudocode (PEE - Partitioning Logic):**

```
function generate_partitions(model, edcp_data, ncm_data, dsa_data):
  partitions = {}
  for layer in model.layers:
    for weight in layer.weights:
      sensitivity = dsa_data.get_sensitivity(data_stream) #Get data sensitivity
      edge_capability = edcp_data.get_capability(edge_device)
      network_bandwidth = ncm_data.get_bandwidth()

      if sensitivity == "high" and edge_capability > threshold and network_bandwidth > threshold:
        partitions[weight] = encrypt(weight, HE_key)
      else:
        partitions[weight] = weight #Keep weights unencrypted

  return partitions
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond static layer-wise partitioning to a granular, adaptive system. By factoring in edge device capabilities, network conditions, and data sensitivity, the system dynamically optimizes for security, performance, and resource utilization. This makes the system more robust, scalable, and secure in diverse IoT environments.
