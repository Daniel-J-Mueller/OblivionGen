## Adaptive Component Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of UI component loading and execution based on user device capabilities, network conditions, and perceived user intent. Instead of a binary "defer loading" approach, offer a spectrum of loading strategies.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Modules:**

*   **Device Capability Profiler:**  Collects and maintains a profile of the user’s device (CPU, RAM, GPU, network bandwidth, screen resolution).  This runs on initial page load and updates periodically or when device characteristics change (e.g., network switch).
*   **Intent Predictor:**  Analyzes user behavior (mouse movements, scroll speed, interaction patterns) to predict likely future interactions. Leverages simple heuristics and potentially lightweight ML models.
*   **Granularity Manager:**  The central decision-making module.  Receives input from the Device Capability Profiler and Intent Predictor.  Defines a “granularity level” for each UI component. Granularity levels range from:
    *   *Fully Loaded*: All component code is loaded and executed immediately.
    *   *Core Loaded, Extensions Deferred*:  Only the essential functionality is loaded initially.  Extended features are deferred.
    *   *Skeleton Loaded*: Minimal code for rendering a placeholder UI element. Functionality is loaded only when interacted with.
    *   *Offloaded*: Component is not loaded until explicitly requested or a specific condition is met.
*   **Resource Manager:** Handles the actual loading and unloading of component code based on the Granularity Manager’s instructions.  Implements caching and prioritization strategies.

**II.  Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Page Load:**
    *   Device Capability Profiler runs and establishes a baseline device profile.
    *   The Intent Predictor begins monitoring user behavior.
    *   The Granularity Manager, based on the initial profile and initial behavior data, assigns a starting granularity level to each UI component.  Higher-level components (e.g., navigation) receive higher granularity than lower-level, less critical components.
2.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   **Device Change Detection:** The Device Capability Profiler continuously monitors for changes in device characteristics. Significant changes trigger a re-evaluation of granularity levels.
    *   **Intent Prediction:** The Intent Predictor refines its understanding of user intent. For example:
        *   If the user is rapidly scrolling through a list, components for items further down the list are loaded with lower granularity.
        *   If the user pauses over a specific component for an extended period, that component is loaded with higher granularity.
    *   **Granularity Adjustment:** The Granularity Manager adjusts granularity levels based on changes in device capabilities and predicted intent.
    *   **Resource Management:** The Resource Manager loads or unloads component code as directed by the Granularity Manager.

**III. Pseudocode (Granularity Manager):**

```
function adjustGranularity(component, deviceProfile, predictedIntent) {
  baseGranularity = getBaseGranularity(component) // Configurable default

  // Modify based on device
  if (deviceProfile.cpuSpeed < minimumCpuSpeed) {
    granularityLevel = "Skeleton Loaded"
  } else if (deviceProfile.networkBandwidth < minimumBandwidth) {
    granularityLevel = "Core Loaded, Extensions Deferred"
  } else {
    granularityLevel = baseGranularity
  }

  // Modify based on intent
  if (predictedIntent.isScrollingRapidly) {
    granularityLevel = min(granularityLevel, "Core Loaded, Extensions Deferred") //Reduce
  } else if (predictedIntent.isFocusingOnComponent(component)) {
    granularityLevel = max(granularityLevel, "Fully Loaded") //Increase
  }

  // Apply the level
  resourceManager.setGranularity(component, granularityLevel)
}

loop {
    for each component in UI {
        adjustGranularity(component, deviceProfile, predictedIntent)
    }
    sleep(50ms) //Adjust update rate as needed
}
```

**IV.  Considerations:**

*   **Configuration:** The "baseGranularity" and threshold values (minimumCpuSpeed, minimumBandwidth) must be configurable to allow for optimization for specific use cases.
*   **Caching:** Aggressive caching is crucial to minimize the impact of dynamic loading and unloading.
*   **User Experience:** Transitions between granularity levels should be smooth and seamless to avoid jarring the user.
*   **Component Design:** Components should be designed to support varying levels of functionality.  A "core" version of each component should always be available.
