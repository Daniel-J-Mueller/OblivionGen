## Adaptive Content Mirroring & Projection System

**System Overview:** A portable device and associated display system enabling dynamic content mirroring *and* projection onto arbitrary surfaces, adapting to ambient lighting and surface texture for optimal visibility. This expands on the remote control aspect of the original patent by *creating* the display surface, rather than simply controlling content *on* an existing one.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Portable Device (The “Anchor”):**
    *   High-resolution miniature projector (laser-based for brightness and color accuracy).
    *   Wide-angle, high-speed camera.
    *   LiDAR or structured light sensor for 3D surface mapping.
    *   Ambient light sensor.
    *   Processing unit (dedicated image processing and geometry warping capabilities).
    *   Wireless communication (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi 6E).
    *   Button/Voice Control (integrated with existing patent functionality for content selection).
    *   Haptic feedback system.

2.  **Display System (Software/Firmware):**
    *   **Real-time Surface Reconstruction:** Camera & LiDAR data combined to create a dynamic 3D model of the target surface.
    *   **Adaptive Geometry Warping:** Projection is warped to correct for surface imperfections, angles, and curvature. This creates a 'flat' appearing display on any surface.
    *   **Ambient Light Compensation:** System analyzes ambient light and adjusts projection brightness and color temperature accordingly. Includes dynamic contrast adjustment.
    *   **Content Mirroring/Streaming:** Receives content from the portable device or streams directly from the internet.
    *   **Multi-Anchor Synchronization:** Enables multiple Anchors to work together, creating larger, seamless displays across multiple surfaces.
    *   **Interactive Projection Mapping:** Allows users to interact with projected content using hand gestures or the portable device as a pointer.

**Pseudocode (Surface Mapping & Warping):**

```
// Surface Mapping Loop
while (true) {
    // Capture depth data from LiDAR
    depthData = captureLiDARData();

    // Capture visual data from camera
    imageData = captureCameraData();

    // Fuse depth and visual data to create a point cloud
    pointCloud = fuseData(depthData, imageData);

    // Generate a mesh from the point cloud
    mesh = generateMesh(pointCloud);

    // Calculate the texture coordinates for the mesh
    textureCoordinates = calculateTextureCoordinates(mesh);

    // Apply geometry warping to the projection matrix
    projectionMatrix = warpGeometry(projectionMatrix, mesh, textureCoordinates);
}

// Projection Loop
while (true) {
    // Get content to display
    content = getContent();

    // Render content to a texture
    texture = renderContent(content);

    // Apply projection matrix
    projectedTexture = applyProjectionMatrix(texture, projectionMatrix);

    // Output projected texture to projector
    outputToProjector(projectedTexture);
}
```

**Operational Modes:**

*   **Mirror Mode:**  Mirrors the display of a connected device (smartphone, tablet, laptop).
*   **Streaming Mode:** Streams content directly from the internet.
*   **Interactive Mode:**  Allows users to interact with projected content.
*   **Ambient Mode:** Displays ambient visuals (artwork, weather, time) when not actively used.
*   **Multi-Anchor Mode:** Synchronizes multiple Anchors to create larger displays.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Mobile gaming and entertainment.
*   Portable presentations and meetings.
*   Augmented reality experiences.
*   Dynamic signage and advertising.
*   Immersive learning environments.
*   Emergency communication (projecting maps or instructions onto walls).

**Materials:** Lightweight, durable polymer casing for the Anchor. High-transmission projection lens. Miniature high-efficiency laser projection module.
