## Adaptive Transaction Sharding with Predictive Lock Acquisition

**Concept:** Extend the transaction buffer concept to dynamically adjust sharding based on transaction workload *and* predictively acquire locks *before* conflict, minimizing aborts and maximizing throughput. This moves beyond reactive conflict resolution to proactive prevention.

**Specification:**

**I. Components:**

*   **Transaction Coordinator (TC):**  Existing functionality, manages transactions.
*   **Sharding Predictor (SP):** A machine learning model analyzing transaction patterns (data stream access, event types, user behavior) to predict potential shard contention. Runs asynchronously.
*   **Dynamic Shard Manager (DSM):**  Responsible for splitting, merging, or replicating shards based on SP predictions.  Can operate hot-swap to minimize disruption.
*   **Preemptive Lock Manager (PLM):**  Based on SP’s predictions, attempts to acquire locks *before* events are written to the transaction buffer. This requires a ‘tentative lock’ mechanism.
*   **Tentative Lock:** A lightweight lock indicating intent to acquire a full lock. Multiple tentative locks are allowed. Full lock acquisition will fail if another transaction already holds a full lock.

**II. Workflow:**

1.  **Transaction Initiation:** Client requests a transaction. TC generates a transaction ID.
2.  **Workload Prediction:** TC sends transaction characteristics (data streams, event types) to SP.
3.  **Shard Adjustment (Asynchronous):** SP analyzes the workload and suggests shard adjustments to DSM. DSM dynamically adjusts sharding as needed.  This runs in the background.
4.  **Preemptive Lock Acquisition:** Before writing events to the transaction buffer, PLM uses SP’s predictions to attempt to acquire tentative locks on affected shards.
5.  **Event Writing & Lock Transition:** Events are written to the transaction buffer. PLM attempts to upgrade tentative locks to full locks. If successful, the transaction proceeds.
6.  **Conflict Handling:** If full lock acquisition fails, PLM initiates a standard OCC rollback procedure.
7.  **Lock Release:** Upon commit or abort, all locks (tentative or full) are released.
8.  **Continuous Learning:** SP continuously learns from transaction patterns, refining its shard predictions and lock acquisition strategies.

**III. Pseudocode (PLM - Lock Acquisition)**

```pseudocode
function acquireLocks(transactionID, events):
  tentativeLocks = []
  fullLocksAcquired = false

  // Acquire tentative locks
  for event in events:
    shardID = getShardID(event.stream, event.data)
    tentativeLock = attemptTentativeLock(shardID)
    if tentativeLock is successful:
      tentativeLocks.append(shardID)
    else:
      //Handle tentative lock failure.  Potentially adjust shard strategy
      //or signal a possible rollback
      log("Tentative lock failed for shard: " + shardID)
      return false //Indicate that the transaction cannot proceed

  // Attempt to upgrade to full locks
  for shardID in tentativeLocks:
    fullLock = attemptFullLock(shardID)
    if fullLock is successful:
      //Track successful full locks
      continue
    else:
      //Rollback - Release all tentative locks, and signal failure
      releaseTentativeLocks(tentativeLocks)
      return false //Indicate that the transaction cannot proceed

  //All locks acquired successfully
  return true //Indicate that the transaction can proceed
```

**IV. Data Structures:**

*   **Shard Metadata:** Shard ID, Data Stream, Replication Factor, Current Load, Predicted Load.
*   **Lock Table:** Shard ID, Lock Type (Tentative/Full), Owner Transaction ID.

**V. Considerations:**

*   **Tentative Lock Overhead:** Minimize the overhead of tentative locks to avoid performance degradation.
*   **SP Training Data:**  The effectiveness of the SP depends on the quality and quantity of training data.
*   **Dynamic Sharding Complexity:**  Dynamic sharding can be complex and require careful design to minimize disruption.
*   **Potential for Thundering Herd:** Careful design required to prevent multiple transactions from attempting to acquire the same locks simultaneously.
