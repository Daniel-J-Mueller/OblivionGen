## Decentralized Account Data Vault with Biometric & Geo-Fencing

**Concept:** A secure, portable account data vault residing on a user’s device (smartphone, tablet) utilizing biometric authentication *and* geo-fencing to control access, independent of operating system or network site logins. This goes beyond simply removing data on logout; it creates a truly isolated and actively protected data store.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A dedicated application, “SecureVault,” running as a foreground service (or equivalent) on the user’s device. This ensures consistent operation even under resource constraints.
*   **Data Storage:** Account data (credentials, security questions, etc.) is encrypted using a user-defined master key *and* stored within a dedicated, sandboxed storage area on the device. Encryption algorithm: AES-256 with a randomly generated initialization vector.
*   **Authentication Layers:**
    *   **Primary:** Biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition). This is the first line of defense.
    *   **Secondary:** Geo-fencing. The user defines permitted geographic zones (e.g., home, office). Access to decrypted account data is *only* granted when the device is within one of these zones. Attempts outside these zones trigger an immediate data wipe of the decrypted session and logging of the event.
*   **Network Interaction:** SecureVault does *not* directly interact with network sites. Instead, it acts as a secure credential provider for other apps (browser, dedicated apps) via a custom API.  Apps request credentials from SecureVault, which handles authentication (biometric check, geo-location check) and *then* provides the necessary credentials *only* if authorized.
*   **API Specification:**
    *   `SecureVault.requestCredentials(appID, networkSiteURL)` – Returns encrypted credentials if authorized; otherwise, returns an error code.
    *   `SecureVault.addAccount(networkSiteURL, username, encryptedPassword)` – Adds a new account to the vault.
    *   `SecureVault.removeAccount(networkSiteURL)` – Removes an account.
    *   `SecureVault.getMasterKeyHash()` - Returns a hash of the master key (for verification purposes, not decryption).
*   **User Interface:** Minimalist UI focused on account management (adding, editing, deleting). Emphasis on security settings (geo-fencing configuration, master key change).
*   **Data Wipe Protocol:** A scheduled data wipe function, triggered if the device remains inactive for a predefined period *and* is outside all configured geo-fences.
*   **Pseudocode - Credential Request Flow:**

```
FUNCTION requestCredentials(appID, networkSiteURL)
  IF biometricAuthenticationSuccessful() AND geoFenceCheckSuccessful() THEN
    DECRYPT accountDataUsingMasterKey()
    RETURN decryptedCredentials
  ELSE
    LOG authenticationFailure()
    RETURN error_code_authenticationFailed
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION geoFenceCheckSuccessful()
  GET currentDeviceLocation()
  FOR EACH geoFence IN userDefinedGeoFences
    IF isLocationWithinGeoFence(currentDeviceLocation, geoFence) THEN
      RETURN TRUE
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR
  RETURN FALSE
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Innovation & Differentiation:**  This system shifts the responsibility for account security from individual network sites to the user's device, providing a layer of protection independent of network vulnerabilities. The combination of biometric authentication *and* geo-fencing creates a dynamic security perimeter, adapting to the user's location and activity.  It’s not merely removing data on logout; it's actively controlling access and preventing unauthorized use.
