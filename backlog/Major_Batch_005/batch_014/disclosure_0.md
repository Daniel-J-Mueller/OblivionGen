## Adaptive Experimentation with Dynamic Cohort Splitting

**Concept:** Extend the early termination logic to *dynamically* split experiment cohorts based on interim results, allowing for more granular and potentially faster insights. Instead of a single termination decision for the entire experiment, the system creates sub-cohorts optimized for different outcomes.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Dynamic Cohort Manager (DCM)
*   **Input:**
    *   Real-time data stream from ongoing experiment (same data used for probability calculations in the base patent).
    *   Predefined segmentation criteria (e.g., demographics, behavioral patterns, device type).
    *   Outcome metrics (KPIs) – the things the experiment is trying to influence.
    *   Cost/Benefit Matrix – weighting of different outcomes (some outcomes more valuable than others).
*   **Process:**

    1.  **Interim Analysis:** At defined intervals (or triggered by significant data shifts), the DCM performs interim analysis on incoming data, calculating probability values for each defined segment (as in the original patent).
    2.  **Segment Evaluation:** The DCM evaluates each segment based on its interim performance against defined KPIs. Segments are classified as:
        *   **High Potential:**  Strong positive trends, likely to yield significant results.
        *   **Neutral:**  Trends are inconclusive, require more data.
        *   **Low Potential:**  Negative trends, unlikely to yield significant results.
    3.  **Cohort Splitting:**
        *   **High Potential:**  These segments are expanded – more traffic is directed to them.
        *   **Neutral:** Traffic allocation remains consistent.
        *   **Low Potential:** These segments are *split* - a portion of the traffic is diverted to a 'control' group (receiving a baseline experience) to isolate the impact of the experiment, while the rest are directed to the original experiment.
    4.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Termination thresholds for each sub-cohort are adjusted dynamically based on segment size and statistical power. Smaller segments require more stringent thresholds.
    5.  **Control Group Analysis:** The control group within the ‘low potential’ segments acts as a baseline for comparison, enabling more accurate assessment of the experiment's true impact.
    6.  **Reporting:**  A dashboard displays performance metrics for each sub-cohort, allowing analysts to identify segments that are driving (or hindering) results.

*   **Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
function analyze_cohorts(data, segmentation_criteria, outcome_metrics, cost_benefit_matrix):
    cohorts = split_data_by_segmentation(data, segmentation_criteria)
    for cohort in cohorts:
        probability_value = calculate_probability(cohort, outcome_metrics)
        if probability_value > threshold:
            # High potential - increase traffic allocation
            allocate_more_traffic(cohort)
        elif probability_value < low_threshold:
            # Low potential - split cohort
            split_cohort_into_experiment_and_control(cohort)
            analyze_control_group(cohort.control_group)
        else:
            # Neutral - maintain traffic allocation
            maintain_traffic_allocation(cohort)
```

*   **Hardware/Software Requirements:**
    *   Scalable data processing pipeline (e.g., Spark, Flink).
    *   Real-time analytics engine.
    *   Machine learning models for segment identification and probability calculation.
    *   User interface for dashboard visualization and control.
    *   Integration with existing experimentation platform.
