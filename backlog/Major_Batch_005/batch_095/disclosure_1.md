## Proximity-Based Dynamic Access Control for IoT Devices

**Concept:** Extend the proximity-based provisioning concept to create a dynamic access control system for IoT devices, leveraging short-range radio communication for temporary, granular permission granting. Imagine a smart home where your phone doesn't just *provision* a new smart bulb, but *temporarily grants it access* to certain network resources or data streams.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Roles:**
    *   **Controller:** User’s primary device (smartphone, tablet, wearable) with associated account/identity.
    *   **Target:** IoT device seeking access to resources (e.g., smart lock, camera, thermostat).
    *   **Authority:** Cloud-based service managing access policies and device identities.

*   **Communication Protocol:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) with a custom GATT profile for access requests and grants.  Also supports Thread/Matter for mesh network deployments.

*   **Access Tokens:**  Short-lived, digitally signed “proximity tokens” generated by the Controller.  Tokens encapsulate:
    *   Target Device Identifier.
    *   Requested Resource/Function (e.g., "read temperature," "unlock door," "access camera feed").
    *   Duration of Access (e.g., 5 minutes, until user leaves proximity).
    *   Granularity Level (e.g., “view only,” “read/write”).
    *   Cryptographic Signature (using Controller’s private key, verified by Authority/Target).

*   **Workflow:**

    1.  **Request:** Target device detects Controller proximity (RSSI threshold).  If access is required, Target initiates a request for a specific resource/function via BLE advertisement packet including Target ID.
    2.  **Token Generation:** Controller receives request, prompts user for confirmation (if necessary – can be automated based on pre-defined policies). Upon confirmation, Controller generates a proximity token, signs it with its private key.
    3.  **Token Transfer:** Proximity token is transmitted to Target via BLE.
    4.  **Verification:** Target validates the token signature using the Authority's public key (obtained during initial device setup).
    5.  **Access Granted:** If the token is valid, Target grants the requested access for the specified duration.
    6.  **Automatic Revocation:** Access automatically expires after the token’s duration or when the Controller moves out of proximity (determined by RSSI monitoring).

*   **Authority Role:**
    *   Device Registration/Identity Management.
    *   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for token signing/verification.
    *   Policy Enforcement (e.g., preventing access to sensitive resources based on user roles or location).
    *   Auditing/Logging of access events.

*   **Pseudocode (Controller - Token Generation):**

```
function generateProximityToken(targetDeviceId, requestedResource, duration):
    // Retrieve user's private key from secure storage
    privateKey = getPrivateKey()
    
    // Create token data
    tokenData = {
        targetDeviceId: targetDeviceId,
        requestedResource: requestedResource,
        duration: duration,
        timestamp: getCurrentTimestamp()
    }
    
    // Sign token data with private key
    signedToken = signData(tokenData, privateKey)
    
    return signedToken
```

*   **Security Considerations:**

    *   Secure key storage on Controller and Authority.
    *   Resistance to replay attacks (using timestamps and nonces).
    *   Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks (using secure BLE pairing).
    *   Regular key rotation.
    *   Device attestation to verify device integrity.

*   **Possible Extensions:**
    *   Integration with existing identity providers (e.g., OAuth 2.0).
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication.
    *   Location-based access control (e.g., granting access only when the user is inside a specific room).
    *   Dynamic policy updates via the Authority.
