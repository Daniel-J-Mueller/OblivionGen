## Dynamic Focal Point Prediction & Adaptive Resolution Scaling

**Concept:** Extend the focal region determination beyond user input or simple object detection. Utilize predictive algorithms, informed by eye-tracking data (simulated or real-time), to *anticipate* where a user will look next within the video frame, and dynamically adjust the resolution scaling to prioritize that predicted focal point *before* the user actually looks there. This allows for a smoother, more responsive viewing experience, and potentially reduces bandwidth requirements by preemptively allocating resources.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:**
    *   First video data (high-resolution source)
    *   User Input (Initial focal point – optional, serves as seed)
    *   Eye-tracking data stream (simulated or real-time – position and velocity). If no direct feed, a stochastic model based on common viewing patterns will be employed.
    *   Scene Analysis Data (Object detection, depth estimation, motion vectors).

*   **Processing Modules:**
    *   **Predictive Gaze Engine:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on large datasets of eye movements. Takes current gaze position, velocity, scene analysis data, and video content as input. Outputs a probability distribution of likely future gaze positions over a short time horizon (e.g., 100-200ms).
    *   **Resolution Map Generator:** Creates a 2D map defining resolution scaling factors for different regions of the video frame. The scaling factors are weighted based on:
        *   Predicted gaze probability (higher probability = higher resolution).
        *   Object importance (identified by scene analysis).
        *   Motion activity (areas with high motion blur benefit from higher resolution).
        *   User preference (adjustable parameters for sharpness, contrast).
    *   **Adaptive Scaling Engine:** Applies the resolution map to the source video data. This is achieved through a combination of:
        *   **Super-resolution algorithms:** Enhance the quality of low-resolution regions.
        *   **Foveated rendering:** Simulate the human visual system by rendering high-resolution detail only within the foveal region (predicted gaze point).
        *   **Content-aware scaling:** Adjust scaling factors based on the type of content (e.g., text requires higher resolution than blurred backgrounds).

*   **Output:**
    *   Second video data (adaptively scaled based on predicted gaze and scene content).
    *   Resolution Map (for debugging and visualization).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Load Predictive Gaze Model
Initialize Resolution Map

// Main Loop
For Each Frame:
    Analyze Scene (Object Detection, Motion Vectors)
    Predict Gaze Position (using Predictive Gaze Model, Scene Analysis, Previous Gaze)
    Generate Resolution Map (weighted by Predicted Gaze, Object Importance, Motion Activity)
    Apply Resolution Map to Source Video Data (using Super-resolution, Foveated Rendering)
    Output Adaptively Scaled Video Data
```

**Novelty:**  This differs significantly from existing approaches by *predicting* where the user will look, rather than simply reacting to their current gaze.  It blends predictive analytics with adaptive rendering techniques to create a more fluid and immersive viewing experience. The weighted resolution map allows for nuanced control over visual fidelity, optimizing bandwidth usage and rendering performance.
