**Dynamic Content Segmentation & Personalized Encryption**

**Concept:** Extend the existing encryption scheme to operate not on the *entire* digital content item, but on dynamically generated segments. Furthermore, personalize the encryption key delivery *per segment*, based on real-time user behavior and device characteristics.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Content Segmentation Module:**
    *   Input: Digital content item (video, audio, game asset, etc.).
    *   Process: Divide the content into granular segments (e.g., 2-5 second video clips, audio chunks, small game map tiles). Segment size is configurable.
    *   Output: A sequence of content segments.
2.  **User Behavior Analyzer:**
    *   Input: Real-time user data (viewing history, device type, network conditions, location, time of day, concurrent applications, biometric data – *with user consent*).
    *   Process: Analyze data to determine user context and predict engagement levels. Assign a ‘risk score’ based on potential for unauthorized access or redistribution.
    *   Output:  User context profile and risk score.
3.  **Key Generation & Delivery System:**
    *   Input: Content segment, user context profile, risk score.
    *   Process:
        *   Generate a unique encryption key for *each* content segment, derived from a master key and the user context/risk score. Employ a deterministic key derivation function (KDF) to ensure consistency.
        *   Encapsulate the segment and the encryption key within a secure container.
        *   Deliver the container to the customer device using a secure communication channel (e.g., TLS).  The key delivery *timing* is adjusted based on the user’s bandwidth and buffer levels, prioritizing seamless playback.
    *   Output: Secure container with encrypted segment and delivery instructions.
4.  **Client-Side Decryption Module:**
    *   Input: Secure container.
    *   Process:
        *   Authenticate the container and verify the integrity of the encrypted segment.
        *   Decrypt the segment using the received key.
        *   Buffer and render the segment.
5.  **Dynamic Key Rotation:**
    *   Implement a key rotation schedule.  Periodically (e.g., every 30-60 seconds), generate new master keys and re-encrypt subsequent content segments. This limits the damage from a potential key compromise.

**Pseudocode (Key Generation):**

```
function generateSegmentKey(segment, userContext, masterKey) {
  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(userContext);
  seed = hash(masterKey + riskScore + segment.timestamp);
  key = KDF(seed, segment.id); // Key Derivation Function
  return key;
}

function calculateRiskScore(userContext) {
  score = 0;
  if (userContext.deviceType == "unrooted") { score += 10; }
  if (userContext.network == "secure") { score += 20; }
  if (userContext.location == "trusted") { score += 30; }
  // Add more factors and weights as needed
  return score;
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:**  Smaller encryption keys and dynamic rotation minimize the impact of a compromised key.
*   **Personalized Experience:**  Risk-based encryption allows tailoring security levels to individual users.
*   **Improved Resilience:**  Segment-level encryption enables graceful degradation in case of network errors.
*   **Content Protection:**  Discourages unauthorized redistribution by making it difficult to reconstruct the entire content item.
