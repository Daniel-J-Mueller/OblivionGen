## Dynamic Relevance-Weighted Multi-Modal Search

**Concept:** Extend the existing relevance feedback loop to incorporate multiple data modalities beyond just search query/result clicks. Leverage user device sensor data (motion, audio, location) and potentially external APIs (weather, calendar) to refine relevance scoring *in real-time* during a search session.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Sensor Data:** Continuously sample data from user device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, GPS).  Data is processed locally to extract features â€“ e.g., activity type (walking, running, stationary), ambient sound level, location context (home, work, outdoors).
*   **API Integration:** Access external APIs (with user permission) to obtain contextual information. Examples:
    *   Weather API: Current conditions (temperature, precipitation).
    *   Calendar API: Upcoming appointments/events.
*   **Data Transmission:** Transmit processed sensor features and API data (minimal bandwidth usage) to the server alongside search queries and relevance feedback.

**2. Multi-Modal Relevance Scoring Engine:**

*   **Feature Vector Creation:** Combine search query terms, clicked/ignored result features, *and* sensor/API features into a high-dimensional feature vector.
*   **Dynamic Weighting:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., neural network, gradient boosted trees) to dynamically weight the different feature components based on the current search session context.  The model is trained on historical user data to learn the relationships between sensor/API features and relevance.
*   **Relevance Score Calculation:** Compute a relevance score for each search result based on the weighted feature vector.
*   **Real-Time Adjustment:** Continuously update the relevance scores *during* the search session based on incoming sensor data and user interactions.

**3. Adaptive Search Indexing:**

*   **Contextual Indexing:** Augment the existing search index with contextual metadata derived from sensor/API features.  For example, index search results based on the typical user activity associated with that result.
*   **Personalized Ranking:** Leverage the contextual index and personalized relevance scores to rank search results dynamically, delivering a highly relevant and tailored search experience.

**Pseudocode (Relevance Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateRelevanceScore(query, result, sensorData, apiData):
  queryFeatures = extractFeatures(query)
  resultFeatures = extractFeatures(result)
  sensorFeatures = extractFeatures(sensorData)
  apiFeatures = extractFeatures(apiData)

  combinedFeatures = concatenate(queryFeatures, resultFeatures, sensorFeatures, apiFeatures)

  weights = dynamicWeightingModel(combinedFeatures) // ML model outputting weights for each feature component

  relevanceScore = dotProduct(weights, combinedFeatures)

  return relevanceScore
```

**Example Scenario:**

User searches for "running shoes" while actively running outdoors (detected by accelerometer/GPS). The system prioritizes running shoe results with features like "trail running," "weatherproof," and "high cushioning" based on the real-time sensor data, even if those features weren't explicitly mentioned in the query.
