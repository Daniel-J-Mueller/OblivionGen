## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Integration

**Concept:** Integrate dynamic haptic feedback with touch target adjustments to provide users with tactile confirmation and guidance during interactions, especially for adjusted targets.

**Specifications:**

**1. Haptic Engine Profile Creation:**

*   **Input:** User interaction data (zoom level, selection attempts, device type) – sourced directly from the existing touch target optimization system.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Analyze interaction data to determine the magnitude of touch target adjustment. (e.g., a 20% increase in target size corresponds to a 'medium' haptic intensity).
    *   Map adjustment magnitude to specific haptic patterns (intensity, duration, frequency). Use distinct patterns for successful vs. failed selection attempts.
    *   Create a device-specific haptic profile based on hardware capabilities (different devices support varying haptic ranges).
*   **Output:** A haptic profile containing mapped adjustment magnitudes and associated haptic patterns, tailored for each device type.

**2. Real-time Haptic Feedback Implementation:**

*   **Trigger:** Touch target adjustment event.
*   **Action:**
    *   Upon adjustment, initiate a brief, localized haptic pulse centered on the adjusted touch target.
    *   Pulse intensity and duration correlate to the degree of adjustment (larger adjustment = stronger/longer pulse).
    *   If the user successfully selects the target *after* adjustment, provide a confirmatory haptic 'click' or vibration.
    *   If the user fails to select the adjusted target, offer a subtle 'nudge' vibration to guide them slightly.
*   **Hardware Integration:** Requires access to the device’s haptic engine. This can be achieved through platform APIs (Android, iOS).

**3. Predictive Haptic Cueing**

*   **Analysis:** Continuously monitor user zoom and pan behavior.
*   **Prediction:** If a user zooms in on an area containing a known problematic touch target, *preemptively* deliver a very subtle, localized vibration to that area *before* they attempt to select it.
*   **Goal:** Subtly draw the user’s attention to the target, potentially improving selection accuracy without requiring adjustment.

**4. System Architecture Integration:**

*   The haptic engine is integrated into the existing touch target modification system.
*   A new module handles haptic profile creation, management, and delivery.
*   The browser component (or equivalent) is modified to receive haptic instructions from the touch target modification system and relay them to the device's haptic engine.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Profile Creation):**

```
FUNCTION CreateHapticProfile(interactionData, deviceType)
  adjustmentMagnitude = CalculateAdjustmentMagnitude(interactionData)

  IF deviceType == "Smartphone_A"
    IF adjustmentMagnitude < 10%
      hapticIntensity = "Low"
      hapticPattern = "ShortPulse"
    ELSE IF adjustmentMagnitude < 20%
      hapticIntensity = "Medium"
      hapticPattern = "MediumPulse"
    ELSE
      hapticIntensity = "High"
      hapticPattern = "LongPulse"
  ELSE IF deviceType == "Tablet_B"
    //Different intensity/pattern mapping for Tablet_B
  ELSE
    //Default mapping

  RETURN { intensity: hapticIntensity, pattern: hapticPattern }
END FUNCTION
