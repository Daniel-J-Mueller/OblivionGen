## Dynamic Resource Morphing

**Concept:** Extend the recorded task concept to include *dynamic modification* of the virtual machines themselves *during* task execution, based on runtime conditions. The system doesn't just *perform* actions on VMs, it *changes* their configuration – adding/removing resources, altering operating system settings, even swapping in entirely new VM images – all as part of the recorded workflow.

**Specs:**

*   **Morph Actions:** Introduce a new action type within the recorded task system – "Morph Action". These define modifications to VMs.  Morph Actions contain:
    *   `VM Identifier`:  Specifies the target VM.
    *   `Morph Type`:  Categorizes the change (e.g., "CPU Add", "Memory Resize", "Disk Attach", "OS Swap", "Network Configuration").
    *   `Morph Parameters`:  Specific data for the Morph Type (e.g., CPU cores to add, memory size in GB, disk image path, network interface details).
    *   `Conditionals`:  Boolean logic based on runtime data (e.g., CPU utilization > 80%, specific application running, network latency exceeds threshold).  If the conditional is true, the morph action is executed.
*   **Runtime Monitoring Module:** A continuously running module that gathers data from the VMs (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, application state).  This feeds into the Conditional evaluation.
*   **Resource Pool Abstraction:** A layer that manages available resources (CPU, memory, disk space, VM images). This ensures requested morphs are possible and handles allocation/deallocation.
*   **Workflow Engine Extension:** The workflow engine needs to be able to interpret Morph Actions and trigger the Resource Pool Abstraction.  It needs to pause execution if a morph action requires time, and resume when it completes.
*   **Image Repository Integration:**  Seamless access to a repository of pre-built VM images.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:**  Critical.  If a Morph Action fails or causes instability, the system must be able to automatically revert the VM to its previous state. Snapshotting VMs before morphing is essential.

**Pseudocode (Workflow Engine handling Morph Action):**

```
function ExecuteTask(task) {
  for each action in task.actions {
    if (action.type == "MorphAction") {
      // 1. Evaluate Conditionals
      if (EvaluateConditionals(action.conditionals)) {
        // 2. Snapshot VM (rollback point)
        CreateSnapshot(action.VMIdentifier)

        // 3. Request Resource Allocation (if needed)
        RequestResources(action.MorphParameters)

        // 4. Execute Morph
        ExecuteMorph(action.VMIdentifier, action.MorphType, action.MorphParameters)

        // 5. If Morph Fails:
        if (MorphFailed()) {
          RollbackToSnapshot(action.VMIdentifier)
          Log("Morph Failed - Rolled Back")
        }
      }
    } else {
      // Execute other action types
      ExecuteStandardAction(action)
    }
  }
}
```

**Example Use Case:**

A task monitors application performance. If CPU utilization exceeds 80%, a Morph Action adds 2 CPU cores to the VM. If memory usage exceeds 90%, the task swaps in a VM image with more RAM. This allows the system to *automatically* scale resources based on application demands, all within the recorded workflow. The user simply *defines* the scaling rules, and the system handles the rest.
