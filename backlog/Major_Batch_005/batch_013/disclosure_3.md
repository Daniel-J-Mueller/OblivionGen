## Dynamic Preference Shifting via Predictive Path Instability

**Specification:** Implement a system that *predicts* path instability *before* reaching the threshold count of active paths outlined in the provided patent. Instead of *reacting* to a drop below the threshold, the system anticipates this drop and proactively shifts path preference.

**Components:**

*   **Path Stability Monitor (PSM):** A module collecting metrics on each active path:
    *   **Packet Loss Rate:** Tracked over a rolling window.
    *   **Latency Jitter:** Measured deviation in round-trip time.
    *   **Announcements Received (ARR):** Count of recent announcements from the next-hop peer indicating path availability. Critically, *decreases* in ARR are weighted more heavily.
    *   **Resource Utilization (RU):** Bandwidth usage on the link.
*   **Instability Prediction Engine (IPE):** A machine learning model trained to predict path failure based on PSM data. Input features are the metrics described above. Output is a 'Path Stability Score' (PSS), ranging from 0 (highly unstable) to 1 (highly stable).
*   **Preference Adjustment Module (PAM):** Adjusts the attribute associated with the routing prefix *before* the threshold count is reached, based on the PSS.

**Operation:**

1.  The PSM continuously monitors metrics on each active path.
2.  The IPE calculates a PSS for each path based on PSM data.
3.  The PAM implements a tiered preference adjustment:
    *   **PSS > 0.8:** No adjustment. Path is stable.
    *   **0.5 < PSS <= 0.8:** Slight preference reduction. Reduce weight by 5%.
    *   **0.2 < PSS <= 0.5:** Moderate preference reduction. Reduce weight by 15%.
    *   **PSS <= 0.2:** Significant preference reduction. Reduce weight by 30%. Initiate probing of alternate paths.
4.  The preference adjustments are reflected in the attribute associated with the routing prefix and are announced to peers.
5.  When the number of active paths *does* drop below the threshold, the system has already proactively de-prioritized unstable paths, minimizing disruption.

**Pseudocode (Preference Adjustment Module):**

```
function adjust_preference(path_pss, current_weight):
  if path_pss > 0.8:
    return current_weight
  elif 0.5 < path_pss <= 0.8:
    return current_weight * 0.95  // 5% reduction
  elif 0.2 < path_pss <= 0.5:
    return current_weight * 0.85  // 15% reduction
  else:
    return current_weight * 0.70  // 30% reduction
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Adaptive Learning:** The IPE should be continuously retrained with new data to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Path Probing:** When a significant preference reduction is applied, initiate probing of alternate paths to ensure availability.
*   **Correlation:** Incorporate correlation between path stability and network-wide events (e.g., DDoS attacks, link failures).
