## Dynamic Tag Prioritization & Predictive Loss System

**Concept:** Expand the LPWAN tracking beyond simple "removed from premises" alerts by implementing a dynamic tag prioritization system based on user-defined value/importance *and* predictive loss modeling. This moves from reactive tracking to proactive loss prevention.

**Specs:**

**1. Tag Data Augmentation:**

*   **Value/Priority Field:** Each tag will have a user-configurable “Value” or “Priority” field (1-10, or similar scale). This is set during tag association with an object.  Higher values indicate more critical objects.
*   **Motion Vector Logging:** Tags will transmit not only location data but also short-term motion vectors (direction/speed changes). This builds a behavioral profile for the tracked object.
*   **Environmental Data (Optional):** Tags will optionally include basic environmental sensors (temperature, humidity).  Changes can indicate potential damage/theft conditions.

**2. Smart-Home Hub Modifications:**

*   **Behavioral Baseline:** The hub will establish a behavioral baseline for each tag by analyzing motion vectors over time.  Deviation from this baseline triggers increased monitoring.
*   **Predictive Loss Algorithm:**
    *   **Input:** Tag Value/Priority, Deviation from Behavioral Baseline, Environmental Data, Time of Day, Day of Week, Historical Loss Data (if available, i.e., past instances of object removal).
    *   **Output:**  A “Loss Risk Score” (0-100).  Higher scores indicate a greater probability of loss or damage.
*   **Dynamic Monitoring Adjustment:**
    *   Loss Risk Score < 20: Standard monitoring frequency.
    *   20 <= Loss Risk Score < 60: Increased monitoring frequency.  Hub requests more frequent tag data transmissions.
    *   Loss Risk Score >= 60:  Highest monitoring frequency.  Initiate proactive alerts (see below).  Activate nearby A/V devices for pre-emptive surveillance.
*   **Proactive Alert System:**
    *   If Loss Risk Score exceeds a threshold (user-configurable), *before* the object leaves the premises, send a “Potential Loss Warning” to the user, suggesting verification of the object's location.
    *   Enable "watch" mode on nearby A/V devices, initiating continuous recording focused on the object's last known location.

**3. A/V Device Integration:**

*   **"Watch Mode":** Upon receiving a "Watch Mode" command from the hub, A/V devices will:
    *   Activate pan/tilt/zoom to focus on the specified location.
    *   Initiate continuous recording (with buffering).
    *   Implement basic object detection to confirm the object is still present.
*   **Real-Time Video Feed:** The hub can request a real-time video feed from nearby A/V devices to visually verify the object's status.

**4. Backend Server Modifications:**

*   **Historical Data Storage:** Store tag data, Loss Risk Scores, and A/V recording metadata for trend analysis and algorithm refinement.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Utilize machine learning to improve the accuracy of the Predictive Loss Algorithm over time.

**Pseudocode (Smart-Home Hub - Loss Risk Calculation):**

```
function calculateLossRisk(tagData, historicalData):
  value = tagData.value  // User-defined value (1-10)
  deviation = calculateDeviationFromBaseline(tagData.motionVectors)
  environmentalImpact = assessEnvironmentalRisk(tagData.environmentalData)
  timeOfDayFactor = getTimeOfDayRiskFactor() // Higher risk at night
  historicalRisk = getHistoricalLossRisk(tagData.tagID)

  riskScore = (value * 0.3) + (deviation * 0.2) + (environmentalImpact * 0.1) + (timeOfDayFactor * 0.1) + (historicalRisk * 0.3)

  return clamp(riskScore, 0, 100)
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond simple "lost object" alerts to *predict* potential loss, allowing for proactive intervention *before* an object is actually lost or stolen.  Combines user-defined value, behavioral analysis, and environmental data to create a dynamic risk assessment system.
