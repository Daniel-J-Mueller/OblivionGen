## Dynamic View Composition with Predictive Prefetching & User Behavior Modeling

**Concept:** Enhance data aggregation and view generation by incorporating predictive prefetching based on user behavior modeling, and allow for dynamic view composition *after* initial data retrieval. This moves beyond static template-driven views toward truly personalized and responsive data experiences.

**Specifications:**

**1. User Behavior Profiler Module:**

*   **Data Input:** User interaction logs (clicks, scrolls, time spent on elements, search queries, past view preferences, device type, location – anonymized where appropriate).
*   **Processing:** Employ machine learning (specifically, recurrent neural networks or transformer models) to build user profiles predicting likely data requests/view preferences.  Profiles are continuously updated.  Emphasis on sequence prediction – what is the user *likely* to request *next* given their current interaction?
*   **Output:**  A probability distribution of likely data modules/elements for each user (or user segment). This is stored as a “Prefetch Profile”.

**2. Predictive Prefetch Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Prefetch Profile (from User Behavior Profiler), Current Request (identifiers),  Template Definition.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Analyze the current request and template.
    *   Compare against the Prefetch Profile to identify modules/data elements *not* explicitly requested but likely of interest.
    *   Initiate asynchronous prefetching of these modules/data.
    *   Prefetched data is stored in a dedicated "Prefetch Cache" alongside the main data cache.
*   **Output:**  Prefetched data modules stored in the Prefetch Cache.

**3. Dynamic View Composer:**

*   **Input:**  Template Definition, Retrieved Data Modules (from main cache), Prefetched Data Modules (from Prefetch Cache), User Interaction Events (real-time).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Initial view rendering based on the template and retrieved data.
    *   *Real-time* view adaptation based on user interaction.
    *   If the user interacts with an area where pre-fetched data is available, seamlessly incorporate it into the view *without* a further request.
    *   If the user’s interaction indicates a need for data *not* pre-fetched, initiate a request (but prioritize data from the Prefetch Cache if available).
    *   Template adjustments:  Allow for dynamic template component selection and ordering based on user interaction and the availability of pre-fetched data. 
*   **Output:**  Dynamically adjusted view of data, streamed to the client.

**4. Cache Management & Expiration Policies:**

*   **Hierarchical Cache:**  Main data cache (for frequently accessed data) + Prefetch Cache (for predicted data).
*   **Expiration:**  Employ a combination of Time-to-Live (TTL) and Least Recently Used (LRU) policies for both caches.  Prefetch Cache expiration should be shorter than the Main Cache, as predictions are less reliable over longer periods. 
*   **Cache Invalidation:**  Implement a mechanism to invalidate prefetched data when underlying data sources change.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic View Composer):**

```
function composeView(template, retrievedData, prefetchedData, userInteraction):
  initialView = renderInitialView(template, retrievedData)
  
  while (userInteraction is active):
    interactionEvent = getUserInteractionEvent()
    
    if (interactionEvent relates to prefetch area):
      incorporatePrefetchedData(interactionEvent, prefetchedData)
      updateView(interactionEvent)
    else:
      requestNewData(interactionEvent)
      newData = receiveNewData()
      incorporateNewData(newData)
      updateView(interactionEvent)
```

**Innovation Focus:** Moves beyond static view creation and simple caching toward a proactive, personalized data experience.  Reduces latency by anticipating user needs and delivering data *before* it's explicitly requested. The adaptive template component selection further enhances personalization and responsiveness.
