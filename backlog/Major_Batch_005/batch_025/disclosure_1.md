## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted User Behavior & Cognitive Load

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply throttling requests to proactively *shape* the user experience by dynamically adjusting resource allocation based on predicted cognitive load. The premise is to move beyond simply managing *volume* of requests to managing the *complexity* of the information delivered.

**Specs:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Cognitive Load Prediction Module (CLPM):**  Analyzes user interaction patterns (dwell time, scrolling speed, click patterns, input complexity – e.g., long-form vs. short-form input, number of selections) to estimate real-time cognitive load.  This is *not* about measuring effort, but about predicting when a user is approaching a point of cognitive overload.  Utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a dataset of user interaction data correlated with known measures of cognitive load (e.g., pupil dilation, EEG data – initial training data, then adapted to passive observation).

*   **Resource Complexity Assessment Module (RCAM):**  Analyzes the complexity of resources (web pages, data sets, application features) to assign a 'cognitive complexity score'.  Factors considered: information density, number of interactive elements, visual complexity, reading level, data volume.  Uses a combination of static analysis (e.g., analyzing HTML/CSS/JavaScript) and dynamic analysis (rendering the resource and measuring rendering time, DOM size, number of API calls).

*   **Dynamic Allocation Engine (DAE):**  The core logic for adjusting resource allocation. Receives input from CLPM & RCAM. Prioritizes resource delivery based on a weighted algorithm (described below).

**II. Algorithm – Weighted Prioritization**

The DAE uses the following formula to determine resource prioritization score:

`Priority Score = (1 - CLPM_Output) * RCAM_Output * User_Value_Factor +  Emergency_Override_Factor`

*   `CLPM_Output`:  Normalized output from the Cognitive Load Prediction Module (0 = low load, 1 = high load).
*   `RCAM_Output`: Normalized cognitive complexity score of the resource (0 = low complexity, 1 = high complexity).
*   `User_Value_Factor`:  A pre-defined weight based on user subscription tier or importance (e.g., premium users get higher priority).
*    `Emergency_Override_Factor`:  A factor which allows for quick changes in priorities (i.e. if the user is in a critical action, like a financial transaction)

**III. Implementation Details:**

*   **Data Collection:**  Client-side JavaScript to collect interaction data (with user consent). Data is anonymized and aggregated.
*   **Server-Side Processing:**  CLPM and RCAM run on the server to provide real-time analysis and decision-making.
*   **Resource Shaping Techniques:**
    *   **Progressive Rendering:** Load simpler versions of resources first, then progressively add complexity.
    *   **Content Summarization:** Automatically summarize complex content to reduce information overload.
    *   **Feature Gating:** Hide or disable less critical features to simplify the user interface.
    *   **API Throttling:**  Reduce the number of simultaneous API calls to reduce server load and improve response times.

**IV. Pseudocode - DAE Logic:**

```pseudocode
function allocateResource(user, resource) {
  userValue = getUserValue(user);
  cognitiveLoad = getCognitiveLoad(user);
  resourceComplexity = getResourceComplexity(resource);
  emergencyOverride = getEmergencyOverride(user);

  priorityScore = (1 - cognitiveLoad) * resourceComplexity * userValue + emergencyOverride;

  if (priorityScore > threshold) {
    deliverResource(resource); // Deliver resource immediately
  } else {
    queueResource(resource); // Queue for later delivery
  }
}

function deliverResource(resource) {
  // Deliver resource to user
}

function queueResource(resource) {
  // Add resource to queue for later delivery
}
```

**V. Novelty:**  

Most existing traffic management systems focus on *volume*. This system focuses on *cognitive load* – shaping the *experience* to prevent overload, rather than just preventing crashes.  It proactively adjusts resources to match the user’s current cognitive capacity.
