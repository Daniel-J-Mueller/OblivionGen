**Dynamic Proximity-Based Content Adaptation & Anticipatory Prefetching**

**Concept:** Expand upon the pre-caching concept by introducing dynamic content adaptation *based on detected proximity and predicted user intent*, proactively adjusting media quality and detail *before* a share request or explicit user action. This moves beyond simple pre-fetching to *anticipatory rendering* and delivery.

**Specifications:**

*   **Proximity Sensor Integration:** Devices equipped with UWB, Bluetooth LE AoA/AoD, or similar proximity sensing technologies.
*   **Contextual Data Aggregation:** Beyond relationship data, aggregate data points:
    *   Device Motion (acceleration, gyroscope):  Predicts user focus (e.g., looking at something, walking towards a point of interest).
    *   Ambient Audio Analysis: Detects keywords (e.g., "show that photo," "play that song") or emotional cues.
    *   Environmental Data:  Lighting conditions, detected objects (via computer vision – if available), location context.
*   **Intent Prediction Engine:** A lightweight, on-device AI model trained to predict user intent based on contextual data. Outputs a probability distribution over potential media requests.
*   **Adaptive Media Pipeline:**
    *   Multiple Renderings: Generate different versions of media content (varying resolution, compression, detail levels, AR overlays) *concurrently*.
    *   Prioritized Streaming: Stream the version most likely to be requested based on the Intent Prediction Engine.  Higher probability = higher priority/quality.
    *   On-Demand Upscaling/Downscaling: If the prediction is incorrect, dynamically adjust the streamed content to the requested quality *without* requiring a full re-render.
*   **Prefetching Strategy:**  Beyond simply pre-caching based on past interactions, proactively fetch content predicted as likely based on intent *before* any explicit request.
*   **Energy Management:** Implement aggressive power-saving modes for proximity sensing and intent prediction when not actively sharing content.
*   **Caching Protocol:**  Extend existing cache with a ‘confidence score’ indicating the reliability of the pre-fetched content.  Lower confidence = lower priority for display, and/or a prompt to verify before sharing.

**Pseudocode (Intent Prediction & Adaptive Streaming):**

```
// Device A (Sender)
function onContextDataReceived(motionData, audioData, locationData) {
    intent = predictIntent(motionData, audioData, locationData); // AI model
    bestMediaVersion = selectMediaVersion(intent);
    streamMediaVersion(bestMediaVersion);
}

function selectMediaVersion(intent) {
    // Example:
    if (intent.probability("show high-res photo") > 0.7) {
        return highResPhotoVersion;
    } else if (intent.probability("play music") > 0.6) {
        return compressedMusicVersion;
    } else {
        return defaultLowResVersion;
    }
}

// Device B (Receiver)
function onReceiveMedia(mediaVersion, confidence) {
    if (confidence > 0.8) {
        displayMedia(mediaVersion);
    } else {
        promptUser("Verify media before sharing?");
    }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Collaborative Prefetching:** Multiple nearby devices collaborate to prefetch content based on collective intent.
*   **AR Integration:** Pre-render AR overlays based on detected environment and predicted user interaction.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:** Pre-generate haptic feedback patterns based on predicted content type.
