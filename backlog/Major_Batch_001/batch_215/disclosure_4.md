## Modular Stacking Container System with Active Height Adjustment

**Concept:** Expand upon the variable-height nesting concept by creating a modular container system where individual containers can actively adjust their height *after* being stacked, independent of rotational alignment. This creates dynamic storage solutions capable of adapting to varying load heights and maximizing vertical space utilization.

**Specs:**

*   **Container Body:** Square profile with consistent upper rim height. Material: High-strength, lightweight polymer composite.
*   **Internal Actuation Mechanism:** Each container incorporates a miniature linear actuator (servo-driven ball screw) within its base. Actuator travel range: 5-15cm.
*   **Power/Communication:** Wireless charging & Bluetooth/WiFi communication for system control. Integrated battery within each container base.
*   **Support Features (Modified):** 
    *   **Lower Exterior Wedges:** Present, but with flattened, wider surfaces for stable contact.
    *   **Lower Interior Wedges:** Modified to incorporate a force sensor array.
    *   **Upper Support Features:** Replaced with a circular ‘load distribution ring’ molded into the interior upper sidewall. This ring evenly distributes weight onto the container below.
*   **Base Plate:** Robust base plate housing the actuator, battery, and control circuitry. Features magnetic feet for securing to metal shelving/surfaces.
*   **Control System:** Central control unit (or app) allows for:
    *   Individual container height adjustment.
    *   Pre-programmed stacking configurations.
    *   Automated height adjustment based on load weight (using force sensor data).
    *   Container identification & tracking.
*   **Safety Features:**
    *   Overload protection (actuator shutdown).
    *   Emergency stop functionality (all containers).
    *   Container-to-container communication to prevent unstable stacking.

**Pseudocode (Automated Height Adjustment):**

```
// Container Stack Management System

FUNCTION AdjustStackHeight(StackID, TargetHeight):
    // Get containers in StackID
    containers = GetContainersInStack(StackID)

    // Loop through containers (bottom to top)
    FOR EACH container IN containers:
        // Calculate required height adjustment
        requiredAdjustment = TargetHeight - container.currentHeight

        // Check for physical obstructions / load limits
        IF ObstructionDetected(container) OR LoadLimitExceeded(container):
            ReportError("Height adjustment blocked")
            RETURN

        // Activate linear actuator
        ActivateActuator(container, requiredAdjustment)
        container.currentHeight = TargetHeight
    END FOR
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION OptimizeStackHeight(StackID):
    containers = GetContainersInStack(StackID)

    totalLoadWeight = 0
    FOR EACH container IN containers:
        totalLoadWeight += GetContainerWeight(container)

    // Distribute load evenly by adjusting container heights
    heightOffset = totalLoadWeight / NumberOfContainers(containers)

    // Adjust height for each container
    FOR EACH container IN containers:
        AdjustStackHeight(StackID, container.defaultHeight + heightOffset)
    END FOR

END FUNCTION

// Main Loop
WHILE True:
    // Check for user input or automated events (e.g., load weight change)
    IF UserInput OR LoadWeightChange:
        IF UserInput:
            // Process user commands (e.g., adjust height, optimize stack)
        ELSE:
            // Automatically optimize stack based on load weight
            OptimizeStackHeight(CurrentStackID)
    END IF
END WHILE
```

**Refinements:**

*   Integration with automated guided vehicles (AGVs) for dynamic warehouse management.
*   Transparent container bodies for visual inventory control.
*   Implementation of a ‘smart label’ system for RFID tracking and automated container identification.
*   Adaptive stacking configurations based on container contents (e.g., fragile items placed higher).
