## Dynamic Codelet Composition for Heterogeneous Compute

**Concept:** Extend the frequency-based routing to operate on *parts* of user code – “codelets” – and dynamically compose them across fleets optimized for specific codelet characteristics. This moves beyond routing entire programs and enables finer-grained optimization and resource allocation.

**Specification:**

*   **Codelet Definition:** A user program is decomposed into functionally independent codelets. Codelets are defined by API contracts – inputs, outputs, dependencies, estimated execution time, resource requirements (CPU, memory, GPU), and a ‘complexity score’ (a metric representing the inherent computational difficulty – e.g., lines of code, cyclomatic complexity).
*   **Fleet Specialization:** Beyond low/high volume, create specialized fleets optimized for different codelet characteristics. Examples:
    *   *Fast-Path Fleet:* Optimized for low-complexity, high-frequency codelets (e.g., simple data transformations).
    *   *Heavy-Compute Fleet:* Equipped with GPUs/accelerators for complex, CPU-intensive codelets (e.g., matrix operations, machine learning inference).
    *   *Memory-Bound Fleet:* Optimized for codelets requiring large memory access (e.g., data loading, large-scale data processing).
*   **Dynamic Composition Engine:**
    *   Analyzes incoming requests and decomposes user code into codelets.
    *   Assigns each codelet a ‘profile’ based on its characteristics (complexity, resource needs, frequency).
    *   Determines the optimal fleet for *each* codelet based on real-time fleet capacity and codelet profile.
    *   Generates an execution plan – a sequence of codelet executions, each assigned to a specific fleet.
    *   Orchestrates codelet execution across fleets.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously monitors codelet performance on each fleet and adjusts fleet assignments to optimize overall performance. This involves:
    *   Collecting metrics: execution time, resource utilization, error rates.
    *   Using machine learning to predict optimal fleet assignments based on historical data.
*   **API Interface:**
    *   `decompose(program_code)`: Returns a list of codelets.
    *   `execute(codelet_list, execution_plan)`: Executes the codelets according to the plan.
    *   `monitor(codelet_id, fleet_id)`: Returns performance metrics for a specific codelet on a specific fleet.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Composition Engine):**

```
function compose_and_execute(program_code):
  codelets = decompose(program_code)
  execution_plan = {}
  for codelet in codelets:
    profile = analyze_codelet(codelet)
    best_fleet = select_best_fleet(profile)
    execution_plan[codelet] = best_fleet
  result = execute_plan(execution_plan, codelets)
  return result

function select_best_fleet(profile):
  # Query real-time fleet capacity and performance metrics
  # Apply machine learning model to predict best fleet based on profile
  return best_fleet

function execute_plan(execution_plan, codelets):
  # Iterate through codelets and send them to assigned fleets
  # Handle communication and data transfer between fleets
  # Aggregate results and return
  return result
```

**Considerations:**

*   Data serialization/deserialization overhead between fleets.
*   Complexity of codelet decomposition and dependency management.
*   Scalability of the dynamic composition engine.
*   Security considerations for inter-fleet communication.
