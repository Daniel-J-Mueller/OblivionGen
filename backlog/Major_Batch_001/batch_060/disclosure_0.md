**Dynamic Volumetric Capture & Haptic Feedback System**

**Concept:** Expand the area-of-interaction detection into a true 3D volumetric capture system, coupled with a localized haptic feedback array. Instead of simply determining *an* area, we reconstruct a dynamic 3D model of any object within the detection zone and provide tactile feedback mimicking its surface.

**Specifications:**

*   **Emitter Array:** Replace the perimeter-based emitters with a dense array of micro-LEDs or laser diodes distributed across a spherical or cuboidal volume. Density: Minimum 100 emitters/m³.  Wavelength range: Visible & Near-Infrared (for depth mapping).  Individual emitter control: PWM dimming & on/off control with >1 kHz refresh rate.
*   **Sensor Array:** Utilize a Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor array, co-located with the emitter array, to capture depth data. Resolution: 1 cm³ voxels. Update rate: >30 Hz.  Combined with photodiode arrays for light curtain data capture, providing redundancy & increased fidelity.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance embedded system with dedicated GPU for real-time 3D reconstruction & haptic data processing. Minimum specifications:  Octa-core CPU, 16GB RAM, dedicated GPU with >4GB VRAM.  Operating System: Real-time Linux distribution.
*   **Haptic Feedback Array:**  Localized array of micro-actuators (e.g., piezoelectric elements, shape memory alloys) positioned directly above/below the detection volume.  Resolution: 1 cm spacing.  Actuation range: 1-5 mm displacement. Controlled by the processing unit based on the reconstructed 3D model.
*   **Software Stack:**
    *   **3D Reconstruction Module:** Algorithms for point cloud generation from ToF & light curtain data.  Noise filtering & surface smoothing.  Mesh generation from point cloud.
    *   **Haptic Mapping Module:** Algorithms for mapping 3D surface geometry to haptic actuator displacement.  Dynamic adjustment based on object size & shape.  Force feedback control.
    *   **Communication Interface:**  API for external control & data access (e.g., ROS, TCP/IP).
*   **Calibration System:** Automated calibration procedure for aligning emitter/sensor arrays & haptic actuator array.  Utilizing known calibration objects.
*   **Power Supply:** Redundant power supplies with battery backup.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Mapping):**

```
function GenerateHapticPattern(objectMesh):
  hapticPattern = new Array()
  for each triangle in objectMesh:
    centerPoint = calculateTriangleCenter(triangle)
    closestActuator = findClosestActuator(centerPoint)
    displacement = calculateDisplacement(triangle) // Based on triangle area, normal vector, etc.
    hapticPattern.add(closestActuator, displacement)
  return hapticPattern

function calculateDisplacement(triangle):
  area = triangleArea(triangle)
  normal = triangleNormal(triangle)
  displacement = area * normal.z // Scale displacement by z-component of normal
  return displacement
```

**Operational Scenario:** A user places an object within the detection volume. The system captures its 3D geometry and generates a corresponding haptic pattern.  The user can then "feel" the shape and texture of the object through the haptic actuator array.  This can be used for applications such as remote object manipulation, virtual prototyping, and accessibility for the visually impaired.
