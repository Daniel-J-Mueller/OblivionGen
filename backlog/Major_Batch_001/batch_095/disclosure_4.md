## Dynamic Payload Composition & Contextual Delivery

**Concept:** Extend the timer-based payload delivery system with the ability to dynamically compose payloads *just before* delivery, incorporating real-time contextual data. This moves beyond simply delivering a static payload at a scheduled time to delivering a *relevant* payload based on current conditions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Contextual Data Sources:**

*   **API Integration:**  The system will expose an API allowing registration of contextual data sources. These sources could be anything: weather services, stock tickers, user activity feeds, geolocation services, internal application state (e.g., inventory levels, campaign status), and so on.
*   **Data Mapping:** Each registered data source requires a mapping configuration. This configuration defines:
    *   Data Source Identifier: Unique ID for the source.
    *   Query Parameters: Parameters to pass to the data source.
    *   Data Extraction Rules: Rules (e.g., JSONPath, XPath, regular expressions) to extract relevant data from the data source response.
    *   Data Type: Specifies the data type of the extracted information (string, integer, boolean, etc.).

**2. Payload Template Engine:**

*   **Template Language:** Employ a template language (e.g., Handlebars, Jinja2) for defining payload structures.
*   **Template Variables:**  Payload templates will include variables referencing:
    *   Original Payload Data: The initial payload submitted with the timer request.
    *   Contextual Data: Variables representing data extracted from registered contextual data sources.
*   **Template Validation:**  Templates must be validated against a schema to ensure proper structure and data types.

**3. Dynamic Composition Process:**

1.  **Timer Trigger:** When a timer expires, the system initiates the dynamic composition process.
2.  **Contextual Data Fetching:**  For each registered contextual data source associated with the timer:
    *   The system executes the configured query with defined parameters.
    *   The response is parsed using the configured extraction rules.
    *   The extracted data is stored in a context variable.
3.  **Payload Rendering:** The payload template is rendered using the original payload data and the collected context variables.  This creates the final, dynamic payload.
4.  **Delivery:**  The rendered payload is delivered to the specified destination.

**4.  Configuration Schema (JSON Example):**

```json
{
  "timerId": "uniqueTimerIdentifier",
  "payloadTemplate": "<h1>Hello {{userName}}!</h1><p>The temperature is {{temperature}}Â°C.</p>",
  "contextualDataSources": [
    {
      "dataSourceId": "weatherAPI",
      "queryParameters": {
        "city": "London",
        "units": "metric"
      },
      "dataExtractionRules": {
        "temperature": "$.main.temp"
      },
      "dataType": "number"
    },
    {
      "dataSourceId": "userProfileAPI",
      "queryParameters": {
        "userId": "12345"
      },
      "dataExtractionRules": {
        "userName": "$.name"
      },
      "dataType": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

**5.  Error Handling:**

*   **Data Source Failure:** Implement retry mechanisms for failed data source requests.  Provide fallback data or default values if a data source is unavailable.
*   **Template Rendering Errors:** Log errors during template rendering and provide mechanisms for debugging templates.
*   **Payload Validation:** Validate the rendered payload before delivery to ensure it meets the required format and constraints.



This system moves beyond scheduled notifications to truly *intelligent* delivery of relevant information.  Consider use cases like personalized marketing campaigns triggered by weather conditions, real-time inventory alerts adjusted based on demand, or dynamic pricing updates reflecting competitor actions.
