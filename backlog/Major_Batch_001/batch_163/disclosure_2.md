## Event Horizon Prediction & Adaptive Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the existing event throttling & profiling system with a predictive element. Instead of *reacting* to event volume and potential profile overload, *anticipate* it. Introduce a short-term event horizon prediction model coupled with dynamic profile adaptation.

**Specs:**

**1. Event Horizon Module:**

*   **Input:** Event stream (identical to existing system).  Raw event data is crucial, not just aggregated metrics.
*   **Prediction Model:** Time-series forecasting (LSTM or similar recurrent neural network preferred). Trained on historical event data, categorized by event type *and* associated profile.  Separate models per profile *or* a generalized model with profile-specific embeddings.
*   **Horizon:** Configurable prediction window (e.g., 5 seconds, 10 seconds).  This dictates how far into the future the system attempts to forecast event volume.
*   **Output:** Predicted event volume per profile for the prediction horizon. Also, a confidence score for the prediction.  High confidence = more reliable prediction. Low confidence = treat prediction conservatively.

**2. Dynamic Profile Adaptation:**

*   **Profile States:** Profiles move between states: *Normal*, *Preemptive*, *Overloaded*.
*   **State Transitions:** Driven by predicted event volume *and* current resource usage.
    *   **Normal:** Predicted volume below threshold & sufficient resources.
    *   **Preemptive:** Predicted volume approaching threshold *before* overload.  Initiates resource allocation (e.g., increasing metrics storage, spawning analysis engine instances).  May also proactively *throttle* less critical event types to conserve resources.
    *   **Overloaded:** Predicted volume exceeds threshold & resources are insufficient. Aggressive throttling applied.  May also temporarily disable less critical profiles altogether.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Configurable policies determine what resources are allocated to each profile in *Preemptive* state.
*   **Adaptive Throttling:** Throttling rules are *dynamic*, based on predicted volume *and* current profile state. More granular than existing throttling.  Prioritize critical event types.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Monitor actual event volume vs. predicted volume.  Adjust prediction model weights to improve accuracy.

**3. System Integration:**

*   **Event Stream Interception:** The Event Horizon Module intercepts the event stream *before* the existing throttling system.
*   **State Communication:** The Event Horizon Module communicates profile states to the existing throttling system.  Throttling rules are adjusted accordingly.
*   **Metrics Integration:** The prediction model's confidence score is exposed as a metric.  Alerting can be configured based on low confidence.
*   **Configuration:** Extensive configuration options for prediction horizon, thresholds, resource allocation policies, and alerting.

**Pseudocode (Event Horizon Module):**

```
function predict_event_volume(event_stream, profile_id, prediction_horizon):
    // Load trained LSTM model for profile_id
    model = load_model(profile_id)

    // Extract relevant features from event_stream
    features = extract_features(event_stream)

    // Predict event volume for prediction_horizon
    predicted_volume = model.predict(features, prediction_horizon)

    // Calculate confidence score (based on model uncertainty)
    confidence_score = calculate_confidence(model)

    return predicted_volume, confidence_score
```

```
function adjust_throttling(profile_state, predicted_volume):
    if profile_state == "Normal":
        // Use existing throttling rules
        throttling_rules = get_normal_rules()
    elif profile_state == "Preemptive":
        // Increase resource allocation, throttle less critical events
        throttling_rules = get_preemptive_rules()
    elif profile_state == "Overloaded":
        // Aggressive throttling, disable less critical profiles
        throttling_rules = get_overloaded_rules()
    else:
        //Error state - default to safe throttling
        throttling_rules = get_safe_rules()

    return throttling_rules
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond reactive throttling to *proactive* resource management.  The prediction model allows the system to anticipate overload conditions and take corrective action *before* they occur. This reduces latency and improves overall system stability. The dynamic profile states allow for fine-grained control over resource allocation.
