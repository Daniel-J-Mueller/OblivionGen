## Dynamic Packet Reconstruction with Predictive Header Stitching

**Concept:** Extend the programmable tunnel creation to include *reconstruction* of fragmented packets across multiple network interfaces, intelligently ‘stitching’ together headers based on predicted future fragments. This goes beyond simple reassembly, proactively building a complete packet image.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Packet Capture Modules (PCM):** Dedicated hardware modules on each network interface, capable of capturing full packet payloads (not just headers) and timestamping them with nanosecond accuracy. Each PCM includes a small, high-speed buffer (SRAM) to store captured packets temporarily.
*   **Fragment Prediction Engine (FPE):** A dedicated ASIC module incorporating a machine learning accelerator. This is the core of the predictive stitching.
*   **Header Stitching Buffer (HSB):** High-speed SRAM module dedicated to storing partially reconstructed packet headers.
*   **Packet Reconstruction Buffer (PRB):** Larger capacity DRAM buffer for storing fully reconstructed packets.

**2. Software/Firmware Components:**

*   **Fragment Prediction Model:**  A pre-trained (and continuously updated) machine learning model residing on the FPE. Input features include:
    *   Packet header fields (source/destination IP, port, protocol, flags).
    *   Inter-arrival times of fragments.
    *   Fragment offset values.
    *   Historical traffic patterns.
*   **Stitching Algorithm:** Firmware running on the FPE, implementing the following steps:
    1.  **Fragment Arrival:** PCM captures a fragment and sends it to the FPE.
    2.  **Prediction:** The FPE uses the Fragment Prediction Model to estimate:
        *   The likelihood of future fragments arriving.
        *   The expected number of future fragments.
        *   The expected offset values of future fragments.
        *   The *predicted* complete packet size.
    3.  **Header Stitching:**
        *   If the fragment is the first fragment observed: allocate space in the HSB for the reconstructed header.
        *   Append the fragment’s header fields to the allocated space in the HSB.
        *   If header fields overlap, prioritize the *most recent* values.
    4.  **Data Buffering:** The fragment's payload is buffered into the PRB at the correct offset, based on the fragment’s offset value and the current packet reconstruction state.
    5.  **Completion Check:** If the FPE predicts that all fragments have arrived (or if a timeout is reached), the reconstructed packet is considered complete.
    6.  **Validation:** Perform a checksum validation on the reconstructed packet to ensure data integrity.
    7.  **Forwarding:** Forward the reconstructed packet to its destination.

**3. Pseudocode (Stitching Algorithm):**

```
function stitchPacket(fragment):
  if (firstFragment == true):
    allocate headerSpace in HSB
    headerSpace.append(fragment.header)
    firstFragment = false
  else:
    headerSpace.append(fragment.header) // Overwrite/append as needed

  bufferFragmentData(fragment.payload, fragment.offset)

  predictedFragmentCount = predictFragmentCount(fragment)
  actualFragmentCount = countReceivedFragments()

  if (actualFragmentCount >= predictedFragmentCount):
    completePacket = reconstructPacket()
    if (checksumValid(completePacket)):
      forwardPacket(completePacket)
    else:
      dropPacket()
  else:
    // Continue buffering fragments
```

**4. Advanced Features:**

*   **Adaptive Prediction:** Continuously retrain the Fragment Prediction Model based on observed traffic patterns.
*   **Multi-Path Stitching:** Stitch together fragments arriving on *different* network interfaces.
*   **Out-of-Order Handling:**  Robustly handle fragments arriving out of order.
*   **Fragment Dropping:** Implement a mechanism for intelligently dropping fragments that are unlikely to contribute to a complete packet.



This goes beyond simple tunnel creation. It anticipates the needs of the network by intelligently *reconstructing* packets before they even reach their destination, reducing latency and improving overall network performance.
