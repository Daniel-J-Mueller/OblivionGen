## Adaptive Trust Scoring & Dynamic Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the "trusted device" concept beyond simple binary recognition. Implement a dynamic trust score for each device, influenced by usage patterns, security posture (OS updates, anti-malware), and contextual factors (location, network). Couple this with a dynamic resource allocation system that *gradually* increases access privileges based on the trust score.

**Specifications:**

**1. Trust Score Components:**

*   **Baseline Score:** Assigned at initial device registration (e.g., 50/100).
*   **Usage History:**  Points awarded for consistent, legitimate access patterns. Penalties for anomalous activity (time of day, access volume, resource types).
*   **Security Posture:**  API integration with device security systems to verify OS update status, anti-malware definitions, firewall enabled. Score adjustments based on compliance.
*   **Contextual Analysis:** Geo-fencing. Network analysis (trusted/public networks). Time-of-day weighting.
*   **Behavioral Biometrics:**  Monitor user interaction patterns (typing speed, mouse movements) for deviations indicating potential compromise.

**2. Scoring Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(deviceId) {
  let baseScore = 50;
  let usageScore = getUsageScore(deviceId); // Returns 0-30
  let securityScore = getSecurityScore(deviceId); // Returns 0-20
  let contextualScore = getContextualScore(deviceId); // Returns 0-10
  let behavioralScore = getBehavioralScore(deviceId); // Returns 0-10

  let totalScore = baseScore + usageScore + securityScore + contextualScore + behavioralScore;

  //Clamp score between 0 and 100
  return Math.max(0, Math.min(100, totalScore));
}
```

**3. Dynamic Resource Allocation:**

*   **Access Tiers:** Define tiers of access based on trust score (e.g., Tier 1: Basic services, Tier 2: Enhanced features, Tier 3: Full access).
*   **Gradual Privilege Escalation:**  As trust score increases, automatically grant access to higher tiers.
*   **Time-Limited Access:** High-tier access granted for a limited duration. Requires continuous score maintenance.
*   **Automated Revocation:** If trust score falls below a threshold, automatically revoke high-tier access.

**4. System Components:**

*   **Trust Score Engine:** Calculates and stores trust scores for each device.
*   **Policy Engine:** Defines access tiers and corresponding trust score thresholds.
*   **Resource Access Gateway:** Enforces access policies based on trust score.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting System:** Detects anomalies and potential compromises.
*   **API Integrations:**  Device security systems, geolocation services, network analysis tools.

**5.  Device Registration & Initial Trust Establishment:**

*   **Secure Provisioning:** Utilize a secure channel (e.g., hardware-based security module) to provision device credentials and initial trust score.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication:**  Require multi-factor authentication during initial registration and periodically thereafter.
*    **Biometric Enrollment**: Option to use biometrics to tie the user to the device.



This system creates a more nuanced and adaptive security model, reducing the risk of lockout due to compromised devices while providing a smoother user experience.  Instead of a simple "trusted" or "untrusted" designation, devices earn privileges based on demonstrated trustworthiness.
