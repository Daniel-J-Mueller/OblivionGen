## Interactive Projection Mapping for Item Discovery

**Concept:** Extend the item identification and highlighting system into a physical space using projection mapping. Instead of a screen-based UI, the identified items are directly highlighted *onto* the items themselves within the captured image stream.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Depth Sensor: High-resolution depth camera (e.g., Intel RealSense, LiDAR) integrated with the image capturing device. Critical for accurate 3D mapping of the physical space.
    *   Projector: Short-throw, high-lumen projector with keystone correction. Needs to be dynamically adjustable.
    *   Processing Unit: Dedicated GPU and CPU for real-time image processing, 3D reconstruction, and projection mapping calculations.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):** Utilizes data from the depth sensor and image capturing device to create a real-time 3D map of the environment. This map is continuously updated as the device moves.
    *   **Object Recognition & Tracking:**  (Existing from base patent) Identifies items in the image stream. The tracking component associates detected objects with corresponding points in the 3D map.
    *   **Projection Mapping Engine:** This module takes the 3D map, object identifications, and desired highlighting effects (e.g., outlines, color changes) and calculates the necessary projection parameters. It accounts for surface geometry, lighting conditions, and projector placement.
    *   **Interactive UI Layer:** Replaces the thumbnail-based UI with spatial gestures. Users interact with the projected highlights directly. For example:
        *   **Point & Select:** Pointing at a highlighted item selects it.
        *   **Spatial Zoom:** Gestures to zoom in on a specific item or area.
        *   **Information Overlay:** Displaying contextual information about the selected item directly onto the projected surface.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  The device captures a continuous stream of images and depth data.
    2.  SLAM creates a real-time 3D map of the environment.
    3.  Object recognition identifies items in the image stream.
    4.  The projection mapping engine calculates the necessary projection parameters.
    5.  The projector projects highlights onto the identified items, aligning them with their physical location in the 3D map.
    6.  The user interacts with the projected highlights using spatial gestures.

**Pseudocode (Interaction Handling):**

```
function handleGesture(gestureType, gestureData):
  if gestureType == "point":
    targetObject = raycast(gestureData.position, gestureData.direction) // Find object under pointer
    if targetObject != null:
      highlightObject(targetObject)
      displayInfo(targetObject.info)
  elif gestureType == "zoom":
    zoomLevel = gestureData.scale
    adjustProjection(zoomLevel)
  elif gestureType == "pan":
    panOffset = gestureData.offset
    adjustProjection(panOffset)
```

**Novelty:** Moves the UI *into* the physical world, using the environment itself as the display.  The gesture-based interaction is more intuitive and immersive than a traditional screen-based UI. Creates a compelling augmented reality experience for item discovery.
