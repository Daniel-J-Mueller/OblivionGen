## Dynamic Accounting Event Prediction & Visualization

**Concept:** Expand the GUI to not only *visualize* relationships between accounting elements and policies, but to *predict* likely accounting events based on real-time data feeds, and present those predictions within the same interface. This moves beyond reactive accounting to proactive forecasting.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Integration Layer:**

*   **Input Sources:** Connect to live data streams: transactional data (sales, purchases, inventory), market data (exchange rates, commodity prices), external economic indicators (GDP, inflation). APIs for common ERP/CRM systems (Salesforce, SAP, Oracle) essential.
*   **Data Normalization:** A central module responsible for cleaning, transforming, and standardizing data from various sources into a common format suitable for prediction models.
*   **Real-time Feed:**  A persistent WebSocket connection to receive transaction events as they occur, enabling immediate updating of predictions.

**2. Predictive Modeling Engine:**

*   **Model Library:**  A repository of pre-trained machine learning models for different accounting scenarios (revenue forecasting, expense prediction, asset valuation). Support for custom model uploads and training via a dedicated API. Models will initially focus on time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet) and regression techniques.
*   **Scenario Builder:** A GUI tool allowing users to create 'what-if' scenarios by adjusting input parameters (e.g., sales growth rate, interest rates) and observing the impact on predicted accounting events.
*   **Confidence Intervals:** Prediction outputs must include confidence intervals to reflect the uncertainty associated with forecasts.  Visualization of this uncertainty is critical.
*   **Automated Model Selection:** An algorithm to dynamically select the most appropriate prediction model based on the characteristics of the input data and the specific accounting scenario.

**3. GUI Enhancements:**

*   **Prediction Overlay:**  Within the existing GUI (showing relationships between elements and mappings), introduce a translucent 'prediction layer'. This layer displays predicted accounting events (e.g., a predicted journal entry) directly associated with relevant line items.  Predicted values will be displayed with distinct color-coding (e.g., green for positive predictions, red for negative).
*   **Time-Series Visualization:**  Expand line item views to include a time-series chart showing historical values, predicted values, and confidence intervals. Users can zoom and pan the chart to explore data in detail.
*   **Impact Analysis:**  A tool allowing users to trace the impact of changes in input parameters on predicted accounting events. For example, if a user increases the projected sales growth rate, the tool will highlight the corresponding changes in revenue, cost of goods sold, and net income.
*   **Alerting System:**  Configure alerts based on prediction thresholds. For example, alert the user if the predicted revenue falls below a certain level, or if the predicted cost of goods sold exceeds a certain level.
*   **Drill-Down Capability:** Allow users to drill down from a predicted accounting event to the underlying data and assumptions that drove the prediction.

**4. Pseudocode (Prediction Update):**

```
FUNCTION UpdatePredictions(transactionEvent, currentMapping) {
  // 1. Normalize transactionEvent data.
  normalizedEvent = NormalizeData(transactionEvent);

  // 2. Fetch relevant prediction model based on currentMapping.
  model = GetPredictionModel(currentMapping);

  // 3. Generate prediction.
  prediction = model.Predict(normalizedEvent);

  // 4. Calculate confidence interval.
  confidenceInterval = CalculateConfidenceInterval(prediction);

  // 5. Update GUI with prediction and confidence interval.
  UpdateGUIPrediction(prediction, confidenceInterval);

  // 6. Log prediction for audit trail.
  LogPrediction(prediction);
}
```
