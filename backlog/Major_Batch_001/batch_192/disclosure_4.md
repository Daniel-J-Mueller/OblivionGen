**Adaptive Spectral Presets via Biofeedback**

**System Specifications:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrated biometric sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance, pupil dilation) embedded in device housing/frame (TV bezel, monitor stand, wearable glasses). Optional external sensor connectivity (Bluetooth/WiFi).
*   **Processing Unit:** On-device embedded processor with dedicated neural network accelerator for real-time biofeedback analysis. Cloud connectivity for model updates and data analytics (optional, privacy-focused mode available).
*   **Display Control:** Direct control over individual light emitters (LEDs, MicroLEDs, OLEDs) or color channels. Granular control over wavelength/spectral power distribution.
*   **Software:**
    *   Biofeedback analysis module: Processes sensor data to determine user arousal, cognitive load, and emotional state.
    *   Spectral mapping module: Translates biofeedback data into specific spectral profiles.
    *   Adaptive profile manager: Dynamically adjusts spectral profiles based on user state and content.
    *   User profile manager: Stores personalized spectral preferences and historical biofeedback data.
    *   Content analysis module: Analyzes displayed content (scene detection, color palette, motion analysis) to inform spectral adjustments.
*   **Communication:** Secure communication protocols for data transmission and remote updates.

**Innovation Description:**

The system moves beyond pre-defined spectral profiles triggered by content type or time of day. Instead, it directly responds to the user’s physiological state.

1.  **Baseline Calibration:** During initial setup, the system establishes a baseline physiological profile for the user in a neutral state (e.g., eyes closed, relaxed).
2.  **Real-time Monitoring:** Biometric sensors continuously monitor the user’s physiological signals.
3.  **State Detection:** The biofeedback analysis module identifies the user’s current state (e.g., focused, stressed, relaxed, fatigued).
4.  **Spectral Adjustment:** Based on the detected state, the spectral mapping module selects or generates a spectral profile optimized for that state. Profiles are not limited to blue light reduction. They can include:
    *   **Increased red/orange wavelengths** to promote relaxation or warmth.
    *   **Green/yellow enhancements** to improve focus and cognitive performance.
    *   **Narrowband light stimulation** (specific wavelengths shown to affect mood or alertness).
    *   **Dynamic spectral shifting** – gradual changes in wavelength distribution to influence user state over time.
5.  **Content Integration:** The content analysis module provides contextual information to refine spectral adjustments. For example, a suspenseful scene might trigger a slight increase in contrast and saturation, while a calming nature scene might prioritize warmer wavelengths.
6.  **Personalization & Learning:** The system learns user preferences over time, adjusting spectral profiles to maximize comfort and effectiveness.

**Pseudocode Example (Spectral Adjustment Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    READ biometric data (HRV, skin conductance, pupil dilation)
    ANALYZE data to determine user state (focused, stressed, relaxed, fatigued)
    READ content metadata (scene type, color palette, motion)
    SELECT base spectral profile based on user state
    MODIFY profile based on content metadata
    APPLY spectral profile to display
    RECORD user response (optional feedback input)
    UPDATE personalization model
    WAIT (e.g., 100ms)
ENDLOOP
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Enhanced Productivity:** Optimize lighting for focus and cognitive performance.
*   **Stress Reduction:** Create a calming and relaxing viewing experience.
*   **Improved Sleep:** Gradually reduce stimulating wavelengths to promote sleep onset.
*   **Gaming Immersion:** Dynamically adjust lighting to match in-game events and environments.
*   **Accessibility:** Tailor lighting to individual visual needs and sensitivities.
