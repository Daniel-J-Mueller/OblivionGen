## Adaptive Projection Mapping for Product Customization

**Concept:** Extend the selection region concept to incorporate real-time, customizable projection mapping directly *onto* the 3D product image. This allows users to visualize modifications (color, texture, added features) dynamically, responding to their selections.

**Specs:**

1.  **Projection Mesh Generation:**
    *   Input: 3D product model (same as used for rendering in the original patent).
    *   Process: Generate a dynamically updating, high-resolution mesh representing the surface of the 3D model. This mesh will serve as the canvas for the projection mapping. Utilize a shader-based approach for real-time deformation and texture application.
    *   Output: Projection mesh data (vertex positions, normals, UV coordinates).

2.  **Selection Region Integration:**
    *   Maintain the Voronoi region/selection point logic from the original patent.
    *   Each Voronoi region is mapped to a specific *material property* or *add-on feature* (e.g., “Change color,” “Add racing stripe,” “Upgrade tire tread”).
    *   When a user selects a Voronoi region, a corresponding “customization palette” is presented.

3.  **Customization Palette:**
    *   Dynamic UI element presented after Voronoi region selection.
    *   Content: A set of sliders, color pickers, texture selectors, and/or predefined style options relevant to the selected region’s property.
    *   Real-time Feedback: Changes in the palette are immediately reflected in the projection mapping on the 3D model.

4.  **Dynamic Shader System:**
    *   Use a programmable shader (e.g., GLSL, HLSL) to render the 3D model with the customized materials and textures.
    *   The shader receives input from the customization palette and applies the corresponding changes to the material properties (color, texture, roughness, metallicness, etc.).
    *   Support for procedural textures and dynamic material effects.

5.  **Multi-Layer Projection:**
    *   Allow users to apply multiple customizations simultaneously.
    *   Implement a layering system to control the order in which customizations are applied. For example, a user might first change the base color, then add a decal, and finally apply a protective coating.

6.  **AR/VR Integration:**
    *   Extend the system to support augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) environments.
    *   In AR, project the customized 3D model onto a real-world surface.
    *   In VR, allow users to interact with the customized 3D model in a virtual environment.

**Pseudocode (Shader Update):**

```
// Inside the fragment shader
vec3 baseColor = texture(baseTexture, uv);
vec3 customizationColor = getCustomizationColor(uv, selectionRegion);

// Blend base color with customization color
vec3 finalColor = mix(baseColor, customizationColor, customizationIntensity);

// Apply texture overlays
vec3 textureOverlay = texture(textureOverlayMap, uv);
finalColor *= textureOverlay;

// Apply effects (roughness, metallicness, etc.)
finalColor *= roughness;
finalColor *= metallicness;

//Output final color
FragColor = vec4(finalColor, 1.0);
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-performance GPU for real-time rendering.
*   High-resolution display for detailed visualization.
*   Optional: Projector for AR applications.
*   Optional: Motion tracking sensors for interactive AR/VR experiences.
