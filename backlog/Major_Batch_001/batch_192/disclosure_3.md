## Dynamic Environmental Projection Mapping

**Concept:** Expand the environmental awareness of the patent into a system that projects dynamic lighting and textures *onto* real-world surfaces, effectively augmenting the environment to match the displayed image. This moves beyond simply rendering color on a display and creates a mixed-reality effect.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution, short-throw projectors (multiple, networked).  Minimum 4K resolution, high lumens output.  Integrated with tracking systems.
    *   Depth sensors (LiDAR or structured light) to map the environment in real-time. Multiple sensors for full room coverage.
    *   High-precision tracking system (IMU, camera-based tracking, UWB) for device and user head/hand tracking.
    *   Dedicated processing unit (GPU-intensive) for real-time rendering and projection mapping.
    *   Ambient light sensor array â€“ to accurately gauge existing lighting conditions
*   **Software:**
    *   **Environmental Mapping Module:**  Uses depth sensors to create a 3D mesh of the environment.  Continuous real-time updating of the mesh.
    *   **Lighting Analysis Module:** Analyzes the captured image and identifies light sources, their intensity, color, and direction.
    *   **Projection Mapping Engine:** Renders the image (as in the patent) *and* generates corresponding projection maps for the projectors.  This includes:
        *   Calculating the optimal projection angles and distortions to align the projected image with the physical surfaces.
        *   Dynamically adjusting the projected color and intensity to blend seamlessly with the ambient light and the rendered image.
        *   BRDF implementation is paramount - rendering materials accurately for the projected light source.
    *   **Tracking Integration:** Integrates with the tracking system to adjust the projection based on the user's viewpoint and movement. This maintains the illusion of correct lighting and texture mapping even as the user moves around.
    *   **Content Generation/Import:**  Accepts standard image/video formats *and* allows for the creation of procedural textures and lighting effects.
*   **Pseudocode (Projection Mapping Engine Core):**

```
function generateProjectionMap(surfaceMesh, lightData, renderedImage, viewerPosition):
    // surfaceMesh: 3D mesh of the surface to be projected onto
    // lightData: Information about light sources in the scene (position, intensity, color)
    // renderedImage: The image rendered according to the patent's logic
    // viewerPosition: The position of the viewer

    projectionMap = new Map()
    for each vertex in surfaceMesh:
        // Calculate the ray from the projector to the vertex
        rayDirection = vertex - projectorPosition

        // Calculate the angle of incidence of light from the scene
        incidenceAngle = calculateAngle(rayDirection, lightData.direction)

        // Apply BRDF to calculate the reflected light intensity
        reflectedIntensity = applyBRDF(incidenceAngle, surfaceMaterial, lightData.color, lightData.intensity)

        // Adjust the color of the vertex based on the reflected intensity
        vertex.color = vertex.color * reflectedIntensity

        // Calculate the distortion needed to align the projected image with the vertex
        distortion = calculateDistortion(vertex, projectorPosition, viewerPosition)

        // Store the distortion and color information in the projection map
        projectionMap.add(vertex, { color: vertex.color, distortion: distortion })
    return projectionMap
```

*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Augmented Reality:** Projects virtual objects and lighting onto the real world.
    *   **Environmental Simulation:**  Recreates different lighting conditions and textures to simulate various environments (e.g., sunrise, sunset, rain).
    *   **Interactive Projection:**  Allows users to interact with the projected environment (e.g., change the lighting, add virtual objects).

*   **Key Innovations:**
    *   Moving beyond display rendering to *physical* light manipulation.
    *   Real-time dynamic projection mapping based on environmental analysis and user tracking.
    *   The integration of BRDF and ambient light sensing for realistic lighting effects.
    *   Creating a truly immersive and interactive mixed-reality experience.
