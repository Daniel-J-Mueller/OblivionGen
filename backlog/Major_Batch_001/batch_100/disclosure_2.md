## Dynamic Data Masking with Behavioral Analysis

**Concept:** Extend data loss prevention beyond static encryption to incorporate dynamic data masking based on observed user behavior and contextual risk scoring. This goes beyond simply encrypting sensitive data; it *transforms* the data presented to the user based on their established access patterns and current actions, minimizing data exposure *while maintaining usability*.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profiling Module:**

*   **Data Collection:** Continuously monitors user activity within applications accessing sensitive data. Logs include:
    *   Data access patterns (fields accessed, frequency, time of day)
    *   Application usage (applications used, sequence of operations)
    *   Geographic location (IP address, GPS if available)
    *   Device information (device type, operating system)
*   **Baseline Creation:** Establishes a baseline of “normal” behavior for each user. Utilizes statistical methods (e.g., time series analysis, clustering) to identify typical access patterns.  Baseline updated dynamically.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies deviations from the established baseline. Implements machine learning models (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forests) to detect anomalous behavior.  Severity score assigned to each anomaly.

**2. Contextual Risk Engine:**

*   **Data Classification:** Automatically classifies data based on sensitivity levels (e.g., PII, PCI, PHI).
*   **Policy Definition:** Allows administrators to define policies that specify data masking rules based on:
    *   Data classification level
    *   User role
    *   Anomaly score from Behavioral Profiling Module
    *   Geographic location
    *   Time of day
*   **Risk Scoring:**  Combines inputs from data classification, anomaly detection, and policy definition to generate a real-time risk score.

**3. Dynamic Data Masking Layer:**

*   **Masking Techniques:** Supports a range of masking techniques, including:
    *   Redaction (removing data entirely)
    *   Substitution (replacing data with dummy values)
    *   Tokenization (replacing data with non-sensitive tokens)
    *   Encryption (encrypting data with a key accessible only to authorized systems)
    *   Generalization (reducing precision, e.g., replacing a specific date with a month)
    *   Format-Preserving Encryption (maintaining data format while encrypting)
*   **Adaptive Masking:**  Dynamically applies masking techniques based on the real-time risk score.
    *   Low Risk: No masking.
    *   Medium Risk: Apply less aggressive masking techniques (e.g., generalization, tokenization).
    *   High Risk: Apply more aggressive masking techniques (e.g., redaction, encryption).
*   **User Interface Modification:** Modifies the user interface to present masked data seamlessly. For example:
    *   Replace sensitive fields with asterisks.
    *   Display a masked version of a credit card number.
    *   Provide a warning message indicating that data is being masked.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processDataRequest(user, data) {
  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(user, data);

  maskedData = data;

  if (riskScore > HIGH_THRESHOLD) {
    maskedData = applyMasking(data, AGGRESSIVE_MASKING);
  } else if (riskScore > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD) {
    maskedData = applyMasking(data, MODERATE_MASKING);
  }

  return maskedData;
}

function calculateRiskScore(user, data) {
  anomalyScore = getAnomalyScore(user);
  dataSensitivity = getDataSensitivity(data);
  locationRisk = getLocationRisk(user);

  riskScore = anomalyScore * 0.4 + dataSensitivity * 0.3 + locationRisk * 0.3;

  return riskScore;
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Real-time data processing engine.
*   Machine learning platform.
*   Secure key management system.
*   Integration with existing authentication and authorization systems.
*   Auditing and logging capabilities.
