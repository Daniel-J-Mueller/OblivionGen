## Secure Email ‘Ghosting’ – Dynamic Recipient Obfuscation

**Concept:** Extend the existing encrypted delivery system to include a layer of dynamic recipient obfuscation. Instead of directly routing to the intended recipient’s mail server, the system temporarily routes the email through a series of intermediary, trusted ‘ghost’ servers before final delivery. This adds a layer of privacy and complicates metadata tracking.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Ghost Server Network:** Establish a distributed network of secure, trusted servers (the ‘ghost’ network). These servers are operated by us, and maintain high security standards.  Servers must support the same encryption protocols as the source/destination.  Minimum geographic distribution of 5 regions.

2.  **Obfuscation Level Setting:** Within the email client, provide a setting for ‘Obfuscation Level’ (Low, Medium, High). This controls the number of ‘hops’ the email takes through the ghost network.

    *   **Low (1 hop):** Email routed through a single random ghost server before final delivery. Minimal overhead.
    *   **Medium (3 hops):** Email routed through a chain of 3 random ghost servers. Moderate overhead.
    *   **High (5+ hops):** Email routed through a longer, more complex chain of ghost servers.  Significant overhead, maximum obfuscation.

3.  **Path Determination Algorithm:** Implement an algorithm to dynamically determine the path through the ghost network. Considerations:

    *   **Latency:** Prioritize paths with the lowest latency.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic evenly across ghost servers.
    *   **Geographic Diversity:** Ensure path includes servers in diverse geographic locations.
    *   **Hop Count:** Enforce maximum hop count based on ‘Obfuscation Level’.

4.  **Encryption Protocol Negotiation:**  Each hop in the ghost network *must* re-encrypt the email using a fresh, temporary key before forwarding. The encryption protocol should be negotiated between each server, ensuring compatibility and maintaining end-to-end encryption.  Initial encryption is maintained from the source.

5.  **Metadata Stripping:** At each hop, remove or anonymize metadata that could be used for tracking (e.g., original sender IP address, timestamps, routing information). Replace with data indicating the current server's IP and a randomized timestamp.

6.  **Delivery Confirmation:** Implement a delivery confirmation mechanism that works across the ghost network. This is complex, and requires a unique identifier assigned to the email at the source, propagated through each hop, and acknowledged by the final destination.

7.  **Client-Side Integration:** Modify the email client to:

    *   Display ‘Obfuscation Level’ setting.
    *   Handle delivery confirmation across the ghost network.
    *   Provide visual indicator of obfuscation status (e.g., icon indicating active obfuscation).

**Pseudocode (Client-Side – Sending):**

```
function sendEmail(recipient, subject, body, obfuscationLevel) {
  encryptionFlag = true  // Ensure encryption is enabled
  encryptionType = "TLS1.3" //Specify encryption type

  //Generate unique email ID
  emailID = generateUniqueID()

  //Construct email with ID and encryption flag
  email = constructEmail(recipient, subject, body, encryptionFlag, encryptionType, emailID)

  //Determine ghost network path based on obfuscationLevel
  path = determineGhostNetworkPath(obfuscationLevel)

  //Send email to first server in path
  sendToGhostServer(email, path[0], emailID)
}

function sendToGhostServer(email, serverAddress, emailID) {
  //Establish secure connection to server
  connection = establishSecureConnection(serverAddress)

  //Send email, indicating next server in the path
  send(connection, email, path[path.indexOf(serverAddress) + 1], emailID)

  //Close connection
}
```

**Potential Downsides:**

*   Increased latency due to multiple hops.
*   Complexity of managing the ghost network and ensuring its reliability.
*   Potential for abuse (e.g., use for malicious purposes).
*   Requires significant infrastructure investment.
