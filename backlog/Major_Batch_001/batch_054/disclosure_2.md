## Adaptive Data ‘Shadowing’ with Predictive Prefetching & Tiered Encryption

**Concept:** Extend the tiered storage concept by introducing ‘shadow copies’ of data proactively created *before* access, based on predicted usage patterns, but with a layered encryption approach that adapts to the storage tier and data sensitivity. This differs from simple replication; it’s about *anticipatory* data placement with variable security.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Modeling Module:**

*   **Input:** Access logs (file access timestamps, frequency, size), user/application profiles, data type (identified via metadata or content analysis – e.g., document, image, database), time-of-day, day-of-week, external events (e.g., scheduled reports).
*   **Processing:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to predict future data access patterns for each file/object.  Model outputs probability distributions for future access times and data usage amounts.
*   **Output:**  'Shadowing Profile' for each file/object – indicating probability of access within specific time windows, estimated data usage, and sensitivity level (derived from metadata or user-defined policies).

**2. Tiered Storage Infrastructure:**

*   **Storage Tiers:** Define multiple storage tiers with varying cost, performance, and security characteristics:
    *   **Tier 0: Ultra-Fast (e.g., NVMe SSD):**  For hot data and critical applications.  Highest performance, highest cost, full encryption (AES-256).
    *   **Tier 1: Fast (e.g., SAS SSD):**  For frequently accessed data. High performance, medium cost, strong encryption (AES-192).
    *   **Tier 2: Balanced (e.g., SATA SSD/NVMe):** For moderately accessed data. Medium performance, low cost, standard encryption (AES-128).
    *   **Tier 3: Capacity (e.g., HDD/Object Storage):** For infrequently accessed data/archives. Low performance, lowest cost, minimal encryption (e.g., client-side encryption, transparent data encryption).
*   **Metadata Service:** Maintains mapping between file/object ID, shadowing profile, current storage location, and encryption key/method.

**3.  Shadowing Engine:**

*   **Trigger:** Activated by Predictive Modeling Module indicating a high probability of access within a specific time window.
*   **Process:**
    *   Allocate space for a shadow copy on a target storage tier *before* the predicted access. Tier selection based on shadowing profile (predicted access frequency, data sensitivity, and cost).
    *   Initiate asynchronous data copy to the target tier. Use delta encoding/compression to minimize transfer overhead.
    *   Update Metadata Service with the location of the shadow copy and corresponding encryption key.
    *   Implement a "just-in-time" encryption scheme: encrypt the shadow copy *during* the transfer to the target tier using the appropriate encryption method for that tier.
*   **Prefetching:** When access is predicted, prefetch the shadow copy *before* the actual request arrives, improving responsiveness.

**4.  Access Interceptor:**

*   **Function:** Intercepts all file/object access requests.
*   **Logic:**
    *   Check Metadata Service for the existence of a shadow copy.
    *   If a shadow copy exists, serve the request from the shadow copy.
    *   If no shadow copy exists, access the original data source.
    *   Log access details for Predictive Modeling Module.

**5.  Eviction Policy:**

*   **Mechanism:** Implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) or Least Frequently Used (LFU) policy to automatically evict shadow copies when storage capacity is reached.
*   **Considerations:** Prioritize eviction based on the cost of accessing the original data source versus the cost of retaining the shadow copy.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Predictive Modeling Module
function predictAccess(fileId) {
  accessHistory = getAccessHistory(fileId);
  prediction = timeSeriesForecast(accessHistory);
  return prediction;
}

// Shadowing Engine
function createShadowCopy(fileId) {
  prediction = predictAccess(fileId);
  targetTier = selectTier(prediction);
  allocateSpace(targetTier, fileSize);
  copyData(originalLocation, targetTier);
  encryptData(targetTier, encryptionMethod(targetTier));
  updateMetadata(fileId, targetTier);
}

// Access Interceptor
function handleAccessRequest(fileId) {
  shadowCopyLocation = getShadowCopyLocation(fileId);
  if (shadowCopyLocation != null) {
    serveFrom(shadowCopyLocation);
  } else {
    serveFrom(originalLocation);
  }
}

```

**Novelty:** The proactive nature of data placement based on predicted access, combined with tiered encryption adapting to both storage performance *and* security requirements, distinguishes this approach from traditional caching or tiered storage solutions. It moves beyond simply optimizing performance and considers dynamic security needs based on data access patterns.
