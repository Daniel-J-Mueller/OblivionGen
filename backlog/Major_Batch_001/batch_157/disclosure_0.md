## Secure Key Shard Distribution with Dynamic Re-Encryption

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of key import/export with a system for *splitting* cryptographic keys into multiple shards, distributing those shards across geographically diverse and administratively independent entities, and dynamically re-encrypting those shards based on access control policies and threat models. This addresses single points of failure and enhances security against compromise or collusion.

**Specs:**

*   **Key Shard Generation:**
    *   Algorithm: Utilize Secret Sharing (e.g., Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing) to divide a master cryptographic key into *n* shares (shards). *n* is configurable.
    *   Shard Encryption: Each shard is individually encrypted using a unique, randomly generated symmetric key. These symmetric keys are then encrypted using the public keys of the intended recipient entities.
    *   Metadata:  Each shard includes metadata specifying:
        *   Shard Index (e.g., 1 of 10)
        *   Total Number of Shards
        *   Threshold Value (minimum number of shards required for reconstruction)
        *   Recipient Entity Identifier
        *   Timestamp
        *   Digital Signature (signed by the key owner)

*   **Shard Distribution Service:**
    *   Secure Channel: Establish a mutually authenticated, encrypted communication channel with recipient entities.
    *   Distribution Protocol:  Distribute shards to designated entities.  Each shard delivery is logged and auditable.
    *   Redundancy: Implement a mechanism for distributing redundant shards to enhance availability.
    *   Geo-Distribution: Support specification of geographic regions for shard placement (e.g., "Distribute shards such that no two shards reside in the same country").

*   **Dynamic Re-Encryption Module:**
    *   Policy Engine: Integrate with an access control policy engine (e.g., Attribute-Based Encryption).
    *   Re-Encryption Trigger:  Monitor for changes in access control policies, threat intelligence feeds, or pre-defined schedules.
    *   Re-Encryption Process:
        *   Identify shards requiring re-encryption.
        *   Decrypt the current shard using the domain cryptographic key.
        *   Re-encrypt the shard using a new symmetric key derived from the updated access control policies.
        *   Securely transmit the updated shard to the recipient entity.
        *   Revoke access to the old shard.

*   **Key Reconstruction Service:**
    *   Shard Collection: Receive shard requests from authorized entities.
    *   Threshold Verification:  Verify that the number of received shards meets or exceeds the defined threshold.
    *   Signature Verification: Validate digital signatures on each shard.
    *   Reconstruction Algorithm:  Utilize the secret sharing algorithm to reconstruct the original master key.

**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructKey(shardList) {
  if (shardList.length < threshold) {
    return "Insufficient shards";
  }

  for (shard in shardList) {
    if (!verifySignature(shard)) {
      return "Signature verification failed";
    }
  }

  // Apply Shamir's Secret Sharing reconstruction algorithm
  reconstructedKey = reconstruct(shardList);

  return reconstructedKey;
}
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Temporal Shards:** Implement shards with expiration dates, forcing periodic re-encryption and rotation of keys.
*   **Quorum-Based Access:** Require a quorum of entities to approve key reconstruction requests.
*   **Blockchain Integration:** Utilize a blockchain for tamper-proof auditing of shard distribution and access control changes.
*   **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** Leverage HSMs to protect domain cryptographic keys and perform cryptographic operations in a secure environment.
