## Dynamic Shelf Resonance System

**Concept:** Integrate resonant frequency modulation into the shelf structure to detect and categorize items placed upon it *without* weight sensors or vision systems. This creates a ‘silent’ inventory system, ideal for sensitive materials or high-speed applications.

**Specifications:**

*   **Shelf Material:** Composite material – layered carbon fiber with embedded piezoelectric elements. The ratio of carbon fiber to piezoelectric material is adjustable during manufacturing for tuning.
*   **Piezoelectric Element Configuration:** A grid pattern of small (5mm x 5mm) piezoelectric sensors embedded *within* the shelf layers, not simply adhered to the surface. Density: 20 sensors per 100cm².
*   **Excitation System:** Low-power electromagnetic actuator coupled to the shelf frame. Frequency range: 20 Hz – 500 Hz. Amplitude control via PWM signal.
*   **Resonance Detection:** Dedicated microcontroller (ESP32 or similar) with integrated ADC. Algorithms to analyze frequency response shifts (Δf) and amplitude damping (ΔA) caused by object placement.
*   **Calibration Phase:** Initial baseline scan of empty shelf to establish ‘native’ resonance signature. Automated calibration routine triggered upon system startup or shelf re-configuration.
*   **Object Categorization:** Machine learning model (TensorFlow Lite or similar) trained on resonance signatures of known objects. Model to predict object type and estimated volume/density.
*   **Power Supply:** Wireless power transfer (Qi standard) or low-voltage DC input.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for data transmission to central inventory management system.
*   **Data Logging:** Internal flash memory for temporary data storage in case of communication failure.
*   **Structural Reinforcement:** Internal rib structure within the shelf to minimize deformation and maintain resonance stability.

**Pseudocode (Object Identification):**

```
//Initialization
calibrate_shelf() // Establish baseline resonance signature

//Loop
while (true) {
    acquire_resonance_data() // Measure current resonance frequency & amplitude
    delta_f = current_frequency - baseline_frequency
    delta_a = current_amplitude - baseline_amplitude

    // Feature vector: [delta_f, delta_a]

    predicted_class = ml_model.predict(feature_vector) // Use trained ML model

    if (predicted_class == "unknown") {
        //Implement anomaly detection/alerting
    }
    
    transmit_data(predicted_class) // Send data to central inventory system
    delay(100ms)
}
```

**Novelty:** Current weight/vision-based systems require direct contact or line of sight. This system passively detects objects through subtle changes in the shelf’s resonant behavior. This provides a 'hands-free' inventory option. The piezoelectric grid provides a detailed 'fingerprint' of the loaded item. The machine learning model learns unique resonant signatures for each object to achieve high accuracy.
