## Secure Resource Access via Dynamic Reputation Propagation

**System Overview:**

This system expands upon the concept of social circle verification but moves beyond static friend lists and simple reputation scores. It proposes a dynamic, propagating reputation system where trust isn’t inherent to individuals but *flows* between them based on interactions related to secured resource access.

**Core Components:**

*   **Interaction Graph:** A directed graph where nodes represent users and edges represent interactions *specifically related to access requests*.  An edge isn't just 'knows', but 'verified access for user X' or 'denied access for user Y'.  Edge weight represents confidence in that interaction (determined by the verification process in the base patent, but also by frequency of interaction).
*   **Trust Propagation Algorithm:**  A modified PageRank-like algorithm that propagates trust through the Interaction Graph. The initial trust score of a user is low.  Trust increases when a high-trust user verifies access for them. Trust *decreases* when a high-trust user denies access or flags suspicious activity. The algorithm should prioritize recent interactions.
*   **Resource-Specific Trust Profiles:**  Each secured resource maintains a trust profile. This profile defines acceptable trust levels for access. It also defines 'trust pathways' – specific nodes or subgraphs that represent authoritative verifiers for *that resource*. For example, a financial resource might prioritize verifiers within the banking industry.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Access isn't based on a fixed trust threshold. The system dynamically adjusts the threshold based on the sensitivity of the resource and the current threat landscape.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Data Structures:**
    *   `User Node`: {`userID`, `trustScore`, `lastUpdated`, `friendList` (from base patent), `interactionHistory` (list of interaction events)}
    *   `Resource Profile`: {`resourceID`, `accessPolicy`, `requiredTrustLevel`, `trustPathways` (list of UserIDs), `sensitivityLevel`}
    *   `Interaction Event`: {`initiatingUserID`, `targetUserID`, `resourceID`, `accessGranted`, `confidenceLevel`, `timestamp`}

2.  **Initialization:**
    *   All users start with a default `trustScore` of 0.1.
    *   Resource Profiles are manually configured with `accessPolicy`, `requiredTrustLevel`, and `trustPathways`.

3.  **Access Request Workflow:**

    1.  Client requests access to a resource.
    2.  System retrieves the `Resource Profile`.
    3.  System calculates the requesting user’s `effectiveTrustScore` by:
        *   Calculating the Trust Propagation Score: Run the trust propagation algorithm (see Pseudocode).
        *   Applying weighting based on `trustPathways`. Users within preferred pathways receive a boost.
    4.  If `effectiveTrustScore` >= `requiredTrustLevel`, access is granted.
    5.  If access is granted, an `Interaction Event` is created and logged.
    6.  If access is denied, the event is logged for anomaly detection.

4.  **Trust Propagation Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

    ```
    function calculateTrustScores(InteractionGraph, currentEpoch):
        for each UserNode u in InteractionGraph:
            u.trustScore = 0.1  // Reset to default
            for each incoming edge (v, u) with weight w:
                u.trustScore += v.trustScore * w // Propagate trust
            u.trustScore = (1 - dampingFactor) * u.trustScore + dampingFactor * (initialTrustScore / numUsers) // Add initial Trust
        return InteractionGraph
    ```

    *   `dampingFactor`: Controls the rate of trust propagation.
    *   `initialTrustScore`:  A small initial trust value.
    *   The algorithm should be run periodically or triggered by significant events (e.g., new access requests, flagged activity).

5.  **Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Monitor `Interaction Events` for suspicious patterns (e.g., high denial rates, unusual access patterns).
    *   Flag users or resources exhibiting anomalous behavior.
    *   Adjust `requiredTrustLevel` or `trustPathways` dynamically in response to detected threats.

6.  **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   Allow users to control the visibility of their interaction history.
    *   Implement data anonymization techniques to protect user privacy.
    *   Comply with relevant privacy regulations.

This system moves beyond simple friend verification by building a dynamic trust network that adapts to changing conditions and incorporates more nuanced factors.  It provides a more robust and secure approach to access control.
