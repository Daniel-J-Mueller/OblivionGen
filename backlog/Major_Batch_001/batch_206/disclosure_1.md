## Adaptive Metric Weighting System

**Concept:** Extend the existing experiment framework to dynamically adjust the weight of different metrics during result data determination, based on real-time user behavior and feature engagement. This moves beyond simple averaging or predefined weighting schemes to a system that *learns* which metrics are most indicative of long-term effect.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A “Metric Weighting Engine” (MWE) integrated into the server-side infrastructure.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Raw metric data (as currently collected: click-through rates, time spent, conversion rates, etc.) from both control and treatment groups.
    *   Real-time user behavior data:  Scrolling depth, mouse movements (heatmaps), form completion rates (partial data), and application feature usage frequency.
    *   External data sources: demographic information (if available/permitted), time of day, device type.
*   **MWE Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

    ```
    FUNCTION CalculateMetricWeights(rawMetricData, userBehaviorData, externalData):
        // 1. Feature Engineering: Combine raw metrics and behavioral data into a 
        //    comprehensive feature set.  Example: "Time Spent * Scrolling Depth"
        features = EngineerFeatures(rawMetricData, userBehaviorData)

        // 2. Model Training: Train a regression model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
        //    to predict a “long-term value” metric (defined separately - see below).  
        //    The features are input, and the long-term value is the target.
        model = TrainRegressionModel(features, longTermValue)

        // 3. Feature Importance: Extract feature importance scores from the trained model.
        //    These scores represent the relative weight of each metric.
        featureImportance = GetFeatureImportance(model)

        // 4. Normalization: Normalize the feature importance scores to sum to 1.
        metricWeights = Normalize(featureImportance)

        RETURN metricWeights
    ```

*   **Long-Term Value Metric:**  A crucial component.  Needs careful definition based on business goals. Examples:
    *   **For a subscription service:**  Probability of renewal after 3 months.
    *   **For an e-commerce site:** Total lifetime value of the customer.
    *   **For an app:** Average daily active users over the following month.
*   **Integration with Result Data Determination:**
    *   The MWE calculates `metricWeights` at regular intervals (e.g., every hour, every day).
    *   When calculating `resultData`, each metric is multiplied by its corresponding `metricWeight` *before* aggregation.
*   **A/B Testing of MWE:**  Essential!  Run A/B tests comparing experiments using the adaptive weighting system against those using fixed weighting.
*   **Data Storage:** Store historical `metricWeights` alongside experiment data for analysis and auditing.
*   **User Interface:** Dashboard for monitoring `metricWeights` and observing how they change over time.  Allow manual overrides (with caution!) for specific experiments.

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased server load due to real-time model training and inference.  Requires scalable infrastructure.
*   Potentially benefit from GPU acceleration for model training.
