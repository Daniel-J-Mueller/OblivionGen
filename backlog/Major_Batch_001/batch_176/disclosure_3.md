## Dynamic Network Persona System

**Concept:** Leverage the virtual network creation and access control mechanisms to create and dynamically assign ‘Network Personas’ to client devices. These personas aren't just access control lists; they represent fully realized, temporary network environments tailored to specific tasks or applications.

**Specifications:**

*   **Persona Definition Language (PDL):** A structured language for defining network personas. PDL elements include:
    *   `NetworkTopology`: Specifies the virtual network configuration (IP ranges, subnets, routing rules).
    *   `ServiceBindings`: Links the persona to specific cloud or on-premise services. (e.g., database instances, API endpoints).
    *   `SecurityProfile`: Defines firewall rules, intrusion detection settings, and data encryption policies.
    *   `ResourceLimits`: Sets CPU, memory, and bandwidth constraints for the persona.
    *   `EphemeralDuration`: Specifies the lifetime of the persona (time-to-live).
*   **Persona Orchestration Engine:** A component responsible for:
    *   Parsing PDL definitions.
    *   Creating and configuring virtual networks based on PDL.
    *   Assigning virtual network addresses to client devices.
    *   Dynamically adjusting resources based on usage.
    *   Monitoring persona health and enforcing EphemeralDuration.
*   **Client-Side Persona Agent:**  Software running on the client device to:
    *   Request personas based on application requirements.
    *   Handle persona activation/deactivation.
    *   Tunnel traffic through the assigned virtual network.
    *   Report usage metrics to the orchestration engine.
*   **API Endpoints:** 
    *   `POST /personas`:  Creates a new persona definition. (Requires PDL as input)
    *   `GET /personas/{persona_id}`: Retrieves a persona definition.
    *   `POST /clients/{client_id}/activate/{persona_id}`: Activates a persona for a client.
    *   `POST /clients/{client_id}/deactivate/{persona_id}`: Deactivates a persona for a client.
*   **Pseudocode (Persona Activation):**

```
FUNCTION ActivatePersona(clientID, personaID)
    // 1. Retrieve Persona Definition
    personaDef = GetPersonaDefinition(personaID)

    // 2. Create Virtual Network
    virtualNetwork = CreateVirtualNetwork(personaDef.NetworkTopology)

    // 3. Bind Services
    FOR EACH service IN personaDef.ServiceBindings
        BindService(virtualNetwork, service)

    // 4. Apply Security Profile
    ApplySecurityProfile(virtualNetwork, personaDef.SecurityProfile)

    // 5. Allocate Virtual Network Address
    virtualAddress = AllocateVirtualAddress(virtualNetwork)

    // 6. Assign Virtual Address to Client
    AssignVirtualAddress(clientID, virtualAddress)

    // 7. Start Traffic Tunnel
    StartTrafficTunnel(clientID, virtualAddress, virtualNetwork)

    // 8. Set Ephemeral Duration Timer
    SetTimer(personaDef.EphemeralDuration, DeactivatePersona(clientID, personaID))

    RETURN SUCCESS
END FUNCTION
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Secure Application Sandboxing:** Launch applications within isolated virtual networks to prevent malicious activity.
*   **Temporary Data Access:** Grant clients temporary access to sensitive data resources via dedicated virtual networks.
*   **Dev/Test Environments:** Quickly provision isolated virtual networks for software development and testing.
*   **Multi-Tenancy:** Provide each tenant with a dedicated virtual network to ensure data privacy and security.
