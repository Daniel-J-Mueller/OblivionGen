## Seed Tree Federation & Dynamic Key Sharding

**Concept:** Extend the seed tree generation and key derivation to a federated network of nodes. Instead of a single authority generating the entire tree, distribute the seed tree generation and key derivation across multiple, geographically diverse nodes. Implement dynamic key sharding, where individual one-time-use keys (or portions thereof) are distributed across these federated nodes.

**Specs:**

*   **Federated Seed Tree Generation:**
    *   Each node in the federation is assigned a portion of the seed tree to generate. This assignment is dynamically determined and can be updated periodically.
    *   Nodes use a consensus mechanism (e.g., Raft, Paxos, or a variant) to ensure consistency in the generated seed tree.
    *   Seed tree branches are assigned to nodes based on a hashing algorithm that distributes the load and mitigates single points of failure.
    *   The root seed value is generated collaboratively; each node contributes a portion of the entropy.
*   **Dynamic Key Sharding:**
    *   One-time-use keys (or key fragments) are distributed across multiple federated nodes.
    *   A secret sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing) is used to divide the key into shares.
    *   Each federated node holds a subset of the key shares.
    *   A minimum number of nodes must collaborate to reconstruct the full key.
*   **Key Reconstruction Protocol:**
    *   A secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocol is used for key reconstruction.
    *   Nodes exchange encrypted key shares.
    *   The full key is reconstructed without any node revealing its share.
*   **Hash Tree Integration:**
    *   Each federated node generates a hash tree from its portion of the one-time-use keys.
    *   These hash trees are integrated into a comprehensive master hash tree.
    *   The master hash tree root acts as the public key for the system.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**
    *   The system is designed to tolerate node failures.
    *   Key shares are replicated across multiple nodes.
    *   If a node fails, its key shares can be reconstructed from other nodes.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   Secure communication channels are used between federated nodes.
    *   Nodes are authenticated and authorized.
    *   The system is protected against Sybil attacks and other malicious attacks.
*   **Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction):**

```
// Node A, B, C each have a key share (shareA, shareB, shareC)
// Requires at least 2 shares to reconstruct the key

function reconstructKey(shareA, shareB, totalShares, threshold) {
  // totalShares: Total number of shares the key was split into
  // threshold: Minimum number of shares needed to reconstruct the key

  // Each node encrypts its share using a public key known by all nodes
  encryptedShareA = encrypt(shareA, publicKey)
  encryptedShareB = encrypt(shareB, publicKey)

  // Nodes exchange encrypted shares

  // Execute a secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocol to reconstruct the key
  // This protocol ensures that no node learns the full key during the process

  // Apply the Lagrange interpolation formula with encrypted shares
  decryptedKey = lagrangeInterpolation(encryptedShares, threshold)

  return decryptedKey
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security through distributed key management
*   Increased resilience to node failures
*   Scalability through federation
*   Reduced trust requirements for any single authority
*   Geographical distribution of keys for enhanced physical security.
