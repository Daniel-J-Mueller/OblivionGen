## Dynamic Auditory Scene Reconstruction & Re-Synthesis

**Concept:** Expand beyond single-stream audio reconstruction to build a multi-layered auditory scene representation, allowing for granular manipulation and re-synthesis of sounds within the reconstructed audio.

**Specifications:**

**1. Scene Decomposition Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw audio data stream.
*   **Process:** Employ a combination of advanced source separation algorithms (e.g., Non-negative Matrix Factorization, Deep Clustering) *and* a novel "Auditory Object Recognition" network. This network is trained to identify likely auditory objects (speech, music, environmental sounds) *and* estimate their spatial characteristics (direction, distance).
*   **Output:** A multi-layered representation of the audio, where each layer corresponds to a detected auditory object. Each layer contains:
    *   Audio data for the object.
    *   Estimated spatial parameters.
    *   Confidence score for the detection.

**2.  Predictive Interpolation Network (PIN):**

*   **Input:** Layered audio data *and* spatial parameters from the Scene Decomposition Module.  Also, a "coherence score" derived from cross-correlation between layers –  indicates how likely objects are interacting (e.g., speech in a room with echoes).
*   **Process:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, but *modified*.  Instead of predicting the *next* audio sample, PIN predicts missing *segments* of audio within each layer based on:
    *   Historical data within the layer.
    *   Correlation with other layers (the coherence score).
    *   A "physical modeling constraint" –  simulates how sound propagates and reflects based on estimated spatial parameters.
*   **Output:**  Interpolated audio segments for each layer.

**3.  Re-Synthesis Engine:**

*   **Input:** Original audio, interpolated segments from PIN, and layer-specific control parameters (e.g., volume, pitch, spatial position).
*   **Process:**
    *   Seamlessly blend the original audio with the interpolated segments.
    *   Apply spatial audio processing (HRTF filtering, reverb) based on the layer-specific control parameters.
    *   Allow *real-time* manipulation of these parameters via a user interface.
*   **Output:** Re-synthesized audio stream.

**4.  Control Interface (Conceptual):**

*   **Visual Representation:** Display a 3D representation of the reconstructed auditory scene, with identified objects positioned in space.
*   **Interactive Controls:**
    *   Select individual objects to adjust their volume, pitch, spatial position, and other parameters.
    *   Apply global effects (e.g., reverb, equalization) to the entire scene.
    *   "Freeze" or "isolate" individual objects for detailed analysis or editing.
    *   "Remix" the scene by adjusting the relative positions and volumes of objects.

**Pseudocode (Re-Synthesis Engine):**

```
function ReSynthesize(originalAudio, interpolatedSegments, controlParameters):
  scene = new AuditoryScene()
  for layer in interpolatedSegments:
    object = new AudioObject(layer.audio, layer.spatialParameters)
    scene.addObject(object)

  for object in scene.objects:
    object.applyControlParameters(controlParameters)
    object.applySpatialAudioProcessing()

  mixedAudio = scene.mixAudio() // Apply blending and mixing algorithms
  return mixedAudio
```

**Novelty:**  

Existing audio reconstruction focuses on *filling gaps*. This design aims to create a fully manipulable *representation* of the auditory scene, enabling unprecedented levels of control and creative possibilities. It moves beyond basic correction to true *auditory scene editing*.
