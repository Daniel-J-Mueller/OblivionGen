## Adaptive File Behavior Profiling

**Concept:** Extend entropy analysis with behavioral profiling to detect anomalies beyond simple encryption. Instead of *just* looking for entropy shifts, build a model of expected file behavior based on usage patterns *before* any potential compromise.

**Specs:**

*   **Profiling Phase:**
    *   Monitor file access patterns (read, write, execute, delete) for a defined period (e.g., 1-4 weeks) for each user and file type.
    *   Record timestamps, access types, user ID, and process initiating access.
    *   Calculate statistical metrics:
        *   Average access frequency per time unit.
        *   Standard deviation of inter-access times.
        *   Common initiating processes.
        *   Typical data size changes during write operations.
        *   User-specific access patterns.
*   **Baseline Creation:**
    *   Generate a behavioral profile for each file or file type (using clustering/grouping to avoid individual file profiles if impractical).
    *   Store profiles in a database with versioning (to account for legitimate changes in usage).
*   **Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Real-time monitoring of file access.
    *   Comparison of current access patterns with the baseline profile.
    *   Anomaly scoring based on deviations from expected behavior.  Metrics used for scoring:
        *   Frequency of access.
        *   Inter-access time variation.
        *   Initiating process deviation.
        *   Data size change anomaly (significant, unexpected increases/decreases).
        *   User deviation (access from an unusual user account).
    *   Adaptive Thresholds: Dynamically adjust anomaly thresholds based on historical data and observed patterns.
*   **Response Actions:**
    *   Trigger alerts based on anomaly scores exceeding predefined thresholds.
    *   Quarantine suspicious files.
    *   Initiate forensic analysis.
    *   Implement dynamic access control restrictions.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detect_anomaly(file, access_type, timestamp, user_id, process_name):
  profile = get_behavior_profile(file)
  if profile is null:
    return false // Not enough historical data

  expected_frequency = profile.average_access_frequency
  expected_interaccess_time = profile.average_interaccess_time
  expected_processes = profile.common_processes

  anomaly_score = 0

  // Frequency Anomaly
  if current_access_frequency > expected_frequency * threshold_frequency_multiplier:
    anomaly_score += score_frequency

  // Interaccess Time Anomaly
  if abs(current_interaccess_time - expected_interaccess_time) > threshold_interaccess_time:
    anomaly_score += score_interaccess

  // Process Anomaly
  if process_name not in expected_processes:
    anomaly_score += score_process

  if anomaly_score > threshold_total:
    return true // Anomaly Detected
  else:
    return false
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   File system monitoring agent (kernel-level or user-level).
*   Database for storing behavioral profiles.
*   Real-time analytics engine.
*   Alerting and reporting system.
*   API for integration with security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
