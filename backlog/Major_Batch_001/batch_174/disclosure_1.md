## Dynamic Scene Graph Partitioning for Predictive Rendering

**Concept:** Extend the shared memory block concept beyond individual nodes to encompass *sections* of the entire rendered scene. Predictively partition the scene graph based on viewport frustum culling and occlusion testing *before* rendering, assigning dynamically sized shared memory blocks to those visible partitions. This allows for aggressive parallelization and minimizes data transfer.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Scene Graph Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Complete scene graph representing the network content.
    *   Process: Perform a pre-render analysis of the scene graph to identify potential visibility. Utilize viewport frustum culling and a lightweight occlusion query system (e.g., hierarchical Z-buffering).
    *   Output:  A partitioned scene graph, where each partition represents a visible section of the scene. Each partition is assigned a unique ID.

2.  **Dynamic Shared Memory Allocation Module:**
    *   Input: Partitioned scene graph, partition IDs, maximum shared memory size.
    *   Process: Dynamically allocate shared memory blocks to each partition.  Block size is determined by the complexity of the partition (number of nodes, texture size, shader complexity). If a partition exceeds the maximum shared memory size, it is subdivided further.
    *   Output: A mapping between partition ID and allocated shared memory block address.

3.  **Parallel Rendering Engine:**
    *   Input: Partitioned scene graph, partition ID, shared memory block address.
    *   Process: Distribute rendering tasks across multiple cores/threads. Each thread is assigned one or more partitions to render. Each thread renders its assigned partitions directly into its allocated shared memory block.
    *   Output: Rendered data within the shared memory blocks.

4.  **Compositing Engine:**
    *   Input: Shared memory blocks, camera information, lighting information.
    *   Process: Composite the rendered data from the shared memory blocks into a final rendered image. Utilize a multi-pass compositing approach to handle transparency and blending.
    *   Output: Final rendered image.

**Pseudocode (Compositing Engine - simplified):**

```
function CompositeImage(sharedMemoryBlocks, cameraInfo, lightingInfo):
  finalImage = new Image()
  for each block in sharedMemoryBlocks:
    blockID = block.ID
    # Retrieve block's render data from shared memory
    renderData = GetRenderData(block)
    # Apply post-processing effects (lighting, shadows) to renderData
    processedData = ApplyEffects(renderData, cameraInfo, lightingInfo)
    # Blend processedData with finalImage
    finalImage = Blend(finalImage, processedData, blockID)
  return finalImage
```

**Innovations:**

*   **Predictive Partitioning:**  Rather than isolating individual nodes, this approach proactively divides the entire scene based on visibility, maximizing parallelization potential.
*   **Dynamic Memory Allocation:**  Allows the system to adapt to varying scene complexity and available resources.
*   **Reduced Data Transfer:** Minimizes data movement between CPU and GPU by rendering directly into shared memory.
*   **Scalability:**  Well-suited for complex scenes and high-resolution rendering.
