## Adaptive Sensory Substitution Layer

**Concept:** Expand the content modification capabilities beyond visual & auditory suppression/replacement to encompass *all* sensory inputs, utilizing a dynamically configurable "sensory substitution layer."  Instead of just obscuring or changing what's *presented*, actively *translate* suppressed content into alternative sensory experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**  Requires multi-modal input/output capabilities.  Assume device has:
    *   High-resolution display.
    *   Spatial audio output (headphones/speakers).
    *   Haptic feedback system (vibration motors, potentially more advanced tactile displays).
    *   Microphone array for ambient sound analysis.
    *   Camera for visual scene analysis.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **Sensory Input Analyzer:**  Processes incoming content (video, audio, text, etc.). Identifies segments designated for suppression based on user preferences and content selection tags (as defined in the base patent).
    *   **Sensory Translation Engine:** The core innovation.  Maps suppressed content features to alternative sensory representations.  This is driven by user-defined profiles or AI-generated mappings.  Example mappings:
        *   Suppressed visual object ->  Distinct haptic pattern.  (A car being removed from a scene is signaled by a specific vibration sequence on the user's wrist).
        *   Suppressed audio frequency ->  Change in ambient lighting color. (A specific musical note being removed is signaled by a shift in room lighting).
        *   Suppressed text phrase ->  Spatial audio cue indicating direction/distance of “removed” information.
    *   **Sensory Output Manager:**  Controls the output of translated sensory information through the device's hardware.  Ensures seamless integration with the remaining presented content.
    *   **User Preference Manager:** Allows users to:
        *   Define custom sensory mappings for different content types and suppression tags.
        *   Adjust the intensity and characteristics of translated sensory outputs.
        *   Create profiles for different scenarios (e.g., “focus mode” for work, “relaxation mode” for leisure).
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `SuppressionTag`:  (Existing from base patent) – Identifies content to suppress.
    *   `SensoryMapping`:
        *   `SourceSensoryType`: (Visual, Audio, Text, etc.)
        *   `TargetSensoryType`: (Haptic, Visual, Audio, etc.)
        *   `MappingFunction`:  (Algorithm to translate source content to target sensory representation). Can be a pre-defined function or a user-defined script.
        *   `Intensity`:  Scale of 0-1 for output signal strength.
*   **Pseudocode (Example: Suppressing a visual object and mapping to haptic feedback):**

```
function processContent(content, suppressionTags, sensoryMappings):
  for each segment in content:
    if segment has suppressionTag:
      mapping = findSensoryMapping(suppressionTag, sensoryMappings)
      if mapping exists:
        hapticPattern = applyMappingFunction(segment, mapping)
        outputHapticFeedback(hapticPattern, intensity = mapping.intensity)
      else:
        // Default:  Hide/obscure segment visually
        hideSegment(segment)
    else:
      // Present segment normally
      presentSegment(segment)
```

*   **Novelty:** Goes beyond simple suppression/replacement to *active translation* of suppressed content, enabling users to remain aware of removed information through alternative sensory channels. This could be particularly useful for users with sensory impairments, or for creating more immersive and personalized content experiences.  It moves past simply ‘not showing’ something to letting the user *know* it was there in another manner.
*   **Potential Applications:** Assistive technology, accessibility, immersive entertainment, personalized content filtering, augmented reality.
