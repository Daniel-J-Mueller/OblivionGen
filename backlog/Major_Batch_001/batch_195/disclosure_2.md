## Adaptive Skill-Based Queuing with Predictive Routing

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple expertise matching to dynamically adjust agent skill requirements *during* a contact, and proactively route based on predicted agent availability *and* predicted contact complexity.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Real-time Skill Assessment Module:** Continuously analyzes the ongoing conversation (speech-to-text, sentiment analysis, topic modeling) to determine the *evolving* skills needed for resolution. This isn't a static skill profile; it’s a dynamic one.
*   **Predictive Agent Availability Engine:**  Uses historical data (call volume, agent speed, break times) *combined* with real-time monitoring of agent workload (number of active chats/calls, average handle time) to predict agent availability *with a confidence score*.
*   **Contact Complexity Estimator:**  Employs machine learning to estimate the *remaining* effort required to resolve the contact based on the conversation history, identified issues, and customer sentiment. This generates a ‘resolution effort score’.
*   **Dynamic Queue Adjustment:**  Modifies agent skill requirements in the queue *during* the contact. If the complexity increases and requires a different skillset, the queue filters adjust automatically.
*   **Proactive Routing Logic:** Routes the contact to the agent best suited *not just* based on current skills, but on the combination of: predicted availability, resolution effort score, and queue-adjusted skill requirements.

**II. Data Flow & Pseudocode:**

1.  **Initial Contact:** Contact enters the queue with an initial skill requirement profile.
2.  **Real-Time Analysis (Loop):**
    *   **Conversation Data → Real-Time Skill Assessment Module:** Extracts keywords, sentiment, and topic.
    *   **Skill Assessment → Updated Skill Profile:**  Modifies the initial profile with evolving requirements. (e.g. “Basic Troubleshooting” → “Advanced Network Configuration”).
    *   **Conversation Data → Contact Complexity Estimator:** Calculates a ‘Resolution Effort Score’ (1-10, 1 being easiest).
3.  **Agent Availability Prediction:**
    *   Historical Data + Real-Time Monitoring → Predicted Availability Score (0-100, 100 being highly available).
4.  **Routing Decision:**
    *   `Best Agent = Agent with MAX(Predicted Availability Score * (1 - (Resolution Effort Score / 10)) * Skill Match Score)`
        *   `Skill Match Score` is a weighted score based on how well the agent's skills match the *updated* skill profile.
5.  **Queue Adjustment:** The queue dynamically adjusts to prioritize agents matching the updated profile.
6.  **Contact Routing:** The contact is routed to the “Best Agent”.

**III. UI/UX Considerations:**

*   **Agent Interface:** Display the “Resolution Effort Score” and the *reason* the contact was routed to them.
*   **Supervisor Dashboard:** Visualize the dynamic queue adjustments and the “Best Agent” selection process.
*   **Customer Experience:** Minimal impact. The system operates behind the scenes to optimize routing.

**IV. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Gamification:** Reward agents who successfully handle high-complexity contacts.
*   **Predictive Escalation:**  Identify contacts that are likely to require escalation and proactively route them to senior agents.
*   **Integration with Knowledge Base:** Automatically suggest relevant knowledge base articles based on the evolving skill requirements.
