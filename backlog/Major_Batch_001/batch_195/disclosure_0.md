## Encrypted Data Sharding & Dynamic Key Rotation

**Concept:** Expand upon the concept of delivering encrypted data without intermediate decryption by introducing data sharding *before* encryption and rotating the encryption keys dynamically based on shard access patterns. This adds a layer of resilience against compromise and allows for granular access control.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Preparation & Sharding Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw data stream.
*   **Process:**
    *   Divide the data stream into fixed-size or variable-size shards (e.g., 1MB, 5MB, or determined by content type/sensitivity).
    *   Assign a unique shard ID to each shard.
    *   Metadata generation:  Record shard ID, original data type, and any associated access control lists (ACLs) or data lineage information.
*   **Output:** Collection of data shards and metadata.

**2. Dynamic Key Management Service (DKMS):**

*   **Function:** Generate, store, and rotate encryption keys on a per-shard basis.
*   **Key Generation:** Employ a key derivation function (KDF) seeded with a master key and the shard ID. This ensures each shard has a unique key.
*   **Key Rotation:** Monitor shard access patterns. If a shard is accessed frequently, DKMS automatically rotates the encryption key. Rotation frequency is configurable.  Old keys are archived for a predefined period.
*   **API:**
    *   `GetKey(shardID)`: Returns the current encryption key for a given shard.
    *   `RotateKey(shardID)`: Rotates the key for a given shard and invalidates the old key.
    *   `ArchiveKey(shardID, keyVersion)`: Archives an old key version.

**3. Secure Transmission Module:**

*   **Input:** Data shards, shard IDs, DKMS API.
*   **Process:**
    *   For each shard:
        *   Call `DKMS.GetKey(shardID)` to retrieve the current encryption key.
        *   Encrypt the shard using a symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-GCM).
        *   Package the encrypted shard, shard ID, and a digital signature (using a key associated with the sender).
    *   Transmit the encrypted shard packages to the receiver.

**4. Secure Reception & Reassembly Module:**

*   **Input:** Encrypted shard packages.
*   **Process:**
    *   Verify the digital signature of each package.
    *   Extract the shard ID and encrypted shard data.
    *   Call `DKMS.GetKey(shardID)` to retrieve the current encryption key.  (The receiver *must* have access to the DKMS or a synchronized key store).
    *   Decrypt the shard data.
    *   Reassemble the shards in the correct order (based on shard ID) to reconstruct the original data.

**Pseudocode (Secure Reception & Reassembly):**

```
function ReceiveAndReassemble(encryptedShards):
  reconstructedData = ""
  shards = SortShardsById(encryptedShards) // Sort by shard ID

  for shard in shards:
    signatureValid = VerifySignature(shard.signature, shard.senderPublicKey)
    if not signatureValid:
      Log("Signature verification failed for shard: " + shard.shardId)
      continue

    shardId = shard.shardId
    encryptedData = shard.encryptedData

    key = DKMS.GetKey(shardId)  // Retrieve key from DKMS

    decryptedData = Decrypt(encryptedData, key)  // Decrypt data

    reconstructedData += decryptedData

  return reconstructedData
```

**Considerations:**

*   **DKMS Access Control:** Strict access control is critical for the DKMS to prevent unauthorized key retrieval or rotation.
*   **Key Archival:** Securely archive old keys for compliance and potential data recovery.
*   **Shard Size:** Optimize shard size for performance and resilience. Smaller shards offer greater parallelism but may increase overhead.
*   **Network Reliability:** Implement mechanisms for handling lost or corrupted shard packages (e.g., retransmission, error correction codes).
*   **Metadata Security:** Protect the metadata associated with each shard to prevent tampering.
