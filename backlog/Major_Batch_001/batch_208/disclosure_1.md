## Dynamic Resource Shaping via Predictive Client Behavior

**Concept:** Leverage client device characteristics *and* predicted future behavior to proactively shape resource delivery, going beyond simple cluster-based routing. This isn’t just *where* to serve content, but *how* – modifying content format, resolution, or even functionality *before* the client fully requests it, based on predicted needs.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Prediction Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Client device type (OS, browser, screen resolution, CPU/GPU capabilities).
    *   Historical request patterns for the client (time of day, day of week, frequently accessed content types).
    *   Real-time network conditions (latency, bandwidth).
    *   Geo-location (for regional trends).
    *   Contextual data (e.g., if the client is connected to a known IoT device, like a smart TV or AR headset).
*   **Prediction Model:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained to predict the *type* of content the client will request *next*, the *resolution* they are likely to prefer, and the *tolerated latency*.  Training data will be anonymized request logs.
*   **Output:** A probability distribution of likely future requests, along with predicted quality of service (QoS) preferences.

**2. Resource Shaping Module:**

*   **Content Adaptation:**  Based on the predicted requests, pre-render or pre-encode multiple versions of potentially requested content:
    *   Different resolutions (e.g., 1080p, 720p, 360p).
    *   Different codecs (e.g., H.264, H.265, AV1).
    *   Different levels of detail (LOD) for 3D assets.
    *   Simplified versions of webpages (e.g., removing non-essential JavaScript).
*   **Functional Adaptation:** If the prediction suggests a low-bandwidth or low-power situation (e.g., mobile device on cellular network), proactively reduce the functionality of the delivered content:
    *   Disable animations.
    *   Reduce the number of concurrent connections.
    *   Load a simplified user interface.
*   **Pre-fetching:**  Based on the highest probability predicted request, pre-fetch the corresponding resource to the edge cache closest to the client.

**3. Dynamic Routing & Delivery:**

*   **Routing Algorithm:**  An extended version of the existing cluster-based routing, incorporating a “shaping score” based on the predicted client behavior.
    *   The shaping score prioritizes edge caches that already have the pre-fetched and pre-shaped resources.
*   **Delivery Protocol:** Utilize a hybrid approach:
    *   For high-probability, predictable requests, serve the pre-shaped content directly from the edge cache.
    *   For less predictable requests, fall back to the standard on-demand content delivery.
*   **Real-time Feedback Loop:** Monitor actual client behavior and adjust the prediction model and shaping algorithm accordingly.



**Pseudocode (simplified routing logic):**

```
function routeRequest(dnsQuery, clientInfo) {
  predictedRequest = predictNextRequest(clientInfo);
  shapingScore = calculateShapingScore(predictedRequest, edgeCaches);

  // existing cluster-based routing logic...

  // incorporate shaping score into the routing decision
  weightedScore = (clusterScore * weightCluster) + (shapingScore * weightShaping);

  select best edgeCache based on weightedScore
  return edgeCache;
}

function calculateShapingScore(predictedRequest, edgeCaches) {
  for each edgeCache {
    if edgeCache has pre-shaped content for predictedRequest {
      score = 100
    } else {
      score = 0
    }
    return score
  }
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Increased processing power and memory at edge cache nodes to handle pre-rendering and encoding.
*   Dedicated machine learning accelerators for running the prediction model.
