## Adaptive Index Partitioning with Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on throttling index creation based on a queue size. This design expands on that by dynamically partitioning the table and secondary index *during* indexing, and proactively balancing load across storage nodes based on predicted indexing workload. This moves beyond reactive throttling to proactive resource allocation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Table & Index Partitioning Module:**

*   **Function:** Responsible for initially partitioning the table and secondary index based on a hashing scheme (consistent hashing preferred) across available storage nodes.  This is done *before* indexing begins.
*   **Input:** Table schema, initial number of storage nodes, desired partition size (configurable).
*   **Output:** Partition map (node ID -> range of keys/hash values).
*   **Dynamic Re-Partitioning:** Monitors indexing progress and dynamically adjusts the partition map.  Re-partitioning is triggered by:
    *   **Skew Detection:** If one partition receives significantly more pending updates than others (configurable threshold).
    *   **Node Load Imbalance:** If one storage node's CPU/IO utilization exceeds a threshold while others are underutilized.
    *   **Node Addition/Removal:** Automatically re-partition when storage nodes are added or removed from the cluster.

**2. Workload Prediction Engine:**

*   **Function:** Predicts the indexing workload for each table partition.  This prediction informs the dynamic re-partitioning process.
*   **Input:**
    *   Table schema
    *   Data distribution (sampled from the table)
    *   Indexing workload characteristics (e.g., primary key range scans, point lookups).
    *   Historical indexing data (if available).
*   **Output:** Predicted indexing workload (estimated number of updates, estimated CPU/IO cost) for each partition.
*   **Prediction Methods:**
    *   **Statistical Modeling:**  Use statistical models (e.g., histograms, probability distributions) to estimate data distribution and workload.
    *   **Machine Learning:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., regression model, neural network) to predict workload based on historical data and table characteristics.

**3. Adaptive Load Balancer:**

*   **Function:** Distributes pending updates to the secondary index across storage nodes, taking into account both the current queue size *and* the predicted workload.
*   **Input:** Pending updates queue, predicted workload for each partition, current queue size on each storage node.
*   **Output:** Assignment of pending updates to storage nodes.
*   **Load Balancing Algorithm:**
    *   **Weighted Round Robin:** Assign updates to nodes in a round-robin fashion, but with weights based on predicted workload and current queue size. Nodes with lower workload and queue size receive more updates.
    *   **Least Loaded First:**  Assign updates to the node with the lowest combined workload and queue size.

**4.  Integration with Existing Queue:**

*   The existing queue of pending updates is *maintained*.  The Adaptive Load Balancer sits *in front* of the queue, determining *which* node receives an update before itâ€™s placed in the queue. The storage node responsible for that portion of the index then processes updates from its portion of the queue.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Load Balancer):**

```
function assign_update(update):
  partition_id = determine_partition(update.key)
  node_id = get_responsible_node(partition_id)

  // Calculate a score for each node based on workload and queue size
  score = (1 / predicted_workload[node_id]) + (1 / queue_size[node_id])

  //Assign update to the node with the highest score
  enqueue_update(node_id, update)

  return

function get_responsible_node(partition_id):
  //Look up node ID from Partition Map
  return node_id

```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   `initial_partition_count`: Number of initial table partitions.
*   `max_queue_size`: Maximum allowed queue size.
*   `workload_prediction_interval`: Frequency of workload prediction updates.
*   `repartitioning_threshold`: Skew/Imbalance threshold triggering re-partitioning.
*   `dynamic_partitioning_enabled`:  Toggle to enable/disable dynamic partitioning.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced indexing latency.
*   Improved resource utilization.
*   Increased scalability.
*   More resilient system.
