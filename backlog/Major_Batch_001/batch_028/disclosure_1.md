**Adaptive Bundle Prefetching Based on User Attention Metrics**

**Specification:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Client-Side Attention Tracker:** A JavaScript module integrated into web pages, measuring user attention via:
    *   **Scroll Depth:** Percentage of page scrolled.
    *   **Time Spent on Section:** Duration user’s viewport focuses on specific content sections.
    *   **Mouse/Touch Interactions:** Frequency and location of clicks, taps, and hover events.
    *   **Eye Tracking (Optional):** If hardware/browser support exists, integrate eye-tracking data.
*   **Attention Data Aggregator:** Server-side component receiving attention metrics from multiple clients.  Uses anonymized user identifiers for aggregation.
*   **Predictive Bundle Generator:** Server-side component utilizing machine learning models.  These models predict which content items (images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.) will *likely* be needed based on aggregated attention data.
*   **Bundle Delivery Network (BDN):**  A CDN optimized for delivering small, frequently updated bundles.
*   **Client-Side Bundle Manager:** JavaScript module responsible for receiving, caching, and utilizing pre-fetched bundles.

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Page Load:** Browser requests the base HTML document.
2.  **Attention Tracking Initialization:** Client-Side Attention Tracker initializes, capturing user attention metrics.
3.  **Data Transmission:**  Attention data is periodically (e.g., every 5 seconds) transmitted to the Attention Data Aggregator.  Transmission is throttled to minimize bandwidth impact.
4.  **Predictive Bundle Generation:** The Attention Data Aggregator feeds aggregated attention data to the Predictive Bundle Generator. The Generator uses this data to forecast content needs for similar pages/user segments.  
    *   **Model Training:**  The machine learning model is continuously trained on historical attention data and content consumption patterns.  Algorithms include:
        *   **Collaborative Filtering:**  Identifies content preferences based on users with similar attention patterns.
        *   **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends content based on features of previously viewed content.
        *   **Reinforcement Learning:**  Optimizes bundle composition based on user engagement metrics (e.g., time on page, bounce rate).
5.  **Bundle Creation & Delivery:** The Predictive Bundle Generator creates optimized content bundles. Bundles are versioned.  The BDN delivers bundles to the client.
6.  **Client-Side Bundle Management:**
    *   The Client-Side Bundle Manager receives bundle manifest data.
    *   It checks if the received bundle is a newer version than the currently cached one.
    *   If a new version is available, it downloads and caches the bundle.
    *   When the browser encounters a content item referenced in the bundle, it first checks the local cache. If the item is present, it's loaded immediately, avoiding a network request.
7.  **Dynamic Bundle Adjustment:**
    *   Client-side attention data is used to refine the predictive model in real-time.
    *   If a user deviates from expected attention patterns (e.g., quickly scrolls past a section), the Client-Side Bundle Manager can request a smaller, more focused bundle.

**3. Pseudocode (Client-Side Bundle Manager):**

```
function onPageLoad() {
  initializeAttentionTracker();
  requestInitialBundle();
}

function requestInitialBundle() {
  // Send request to server for initial bundle version
  server.getBundleVersion(pageURL, function(bundleVersion) {
    if (cachedBundleVersion != bundleVersion) {
      downloadBundle(bundleVersion);
    }
  });
}

function downloadBundle(bundleVersion) {
  server.getBundleContent(bundleVersion, function(bundleContent) {
    cacheBundle(bundleContent);
    cachedBundleVersion = bundleVersion;
  });
}

function checkCache(contentURL) {
  if (cachedBundle.contains(contentURL)) {
    return cachedBundle.get(contentURL);
  } else {
    // Initiate normal content request
    return null;
  }
}

function reportAttentionData() {
  // Collect attention metrics
  attentionData = {
    scrollDepth: getScrollDepth(),
    timeOnSection: getTimeOnSection(),
    interactions: getInteractions()
  };
  // Send attention data to server
  server.reportAttentionData(attentionData);
}
```

**4.  Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:**  Anonymization of user data is critical.  Consider differential privacy techniques.
*   **Bandwidth Impact:**  Minimize bundle size and transmission frequency.
*   **Cache Invalidation:**  Implement a robust cache invalidation strategy to ensure users receive updated content.
*   **Scalability:**  The system must be able to handle a large number of concurrent users.
*   **Content Diversity:** Algorithm should allow content diversity to avoid the “filter bubble” effect.
