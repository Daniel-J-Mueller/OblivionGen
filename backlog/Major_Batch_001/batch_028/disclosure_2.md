## Predictive Prefetching with User Intent Vectors

**System Overview:** This system builds upon the idea of dynamically selecting optimal servers, but expands it to proactively prefetch content *before* the user explicitly requests it. It does this by building a ‘User Intent Vector’ derived from real-time browsing behavior and predicting the likely next content requests.

**Core Components:**

*   **User Intent Vector (UIV):** A dynamically updated vector representing the user’s likely future content requests. Dimensions of the vector include:
    *   **Content Type:** (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript, video, text) – weighted based on recent requests.
    *   **Domain/Source:** (e.g., specific websites or CDNs) – weighted based on recent requests.
    *   **Content Category:** (e.g., news, social media, shopping) – determined via content analysis and weighted.
    *   **Temporal Patterns:** Time of day, day of week – reflecting typical usage patterns.
    *   **Scroll Depth & Dwell Time:** Indicates user interest in specific content sections.
*   **Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model trained to predict the next content request based on the UIV. This could be a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a transformer model.
*   **Prefetching Manager:** Responsible for initiating prefetch requests to the optimal server (determined using the round trip latency logic described in the source patent).
*   **Cache Prioritization:** Prefetched content is given a higher priority in the browser cache, ensuring fast delivery when the user eventually requests it.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Real-time Data Collection:** The browser continuously collects data on the user’s browsing behavior (page visits, content types, scroll depth, dwell time, etc.).
2.  **UIV Update:** The collected data is used to update the UIV in real-time.
3.  **Prediction:** The Prediction Engine uses the UIV to predict the next content request.  It outputs a probability distribution over potential content requests.
4.  **Prefetch Initiation:**  The Prefetching Manager initiates prefetch requests for the top N most likely content requests, based on the probability distribution. It utilizes the existing server selection logic to choose the optimal server for each request.
5.  **Cache Storage:** Prefetched content is stored in the browser cache with a high priority.
6.  **Content Delivery:** When the user actually requests the content, it is served directly from the cache if available, resulting in a faster load time.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Manager):**

```
function prefetch_content(user_intent_vector):
  predictions = prediction_engine.predict(user_intent_vector) // Returns list of (content_url, probability)
  top_n_predictions = predictions[:5] // Prefetch top 5 most likely items

  for content_url, probability in top_n_predictions:
    optimal_server = select_optimal_server(content_url) // Uses RTT logic from source patent

    prefetch_request = create_prefetch_request(content_url, optimal_server)
    send_prefetch_request(prefetch_request)
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Privacy Considerations:**  User data used to build the UIV should be anonymized and aggregated to protect user privacy.
*   **Bandwidth Management:**  The prefetching system should be throttled to prevent excessive bandwidth usage.
*   **Accuracy Monitoring:** The accuracy of the Prediction Engine should be monitored and retrained periodically to improve performance.
*   **Server Support:**  Servers should support prefetch requests (e.g., via HTTP/2 PUSH or a custom prefetch API).
