## Dynamic Multipath Group Swarming

**Concept:** Instead of pre-defined multipath groups and static re-association, implement a system where paths dynamically *swarm* around congestion points. This leverages a continuous assessment of path quality, not just congestion detection, and allows for granular, real-time path selection beyond simply switching between two groups.

**Specs:**

*   **Path Quality Metric:** Define a composite “Path Quality” score based on:
    *   Latency (measured RTT)
    *   Packet Loss (measured via ECN/DSCP markings or explicit ACK/NAK)
    *   Interface Utilization (current load on the interface)
    *   Historical Performance (weighted average of past metrics)

*   **Path Probes:** Implement periodic “Path Probes” - small, low-priority packets sent across all potential paths to continuously update Path Quality scores. Probes are designed to minimize impact on normal traffic.

*   **Distributed Path Quality Database:** Maintain a distributed database of Path Quality scores across network devices. This database is updated by Path Probes and used for real-time path selection. Devices share data using a gossip protocol (e.g., consistent hashing or similar).

*   **Swarm Algorithm:**
    1.  When congestion is detected on a given interface (as in the original patent), *don’t* simply switch to another pre-defined group.
    2.  Identify *all* available paths to the destination.
    3.  Rank paths based on Path Quality scores.
    4.  Dynamically create a “Swarm” of paths: The top N paths are selected, with the number N determined by available bandwidth and destination requirements.
    5.  Distribute traffic across the Swarm using a weighted distribution algorithm (e.g., weighted round robin) based on Path Quality. Higher quality paths receive more traffic.
    6.  Continuously monitor Path Quality within the Swarm. If a path degrades, reduce its weight or remove it. Add new, high-quality paths as they become available.

*   **Virtual Queues & Packet Steering:** Implement per-path virtual queues. Packet steering logic directs packets to the appropriate virtual queue based on flow characteristics (e.g., 5-tuple) and the current Swarm configuration.

*   **Flow-Aware Swarming:** Extend the system to be flow-aware. Different flows can have different Swarm configurations based on their requirements (e.g., latency-sensitive flows prioritize low-latency paths).

*   **Congestion Prediction:** Implement machine learning algorithms to predict congestion based on historical data and current network conditions. This allows for proactive Swarm adjustments before congestion occurs.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Packet Steering):**

```
function steerPacket(packet, flowInfo):
  swarm = getSwarm(destination, flowInfo) // Retrieves current Swarm for the destination & flow
  path = selectPath(swarm) // Selects a path from the Swarm (e.g., weighted random)
  queue = getVirtualQueue(path)
  enqueue(queue, packet)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased memory requirements for virtual queues.
*   Potential need for faster packet processing capabilities to support dynamic path selection.
*   Leverage existing hardware acceleration features for queue management and packet steering.

This approach moves beyond static multipath groups and creates a more adaptive and resilient network by dynamically adjusting to changing conditions in real-time. It is computationally expensive but can significantly improve network performance and reliability.
