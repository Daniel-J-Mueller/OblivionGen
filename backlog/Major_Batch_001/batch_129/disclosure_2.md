## Delegated Resource Orchestration via Temporal Access Keys

**Concept:** Expand delegated permissions beyond static access rights to incorporate *temporal* access, allowing permissions to automatically expire or change based on pre-defined schedules or triggering events. This moves beyond simple ‘who can do what’ to ‘who can do what, when, and under what conditions’.

**Specifications:**

**1. Temporal Key Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Delegation Profile (as defined in the patent), User Credential, Time-to-Live (TTL) – expressed in duration or specific timestamps, Event Triggers (e.g., completion of a task, data modification, external system signal).
*   **Process:**
    *   Generate a unique, cryptographically signed Temporal Access Key (TAK). The TAK encapsulates the original access rights *and* the temporal parameters (TTL, event triggers).
    *   The signing process incorporates hashing of the Delegation Profile, User Credential, and temporal parameters to ensure integrity.
    *   The TAK will be structured to include metadata indicating the originating Delegation Profile ID and User ID for auditing/revocation purposes.
*   **Output:** Encrypted TAK.

**2. Resource Access Gateway:**

*   **Input:** Resource Request, TAK.
*   **Process:**
    *   Decrypt and validate the TAK:
        *   Verify cryptographic signature.
        *   Check TAK validity period (TTL) – reject if expired.
        *   Evaluate event triggers – if the triggering event has *not* occurred, reject the request.
    *   If the TAK is valid, authorize access to the requested resource based on the permissions encoded within the TAK (inherited from the Delegation Profile).
*   **Output:** Resource Access Granted/Denied.

**3. Event Monitoring Service:**

*   **Input:** System Events (e.g., task completion, data modifications, external system signals).
*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor for events relevant to active TAKs.
    *   Upon event occurrence, update the status of associated TAKs (e.g., marking as triggered, unlocking new permissions).
    *   Publish event notifications to the Resource Access Gateway.

**4. Revocation Mechanism:**

*   **Process:**  Administrators can revoke TAKs or Delegation Profiles. Revocation invalidates all associated TAKs immediately.
*   **Implementation:** A centralized revocation list maintained by the Resource Access Gateway. TAKs are checked against this list upon access requests.

**Pseudocode (Resource Access Gateway - Access Check):**

```
FUNCTION CheckAccess(request, TAK):
  TRY:
    DECRYPT TAK
    VERIFY Signature(TAK)
    IF IsExpired(TAK):
      RETURN Denied
    IF EventNotTriggered(TAK):
      RETURN Denied
    IF TAK in RevocationList:
      RETURN Denied
    RETURN Authorize(request, TAK.Permissions)
  CATCH Exception:
    RETURN Denied
```

**Novelty:** This extends the concept of delegated permissions by introducing *time* and *events* as critical authorization factors. It is not simply 'who can do what' but 'who can do what, when, and if'. This allows for much finer-grained control and automation of resource access, particularly in dynamic or sensitive environments.  The Event Monitoring Service and the associated TAK structure are novel components, allowing for access rights to change automatically based on external conditions.
