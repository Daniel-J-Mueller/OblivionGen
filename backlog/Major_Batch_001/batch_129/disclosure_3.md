## Dynamic Contextual Sandboxing with AI-Driven Policy Enforcement

**Concept:** Extend the existing sandboxing concept to be *dynamic* and driven by AI policy enforcement, allowing for granular control over resource access based on observed test behavior *during* execution. Instead of pre-defined security contexts, the system creates and adjusts sandboxes on-the-fly.

**Specification:**

1.  **Behavioral Analysis Module:**
    *   **Input:** Real-time stream of test code execution, including API calls, network requests, and data access patterns.
    *   **Process:** Employ a lightweight AI model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or transformer) trained to identify potentially malicious or unintended behavior within the test context. This isn’t about identifying 'malware,' but flagging deviations from *expected* test workflows.
    *   **Output:** A 'risk score' and a set of 'behavioral tags' describing the observed test actions.  Tags might include: `network_access`, `file_write`, `dom_mutation`, `external_api_call`, `sensitive_data_access`, etc.

2.  **Dynamic Sandbox Manager:**
    *   **Input:** Risk score, behavioral tags, and current sandbox configuration.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Maintain a pool of pre-configured sandbox templates with varying levels of restriction (e.g., 'low', 'medium', 'high').
        *   Based on the risk score and behavioral tags, dynamically select or create a sandbox configuration.
        *   Implement 'sandbox hopping':  If the risk score exceeds a threshold, automatically migrate the test execution to a more restrictive sandbox.
        *   Enable ‘granular permissioning’:  Instead of entire sandboxes, apply permissions on a per-API-call or per-resource-access basis.  For example, block network access to specific domains, or restrict file writing to a temporary directory.
    *   **Output:** Updated sandbox configuration and enforcement policies.

3.  **Policy Enforcement Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Test code execution, current sandbox configuration, and enforcement policies.
    *   **Process:** Intercept all critical API calls (network, file I/O, DOM manipulation, etc.) and evaluate them against the current sandbox policies.  Block or redirect any calls that violate the policies.
    *   **Output:**  Control signals to the test execution environment (allow/block).

4.  **Adaptive Learning Loop:**
    *   **Process:** Collect data on test execution (risk scores, policy violations, successful/failed tests).  Use this data to retrain the AI model and refine the sandbox policies.  The system learns from its mistakes and improves its ability to predict and prevent security issues.
    *   **Data Storage:** Log all relevant events to a secure audit trail.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Inside Test Execution Loop:

risk_score, behavioral_tags = behavioral_analysis_module(current_test_action)

sandbox_config = dynamic_sandbox_manager(risk_score, behavioral_tags)

allowed = policy_enforcement_engine(current_test_action, sandbox_config)

if allowed:
  execute_test_action()
else:
  log_violation()
  // Optionally:  Terminate test or take corrective action
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond static sandboxing to a *proactive* and *adaptive* security model.  The AI-driven policy enforcement engine learns from test behavior and dynamically adjusts the security context to minimize risk. The granularity of permissioning allows for more precise control over resource access. This is a significant enhancement to the existing security framework, offering a more robust and flexible solution for testing heterogeneous client environments.
