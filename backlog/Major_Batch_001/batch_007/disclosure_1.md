## Dynamic DOM Script Injection with Behavioral Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the existing system to not just *apply* DOM transformations, but to *learn* user behavior through those transformations and proactively inject scripts designed to enhance or alter the user experience *before* a full page load, based on predicted needs.

**Specs:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection Module:**

*   **Data Points:** Track user interactions *after* a transformation is applied. Key metrics: time spent on altered elements, click-through rates, scroll depth, form completion rates, error rates (JS errors introduced by transformation).
*   **Profiling:**  Develop user profiles based on collected data. Categorize users (e.g., ‘power user’, ‘casual browser’, ‘task-oriented’). Profiles are assigned a ‘Behavioral Signature’ – a vector representing the weightings of different behavioral data points.
*   **Signature Storage:**  Store Behavioral Signatures associated with user identifiers (session, account). This will require a scalable data store optimized for vector similarity searches.

**2. Predictive Script Injection Module:**

*   **Script Catalog:** Maintain a catalog of small, focused JavaScript scripts designed to address common user needs *before* page load. Scripts are tagged with 'Behavioral Signature Matches' – indicating which user profiles they are most likely to benefit. Examples:
    *   ‘Accessibility Enhancer’ – injects ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation improvements.
    *   ‘Performance Optimizer’ – preloads critical resources identified for the user’s likely browsing pattern.
    *   ‘Form Auto-Filler’ – pre-populates form fields based on user history.
    *   'Content Summarizer' - injects a simplified summary of a long-form article.
*   **Pre-Load Logic:**  When a user requests a page:
    1.  Retrieve the user's Behavioral Signature.
    2.  Query the Script Catalog for scripts with high signature matches.
    3.  Inject the selected scripts *into the initial HTML response* – before the main page content. These scripts run *before* the DOM is fully parsed, allowing for pre-emptive modifications.
*   **Adaptive Script Selection:** Continuously refine script selection based on user feedback (e.g., if a script consistently causes errors or is ignored, its weighting is reduced).

**3. Transformation Code Integration:**

*   The existing transformation code remains responsible for modifying the DOM *after* the initial load.
*   The predictive scripts and transformations should work in harmony – the scripts preparing the stage, and the transformations fine-tuning the final presentation.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Pre-Load Logic):**

```
function preloadScripts(userIdentifier, htmlResponse):
  userSignature = getUserSignature(userIdentifier)
  matchingScripts = queryScriptCatalog(userSignature) // returns a list of script URLs
  
  for scriptURL in matchingScripts:
    scriptTag = createScriptTag(scriptURL)
    injectScriptTag(scriptTag, htmlResponse) // inject before </body>
  
  return modifiedHtmlResponse
```

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   Caching: Aggressively cache frequently used scripts and Behavioral Signatures.
*   CDN: Distribute scripts via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for low latency.
*   Asynchronous Script Loading: Load scripts asynchronously to avoid blocking page rendering.
*   Data Partitioning: Partition Behavioral Signature data for improved query performance.
