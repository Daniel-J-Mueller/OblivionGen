## Dynamic Biofeedback-Driven Media Recommendation

**Concept:** Extend the BPM-based recommendation system to incorporate real-time physiological data from the user to personalize recommendations beyond musical tempo, encompassing emotional and arousal states.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Sensor Integration:**
    *   Support integration with wearable biosensors (heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), EEG) via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi.
    *   Establish secure API for data ingestion and processing.
    *   Support multiple sensor models and configurations.

2.  **Real-time Data Processing:**
    *   Implement signal processing algorithms to extract relevant features from sensor data:
        *   HRV: RMSSD, SDNN, LF/HF ratio (stress/relaxation indicator)
        *   EDA: Mean, variance, number of peaks (arousal level)
        *   EEG: Alpha/Theta band power (relaxation, meditation states)
    *   Implement noise reduction and artifact removal techniques.
    *   Establish baseline calibration period for each user to account for individual physiological variations.

3.  **Emotional/Arousal State Classification:**
    *   Develop machine learning models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Neural Networks) to classify user’s emotional state (e.g., calm, excited, anxious, focused) and arousal level (low, medium, high) based on processed sensor data.
    *   Continuous updating of classification models with new data.

4.  **Enhanced Media Metadata:**
    *   Expand media metadata to include:
        *   “Emotional Valence” (positive, negative, neutral)
        *   “Arousal Level” (low, medium, high)
        *   “Cognitive Load” (low, medium, high) – potential for analysis of lyrical complexity or musical structure.
        *   These values could be determined through automated analysis or human curation.

5.  **Recommendation Algorithm Modification:**
    *   Integrate emotional/arousal state into the existing BPM-based recommendation algorithm.
    *   Recommendation score calculation:
        `Score = (BPM_Match_Weight * BPM_Similarity) + (Emotion_Match_Weight * Emotion_Similarity) + (Arousal_Match_Weight * Arousal_Similarity)`
        *   Weights are user-adjustable preferences.
        *   BPM Similarity:  Proximity of media BPM to user’s current activity BPM (or playlist BPM).
        *   Emotion Similarity:  Alignment of media emotional valence with user’s current emotional state.
        *   Arousal Similarity: Alignment of media arousal level with user’s current arousal level.
    *   Contextual Awareness: Consider time of day, location, and user activity (e.g., running, working, relaxing) when calculating scores.

6.  **User Interface Adaptations:**
    *   Display real-time physiological data (optional – user privacy control).
    *   Provide controls for adjusting recommendation weights.
    *   Implement feedback mechanisms for users to rate recommendations based on their emotional/physiological experience.

7.  **Data Storage & Privacy:**
    *   Secure storage of physiological data with user consent.
    *   Data anonymization and aggregation options.
    *   Compliance with relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function recommend_media(user, playlist, sensors):
    user_bpm = calculate_bpm(playlist)
    user_emotion, user_arousal = analyze_sensors(sensors)

    candidate_media = search_media(user_query)

    for media in candidate_media:
        media_bpm = media.bpm
        media_emotion = media.emotion
        media_arousal = media.arousal

        bpm_similarity = calculate_similarity(user_bpm, media_bpm)
        emotion_similarity = calculate_similarity(user_emotion, media_emotion)
        arousal_similarity = calculate_similarity(user_arousal, media_arousal)

        score = (BPM_Weight * bpm_similarity) + (Emotion_Weight * emotion_similarity) + (Arousal_Weight * arousal_similarity)
        media.score = score

    recommended_media = sort_media_by_score(candidate_media)
    return recommended_media
