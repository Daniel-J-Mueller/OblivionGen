## Decentralized Device Mesh & Dynamic Role Assignment

**Concept:** Extend the 'headless device' configuration and registration framework into a fully decentralized, self-organizing mesh network where device roles aren't fixed, but dynamically assigned based on real-time capabilities and network needs. Think beyond simple configuration, to an ecosystem where devices *become* access points, data aggregators, or processing nodes on-the-fly.

**Specs:**

*   **Network Topology:** Ad-hoc mesh network utilizing a modified version of 802.11s (or similar mesh protocol), but with a focus on lightweight, UDP-based communication for control signals and JSON-formatted data payloads.
*   **Device Classification:** Devices report their capabilities (processing power, memory, sensor types, bandwidth) via a standardized JSON schema upon network join. This schema is extensible to allow for future capability additions.
*   **Role Assignment Algorithm:** A distributed consensus algorithm (RAFT, Paxos, or similar) manages device roles. This algorithm considers:
    *   **Demand:** Network needs (e.g., more access points, data aggregation points).
    *   **Capacity:** Available resources on each device.
    *   **Proximity:**  Devices closer to the edge of the network are favored for access point roles.
    *   **Energy Status:** Low-energy devices are prioritized for passive roles.
*   **Dynamic Access Point Creation:** Any device can *become* an access point on demand, even if its primary function is different (e.g., a sensor node). The configuration is pushed via the secure channel established during initial registration.
*   **Data Aggregation & Edge Processing:**  Devices designated as aggregators receive data from surrounding nodes, perform basic processing (filtering, compression, anomaly detection), and forward the results to a central server (or other designated aggregator).
*   **Secure Communication:** All communication within the mesh is encrypted using a lightweight, authenticated encryption protocol (e.g., ChaCha20-Poly1305).
*   **Device Discovery:**  Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons used for initial device discovery and connection establishment before transitioning to the mesh network.
*   **UI Integration:** The existing web application (from the patent) is extended to visualize the mesh network topology, device roles, and data flow. Users can manually override role assignments or set priority preferences.

**Pseudocode (Role Assignment Algorithm):**

```
// Device Role Assignment Algorithm (Simplified)

function assignRoles(networkState, demand):
  // networkState: JSON containing device capabilities & current roles
  // demand: JSON describing network needs (e.g., numAccessPoints, dataRate)

  availableDevices = filter(networkState.devices, device -> device.role == 'available')
  
  //Prioritize devices based on criteria.
  rankedDevices = sort(availableDevices, criteria: [proximity, energyLevel, processingPower])

  for role in demand:
    numNeeded = demand[role]
    assignedCount = 0

    for device in rankedDevices:
        if assignedCount < numNeeded:
            device.role = role
            assignedCount++

  return networkState
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Low-power microcontrollers with Wi-Fi/Bluetooth capabilities (ESP32, Nordic nRF52 series).
*   Small form-factor antennas for mesh networking.
*   Energy harvesting capabilities (solar, vibration) to extend device lifespan.
