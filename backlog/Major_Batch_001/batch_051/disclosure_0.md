## Dynamic Network Slice Allocation via Predictive Mobility & Reputation

**Concept:** Extend the cooperative network concept by introducing dynamically allocated network "slices" – dedicated bandwidth & priority channels – not just based on usage *after* a transfer begins, but *predicted* based on user movement patterns, device reputation, and anticipated data needs. This moves beyond simple reciprocal data transfer towards a more intelligent, QoS-driven system.

**Specs:**

**1. Mobility Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time location data (GPS, WiFi triangulation, Bluetooth beacons) from user devices participating in the network. Historical movement data stored per user account. Device-reported "intent" (e.g., "navigating to work", "streaming video", "video conferencing").
*   **Processing:** Kalman filtering & Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to predict short-term (5-15 minute) travel paths and anticipated network usage at future locations. HMMs would be trained on historical data per user/device type.
*   **Output:** Predicted path (series of GPS coordinates + timestamp), anticipated bandwidth requirement (Kbps/Mbps), predicted QoS needs (latency, jitter, packet loss).  Confidence score for prediction.

**2. Reputation & Trust System:**

*   **Data Points:**
    *   **Data Contribution:** Amount of bandwidth a user has contributed to the network.
    *   **Data Accuracy:** Reports of successful/failed data transfers.  Self-reported data quality (e.g., "streaming at 1080p").
    *   **Network Compliance:**  Adherence to network protocols, avoidance of malicious behavior.
    *   **Peer Reviews:** Users can rate the quality of connections provided by other participants.
*   **Calculation:**  Bayesian average to combine these data points into a single reputation score.  Decay function to reduce the influence of old data.
*   **Output:** Reputation score (0-100), Trust Level (Low, Medium, High).  Flags for suspicious activity.

**3. Dynamic Slice Allocation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Predicted path + bandwidth requirements (from Mobility Prediction Module), Reputation score + Trust Level (from Reputation System), Available network resources (bandwidth, latency) at access points along the predicted path.  Existing slice allocations.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Resource Auction:**  A rolling auction for network slices.  Bids are based on predicted bandwidth needs *multiplied by* the user’s reputation score.  Higher reputation = higher priority.
    *   **Slice Creation/Adjustment:** Based on auction results, dynamically create/adjust network slices at access points along the predicted path.  Slices are defined by:
        *   Frequency band (e.g., 5 GHz, 60 GHz)
        *   Channel width
        *   Priority level (QoS settings)
        *   Duration (time until slice expires)
    *   **Slice Handover:**  As the user moves, seamlessly handover the slice to the next access point on the predicted path.
*   **Output:** Assigned network slice configuration (frequency, channel, priority, duration). Slice handover instructions.

**4.  Access Point Software Enhancement:**

*   **Slice Management:**  Ability to create, manage, and prioritize network slices.
*   **QoS Enforcement:**  Enforce QoS settings for each slice.
*   **Slice Monitoring:**  Monitor slice performance (bandwidth, latency, packet loss).
*   **Reporting:** Report slice usage and performance data to the central system.

**Pseudocode (Slice Allocation):**

```
function allocateSlice(user, predictedPath, bandwidthNeeded, reputation):
  // Calculate bid based on bandwidth needed and reputation
  bid = bandwidthNeeded * reputation

  // Find available access points along the predicted path
  accessPoints = findAccessPoints(predictedPath)

  // Run auction for slices at each access point
  for each accessPoint in accessPoints:
    winningBid = runAuction(accessPoint, bid)
    if winningBid == bid:
      // Allocate slice at the access point
      createSlice(accessPoint, bandwidthNeeded)
      logSliceAllocation(accessPoint, user, bandwidthNeeded)
```

**Novelty:** This differs from the original patent by proactively allocating resources *before* a transfer begins, based on predicted needs and reputation.  It’s not just a reciprocal data exchange, but a more intelligent, QoS-driven system.  The combination of predictive mobility, reputation-based bidding, and dynamic slice creation represents a significant advance.
