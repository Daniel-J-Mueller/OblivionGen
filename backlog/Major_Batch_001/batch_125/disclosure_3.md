## Dynamic Data Tiering with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the logical partition assignment to incorporate a tiered storage system *and* predictive data prefetching based on query history and learned data access patterns. Instead of just assigning blocks to partitions for a single query, dynamically tier data based on predicted access frequency and prefetch blocks to faster storage tiers *before* they are requested.

**Specs:**

*   **Storage Tiers:** Define multiple storage tiers (e.g., NVMe SSD, SATA SSD, HDD, Object Storage). Each tier has a cost/performance profile.
*   **Access History Database:** Maintain a database tracking query access patterns for each data block. Records should include timestamps, query predicates, access frequency, and read/write ratio.
*   **Predictive Model:** Implement a machine learning model (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory) trained on the access history database. This model predicts the probability of a data block being accessed within a defined time window.
*   **Tiering Policy Engine:** A policy engine governs data movement between tiers. The engine uses predictions from the predictive model and user-defined cost/performance thresholds to determine optimal tier placement for each block.
*   **Prefetching Engine:**  Based on the predictive model, proactively prefetch blocks predicted to be accessed soon into faster storage tiers. Implement a 'grace period' to avoid unnecessary prefetching for short-lived queries.
*   **Logical Partition Integration:**  The existing logical partition assignment system is extended. Instead of *just* assigning to a partition, the system also dictates the *storage tier* for those blocks.  Logical partitions can span multiple tiers.
*   **Query Rewriting:**  The query optimizer rewrites queries to take advantage of tiered storage.  Access to data on faster tiers is prioritized.

**Pseudocode (Tiering Policy Engine):**

```
function tier_data(block_id, prediction_score, current_tier):
  target_tier = current_tier

  if prediction_score > HIGH_THRESHOLD and current_tier == HDD:
    target_tier = SSD
  elif prediction_score > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD and current_tier == SATA_SSD:
    target_tier = NVMe_SSD
  elif prediction_score < LOW_THRESHOLD and current_tier == NVMe_SSD:
    target_tier = SATA_SSD
  elif prediction_score < LOW_THRESHOLD and current_tier == SATA_SSD:
    target_tier = HDD

  if target_tier != current_tier:
    move_data(block_id, current_tier, target_tier)

function move_data(block_id, source_tier, target_tier):
  //Initiate data transfer from source to target. Implement error handling and checksum verification.
  //Log the data movement event.
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `BlockMetadata`: {`block_id`, `current_tier`, `prediction_score`, `access_history`}
*   `TierConfiguration`: {`tier_name`, `cost`, `performance`, `capacity`}

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced query latency by storing frequently accessed data on faster storage.
*   Optimized storage costs by automatically moving infrequently accessed data to cheaper tiers.
*   Improved overall system performance and scalability.
*   Dynamic adaptation to changing workload patterns.
