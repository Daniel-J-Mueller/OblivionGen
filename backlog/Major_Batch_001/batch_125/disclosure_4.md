## Dynamic Topical Drift Detection & Proactive Suggestion

**Concept:** Extend the keyword/topic-based suggestion system to *actively detect shifts* in topical relevance within a user’s interaction history and proactively adjust suggestions *before* explicit user signals indicate a change in interest. This moves beyond static keyword matching to a dynamic, predictive model of user intent.

**Specs:**

1.  **Temporal Keyword Weighting:**  Assign decay rates to keywords based on recency of user interaction.  Newer keywords receive higher weights, while older keywords gradually diminish.  This creates a “hotness” score for each keyword.

    ```pseudocode
    function calculate_keyword_hotness(keyword, last_interaction_timestamp, decay_rate):
        time_delta = current_timestamp - last_interaction_timestamp
        hotness = exp(-decay_rate * time_delta)
        return hotness
    ```

2.  **Drift Vector Calculation:**  Compute a “drift vector” representing the change in keyword weight distribution over time windows (e.g., last hour, last day, last week). This vector quantifies the direction and magnitude of topical shift.

    ```pseudocode
    function calculate_drift_vector(keyword_weights_current, keyword_weights_previous):
        drift_vector = {}
        for keyword in keyword_weights_current:
            weight_change = keyword_weights_current[keyword] - keyword_weights_previous[keyword]
            drift_vector[keyword] = weight_change
        return drift_vector
    ```

3.  **Proactive Suggestion Adjustment:**  When the magnitude of the drift vector exceeds a predefined threshold, trigger a re-ranking of suggestions.  Prioritize suggestions associated with keywords exhibiting the most significant positive drift. Implement a 'soft landing' system, where the re-ranking isn't immediate, but gradually increases the weighting of new topics.

    ```pseudocode
    function adjust_suggestions(suggestions, drift_vector, adjustment_rate):
        for suggestion in suggestions:
            # Get keywords associated with suggestion
            keywords = suggestion.keywords
            # Calculate a drift score for the suggestion
            drift_score = 0
            for keyword in keywords:
                drift_score += drift_vector.get(keyword, 0)  # Use 0 if keyword not in drift vector
            # Adjust the suggestion's rank based on the drift score
            suggestion.rank -= adjustment_rate * drift_score
        # Sort suggestions by new rank
        suggestions.sort(key=lambda x: x.rank)
        return suggestions
    ```

4.  **Topic Coherence Filtering:**  Incorporate a topic coherence score to filter out spurious or irrelevant topic shifts.  This prevents the system from reacting to noise or temporary fluctuations. Use a metric like UMass or c_v to quantify topic coherence.

5.  **Personalized Decay Rates:** Allow decay rates to be personalized based on user behaviour. Users with stable preferences might have slower decay rates, while users who frequently explore new topics might have faster decay rates.

6.  **Multi-Level Drift Detection:** Implement drift detection at multiple levels of granularity.  Monitor drift at the keyword level, the topic level, and even at the broader category level to capture both subtle and significant shifts in user intent.
