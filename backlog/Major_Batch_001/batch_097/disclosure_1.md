## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Predictive Filtering

**Core Concept:** Leveraging the sound profile generation outlined in the patent to *reconstruct* the acoustic environment *before* full speech recognition is attempted, and then using this reconstruction to dynamically filter incoming audio, prioritizing relevant sounds and suppressing noise *before* it reaches the ASR pipeline. This moves beyond simply identifying and suppressing known commands to anticipating and isolating potentially relevant audio within a complex environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Database:** A cloud-based database of recorded acoustic scenes (e.g., ‘busy street’, ‘office’, ‘home living room’, ‘restaurant’). Each scene is categorized and tagged with relevant sound events (e.g., ‘car horn’, ‘human speech’, ‘typing’, ‘music’). Database is expandable via user contributions (opt-in, anonymized data).
*   **Initial Sound Profile Generation:** As per the patent, generate a sound profile when a high count of similar audio inputs is detected. This signals a potentially consistent acoustic scene.
*   **Scene Matching Algorithm:** Implement an algorithm to compare the generated sound profile to the acoustic scene database. The algorithm uses spectral analysis, temporal patterns, and identified sound events to determine the closest matching scene(s).  Output is a probability distribution of likely scenes.
*   **Predictive Filtering Network:** A neural network (specifically a recurrent neural network with attention mechanisms) trained to predict the likely *temporal evolution* of sounds within the identified acoustic scene(s). This network learns the typical order and characteristics of sounds within each scene.
*   **Dynamic Audio Decomposition:** Incoming audio is decomposed into multiple frequency bands. The predictive filtering network is applied to each band.
*   **Relevance Scoring:** Each frequency band’s output is assigned a relevance score based on:
    *   **Predicted Probability:** How well the band’s characteristics match the predicted sound events.
    *   **Energy Level:** The overall intensity of the band.
    *   **Command Keyword Detection (Initial Pass):** A lightweight keyword detection algorithm to flag potential command-related frequencies.
*   **Adaptive Filtering:** The audio signal is filtered based on the relevance scores. Bands with low scores are attenuated or suppressed. Bands with high scores, particularly those containing potential command keywords, are amplified.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** The filtered audio is then passed to the ASR pipeline.  The ASR’s confidence scores are fed back into the relevance scoring algorithm, refining the filtering process in real-time.
*   **User Customization:** Users can manually override the filtering settings for specific acoustic scenes or sound events.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Relevance Scoring):**

```
function calculate_relevance_score(frequency_band, scene_prediction, asr_confidence) {
  predicted_probability = scene_prediction.get_probability(frequency_band);
  energy_level = frequency_band.get_energy();
  keyword_detected = frequency_band.keyword_detected();

  relevance_score = (0.5 * predicted_probability) + (0.2 * energy_level) + (0.3 * keyword_detected);

  return relevance_score;
}

function apply_filtering(audio_signal, relevance_scores, threshold) {
  filtered_signal = audio_signal;
  for each frequency_band in audio_signal {
    if (relevance_scores[frequency_band] < threshold) {
      filtered_signal[frequency_band] = 0; // Attenuate
    } else {
      filtered_signal[frequency_band] = filtered_signal[frequency_band] * 1.2; // Amplify
    }
  }
  return filtered_signal;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Improved voice assistant performance in noisy environments.
*   Enhanced speech recognition for accessibility applications.
*   Real-time noise cancellation for communication devices.
*   Automatic audio event detection and classification.
*   Context-aware audio processing for smart home devices.
