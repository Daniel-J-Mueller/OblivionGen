**Adaptive Sensory Storytelling – Biofeedback Driven Narrative Branching**

**Concept:** Extend the motion-based playback adjustment to incorporate real-time biometric data from the user during playback to dynamically alter the *content* of the displayed image sequence, creating a personalized and emotionally responsive viewing experience. Think of it as a visual story that responds to *how you feel* while watching.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Biometric Sensor Integration:**
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Sensor: Integrated into the apparatus (e.g., wearable, display housing).
    *   Electrodermal Activity (EDA) Sensor (GSR): Measures skin conductance, indicative of emotional arousal.
    *   Facial Expression Analysis (via camera):  Detects key emotional states (joy, sadness, fear, etc.).

2.  **Content Library & Branching:**
    *   Image Sequences: Pre-recorded sequences are tagged with emotional ‘valence’ and ‘arousal’ levels.
    *   Branching Points: Within the image sequence, designated branching points allow for switching between different subsequences based on user biometric data.
    *   Content Variants:  For each branching point, multiple image/video subsequences exist, each designed to evoke a different emotional response. (e.g., a calming scene vs. an exciting scene).
    *   Narrative Scripting Language: A specialized scripting language to define the branching logic based on biometric thresholds and combinations.

3.  **Real-time Data Processing & Playback Adjustment:**

    ```pseudocode
    function adjustPlayback(currentImage, biometricData) {
      // Extract relevant biometric features
      hrv = biometricData.hrv
      eda = biometricData.eda
      emotion = biometricData.emotion

      // Determine emotional state
      if (emotion == "sad" && eda > threshold_low) {
        nextImage = chooseImage("comforting_scene")
      } else if (hrv < threshold_low && emotion == "fear") {
        nextImage = chooseImage("calming_scene")
      } else if (eda > threshold_high && emotion == "joy") {
        nextImage = chooseImage("exciting_scene")
      } else {
        nextImage = currentImage.nextImage // Default progression
      }

      return nextImage
    }
    ```

4.  **Calibration & Personalization:**
    *   Initial Baseline Recording: Before playback, the system records a baseline biometric profile of the user.
    *   Adaptive Thresholds: Biometric thresholds for branching are dynamically adjusted based on the user’s baseline and observed responses.
    *   User Preference Profiles: Allow users to customize the emotional ‘tone’ of the experience (e.g., "more calming," "more exciting").

5.  **Output & Display:**
    *   Seamless Transition:  The system should seamlessly transition between image subsequences, avoiding jarring cuts.
    *   Augmented Reality Integration: Potentially overlay AR elements onto the displayed image to further enhance the emotional impact. (e.g., calming visuals during a stress response).
