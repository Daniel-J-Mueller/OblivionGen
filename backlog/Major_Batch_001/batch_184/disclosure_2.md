## Dynamic Access Zones & Geofencing Integration

**Concept:** Extend the text-based access system to incorporate dynamic access zones defined by geofencing and time-based permissions. Instead of simply granting/denying access based on a user's identity and schedule, the system assesses *where* the user is attempting access from *in addition* to *when*.

**Specs:**

*   **Geofence Definition:** Admin interface (web/app) allowing the first user to define geofences around the structure (home, building, etc.). Multiple geofences possible (e.g., front yard, driveway, specific sections of a large property).
*   **Geofence-Linked Permissions:**  Assign access permissions (unlock/lock) *specifically* to each geofence.  For example:
    *   "Unlock front door *only* when user is within 10 meters of the front door geofence *and* between 8 AM - 6 PM."
    *   "Allow access to garage *only* when user is within the driveway geofence *and* is listed as an 'authorized driver' in the system."
*   **Location Verification:** Integrate with device location services (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, Bluetooth beacons).  When a text request is received:
    1.  Determine the user's approximate location.
    2.  Check if the location falls within an authorized geofence.
    3.  Verify time constraints are met.
*   **Smart Lock Integration Enhancement:**  Modify smart lock communication protocol to include geofence ID and timestamp data.
*   **System Architecture:**

    ```pseudocode
    function processAccessRequest(textMessage, userPhoneNumber) {
      userProfile = getUserProfile(userPhoneNumber)
      if (userProfile == null) {
        return "Access Denied: User Not Authorized"
      }

      userLocation = getLocation(userPhoneNumber) // Use device location services

      authorizedGeofences = userProfile.authorizedGeofences

      accessGranted = false
      for (geofence in authorizedGeofences) {
        if (isWithinGeofence(userLocation, geofence) &&
            isWithinTimeSchedule(geofence.timeSchedule)) {
          accessGranted = true
          break
        }
      }

      if (accessGranted) {
        sendLockUnlockInstruction(userProfile.smartLock, userProfile.accessCode)
        return "Access Granted"
      } else {
        return "Access Denied: Location/Time Not Authorized"
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Notification System Expansion:** Notifications sent to the first user include location data of the access attempt (e.g., “John attempted access from the front yard at 2:30 PM”).
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Layer geofencing on top of existing access code/schedule verification for heightened security.
*   **"Proximity Unlock" Mode:** Option to automatically unlock the door when an authorized user approaches within a defined proximity of a geofence (requires robust security measures to prevent accidental unlocks).
