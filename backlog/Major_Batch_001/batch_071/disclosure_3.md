## Adaptive UI Element Swapping & Contextual Redaction

**Concept:** Expand upon selective obscuring of sensitive data during remote support sessions by not just masking *content*, but swapping UI elements entirely with functionally equivalent, non-sensitive counterparts. This creates a dynamic “safe mode” for the user interface presented to the support agent.

**Specs:**

**1. UI Element Catalog & Mapping:**

*   Maintain a catalog of common UI elements (text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, sliders, etc.).
*   For each element, store multiple “variants” – a standard version and a “safe” version. Safe versions visually resemble the standard versions but do *not* directly expose sensitive input. For example:
    *   A standard password field is replaced with a field that only displays asterisks and character count.
    *   A text field for credit card number is replaced with a field that only displays the last four digits and card type.
    *   A dropdown list of account numbers is replaced with a dropdown of masked account identifiers (e.g., "Account 1", "Account 2").
*   This catalog is stored centrally and updated regularly.
*   A metadata structure for each element is required:
    *   `element_type`: (text field, dropdown, checkbox, etc.)
    *   `sensitivity_level`: (high, medium, low, none)
    *   `safe_variant_id`: Unique identifier for the safe version of this element.
    *   `functional_equivalence_script`:  A short script defining how the safe variant behaves - i.e. how to interpret input and transmit relevant (non-sensitive) data.

**2. Real-time UI Analysis & Element Identification:**

*   A background process on the user's device continuously monitors the active window and identifies UI elements using a combination of:
    *   Accessibility APIs (e.g., UI Automation on Windows, Accessibility on macOS).
    *   Image recognition (to identify elements that lack proper accessibility metadata).
    *   Heuristic analysis (to infer element type and purpose based on visual cues and context).
*   Each identified element is cross-referenced with the UI Element Catalog to determine its sensitivity level.

**3. Dynamic Element Swapping:**

*   When a remote support session is initiated (or upon agent request), the system begins swapping sensitive UI elements with their safe variants.
*   The swapping process is designed to be seamless and non-disruptive to the user.
*   A unique identifier is associated with each swapped element, allowing the system to track changes and restore the original element when the support session ends.
*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```
    function swap_element(element, safe_variant_id) {
        original_element_data = get_element_data(element) // capture original properties
        safe_element = create_element(safe_variant_id)
        apply_original_properties(safe_element, original_element_data)
        replace_element(element, safe_element)
        store_swap_info(element, safe_element, original_element_data)
    }
    ```

**4. Secure Data Handling & Functional Equivalence:**

*   Input received by safe UI elements is processed locally to extract relevant (non-sensitive) information.
*   This information is then securely transmitted to the support agent.
*   The `functional_equivalence_script` associated with each safe element defines how this data is processed and transmitted. For example:
    *   A safe password field might transmit only the length of the password and a hash of the first character.
    *   A safe credit card field might transmit only the card type and the last four digits.

**5. Session Restoration:**

*   When the remote support session ends, the system restores the original UI elements.
*   Any data that was captured by the safe elements is securely discarded.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **AI-Powered Element Identification:**  Integrate machine learning models to improve the accuracy of UI element identification, especially for custom or dynamic UI elements.
*   **User Customization:**  Allow users to customize the sensitivity levels of different UI elements and define their own safe variants.
*   **Multi-Platform Support:**  Develop the system to be compatible with a variety of operating systems and platforms.
