## Autonomous Data Relocation & ‘Ghosting’ System

**Concept:** Extend the data destruction concept to *proactive* data relocation based on predicted risk, combined with a ‘ghosting’ protocol where data is fragmented & distributed *before* a disconnection event, making complete destruction unnecessary (or a last resort). This system assumes data has varying levels of sensitivity & acceptable loss.

**Specs:**

**1. Risk Assessment Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time telemetry from storage devices (power fluctuations, physical jostle detected by accelerometers, network connectivity health, geolocation shifts, user access patterns).  External threat feeds (e.g., known malicious IP addresses accessing the storage network).  Data sensitivity tags (assigned by user or automated classification).
*   **Processing:** Weighted risk score calculation based on input data.  Machine learning model to predict potential compromise events (theft, tampering, environmental disaster, network breach) with probabilistic confidence levels.
*   **Output:**  Risk score and associated action recommendation (no action, prepare for relocation, initiate relocation, initiate destruction).

**2. Dynamic Data Fragmentation & Distribution:**

*   **Protocol:** Implement a Reed-Solomon error correction code-based fragmentation.  Data is split into *n* shards.  A pre-defined *k* shards are sufficient to reconstruct the original data.
*   **Distribution:** Shards are distributed across a geographically diverse network of storage nodes, prioritizing locations with low risk scores.  Dynamic routing algorithms adjust shard locations in response to changing risk assessments.
*   **Reconstruction:** Clients request data segments. The system dynamically locates and assembles the necessary shards, prioritizing low-latency connections.

**3. ‘Ghosting’ Protocol & Disconnection Event Handling:**

*   **Trigger:** Risk score exceeding a threshold, or detection of a disconnection event.
*   **Action:**
    *   If risk score triggers *before* disconnection: Initiate data relocation as described above.
    *   On disconnection:
        *   Attempt secure erasure of any remaining locally stored data.
        *   If erasure fails (e.g., power loss during erasure): Report data as compromised, but rely on redundancy provided by distributed shards.
*   **Data Availability:**  Even with complete device loss, *k* shards remain accessible, allowing data reconstruction.

**4. Hardware Integration:**

*   **Storage Device Modification:** Integrate accelerometer, GPS, and secure microcontroller into storage device enclosure.
*   **Network Controller:** Dedicated network controller to manage shard distribution, reconstruction, and secure communication.
*   **Secure Enclave:** Secure enclave within microcontroller to store encryption keys and manage secure operations.

**5. Pseudocode - Risk Assessment Loop:**

```
LOOP:
    READ sensor data (accelerometer, GPS, network health, power)
    FETCH external threat intelligence
    READ data sensitivity tags
    CALCULATE risk score (weighted sum of all inputs)
    IF risk score > threshold:
        INITIATE data relocation protocol
        SEND alert to administrators
    ENDIF
    SLEEP (configurable interval)
GOTO LOOP
```

**6. Extended Functionality:**

*   **Blockchain Integration:** Utilize blockchain to securely track shard locations and data ownership.
*   **Quantum-Resistant Encryption:** Implement quantum-resistant encryption algorithms to protect data against future threats.
*   **Automated Data Classification:**  Utilize machine learning to automatically classify data sensitivity levels.
