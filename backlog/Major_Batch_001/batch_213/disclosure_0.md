## Adaptive Emotional Tone Routing

**Concept:** Extend message redirection to factor in detected emotional tone of the utterance and route messages to recipients based on emotional compatibility or need.

**Specifications:**

*   **Emotional Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Audio data of an utterance.
    *   Process: Employ a real-time emotion detection model (e.g., utilizing spectrogram analysis, prosody, and lexical cues) to identify dominant emotional state(s) – happiness, sadness, anger, frustration, neutrality, anxiety, etc. – and a confidence score for each.
    *   Output: Emotion vector representing the detected emotional state(s) and confidence levels.
*   **Recipient Emotional Profiles:**
    *   Data Storage: Maintain user profiles including expressed preferences for emotional support, preferred communication styles, and historical data on emotional responsiveness. This data will be derived from direct input, communication patterns, and potentially, social media activity (with explicit user consent).
    *   Emotional Compatibility Score: Algorithm to calculate a score reflecting the emotional compatibility between the sender and potential recipients, based on profile data and current emotional states.
*   **Routing Engine:**
    *   Input: Emotion vector from Emotional Analysis Module, list of potential recipients, and Recipient Emotional Profiles.
    *   Process:
        1.  Determine the intended recipient based on existing logic (as defined in the base patent).
        2.  Evaluate the emotional compatibility score between the sender and the intended recipient.
        3.  If the compatibility score falls below a defined threshold *and* an alternative recipient exists with a higher compatibility score (and meets other routing criteria, such as availability), redirect the message.
        4.  Prioritize recipients based on factors like history of providing emotional support, stated preferences, and relationship closeness.
        5.  In cases of high emotional distress detected in the sender, proactively alert a pre-defined "support network" – a list of trusted contacts chosen by the user.
*   **User Control & Privacy:**
    *   Opt-in Feature:  Emotional tone routing must be an explicitly enabled feature.
    *   Granular Control: Users can define preferred emotional support contacts, set thresholds for redirection, and control the level of data sharing.
    *   Data Anonymization: Anonymized data may be used to improve the accuracy of the emotion detection model and personalization algorithms.
    *   Transparent Logging: Users have access to a log of redirection decisions and the factors that influenced them.

**Pseudocode (Routing Engine):**

```
function routeMessage(audioData, recipientList, userProfiles):
  intendedRecipient = determineInitialRecipient(audioData)
  senderEmotion = analyzeEmotion(audioData)

  bestAlternative = null
  highestCompatibility = -1

  for each recipient in recipientList:
    if recipient != intendedRecipient:
      compatibility = calculateEmotionalCompatibility(senderEmotion, recipient.profile)
      if compatibility > highestCompatibility:
        highestCompatibility = compatibility
        bestAlternative = recipient

  if highestCompatibility > compatibilityThreshold:
    if bestAlternative != null:
      redirectMessage(bestAlternative)
      return
  
  sendMessage(intendedRecipient)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Crisis intervention & mental health support
*   Team communication & conflict resolution
*   Personalized customer service
*   Enhanced accessibility for individuals with emotional or social challenges.
