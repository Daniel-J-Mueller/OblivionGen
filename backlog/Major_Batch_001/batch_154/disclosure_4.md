## Dynamic Review ‘Provenance’ & Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Expand the selection strategy beyond simply *what* reviews are presented, to *how* those reviews were generated and their assessed trustworthiness. The current patent focuses on selecting representative reviews based on volume and coverage. This expands that to incorporate a ‘provenance’ layer, assessing the origin and quality of the review data itself, and incorporating a trust score into the selection process.

**Specs:**

1.  **Review Provenance Data Structure:**
    *   `ReviewID`: Unique identifier for each review.
    *   `UserID`: Identifier of the user who submitted the review.
    *   `SubmissionTimestamp`: Timestamp of review submission.
    *   `IPAddress`: IP address used for submission.
    *   `Geolocation`: Geolocation derived from IP address.
    *   `DeviceType`: Device used for submission (mobile, desktop, etc.).
    *   `ReviewSource`: Platform/API where review originated (e.g., website, app, social media).
    *   `VerifiedStatus`: Boolean indicating if user account is verified.
    *   `ReviewHistory`: Number of previous reviews submitted by the user.
    *   `FlagHistory`: Number of times review/user has been flagged for suspicious activity.
    *   `SentimentAnalysisScore`: Numerical score representing sentiment of review (positive, negative, neutral).
    *    `ContentSimilarityScore`: A score indicating how similar this review is to other reviews. High similarity could indicate bot-like behavior.

2.  **Trust Score Algorithm:**
    *   `BaseScore`: Initial score for all reviews (e.g., 50).
    *   `VerificationBonus`: Add bonus points for verified user accounts.
    *   `ReviewHistoryPenalty`: Subtract points based on the user’s review history (to prevent spam).
    *   `GeolocationPenalty`: Adjust score based on geolocation (flag potential bot farms).
    *   `DeviceTypePenalty`: Adjust score based on device type (flag suspicious device types).
    *   `FlagPenalty`: Significantly reduce score for flagged reviews/users.
    *   `SentimentDiversityBonus`: Award bonus points if the review adds to the diversity of expressed sentiment (avoiding echo chambers).
    *   `ContentSimilarityPenalty`: Penalize for high similarity to other reviews.

    `TrustScore = BaseScore + VerificationBonus - ReviewHistoryPenalty - GeolocationPenalty - DeviceTypePenalty - FlagPenalty + SentimentDiversityBonus - ContentSimilarityPenalty`

3.  **Modified Selection Strategies:**
    *   **Maximum-Set-Coverage with Trust:** When using maximum-set-coverage, prioritize reviews with higher TrustScores. The algorithm should aim to cover key aspects *and* present trustworthy sources.
    *   **Clustering with Trust:** When clustering reviews, incorporate TrustScore as a weighting factor. Clusters should be evaluated based on both similarity *and* overall trustworthiness.  Within each cluster, select the highest-TrustScore review.
    *   **Dynamic Thresholding:** Implement a dynamic threshold for TrustScore. Reviews below the threshold are excluded from the selection process. The threshold can be adjusted based on the overall quality of reviews being received.

4.  **Pseudocode - Modified Maximum-Set-Coverage:**

```
function selectRepresentativeReviews(reviews, desiredCount, keywords, trustThreshold):
  filteredReviews = reviews where review.trustScore >= trustThreshold
  coveredKeywords = []
  selectedReviews = []

  while selectedReviews.length < desiredCount and filteredReviews.length > 0:
    bestReview = null
    maxCoverage = 0

    for review in filteredReviews:
      coverage = 0
      for keyword in keywords:
        if keyword in review.text:
          coverage += 1
      if coverage > maxCoverage and review not in selectedReviews:
        maxCoverage = coverage
        bestReview = review

    if bestReview != null:
      selectedReviews.add(bestReview)
    else:
        break #No more reviews that cover new keywords

  return selectedReviews
```

5.  **Data Pipeline Enhancement:** Integrate the TrustScore calculation into the existing review processing pipeline. Calculate the score as soon as a review is submitted and store it alongside other review metadata. This allows for real-time assessment and dynamic selection.
