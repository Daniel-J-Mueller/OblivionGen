## Dynamic Review Weighting Based on Temporal Decay & Source Verification

**Concept:** Extend the review selection process by factoring in review age and source trustworthiness. This moves beyond static utility scores based solely on content, introducing a dynamic weighting system that prioritizes recent, verified information.

**Specs:**

1.  **Temporal Decay Function:**
    *   Implement a decay function (e.g., exponential, logarithmic) that reduces a review's utility score over time.
    *   Parameter: `decay_rate` (configurable). Higher values mean faster decay. Default: 0.01 (1% reduction per unit of time).
    *   Time Unit: Configurable (days, weeks, months).
    *   Formula: `decayed_utility = original_utility * exp(-decay_rate * time_since_review)`

2.  **Source Verification System:**
    *   Maintain a database of review sources (e.g., verified purchasers, expert reviewers, user profiles with established history).
    *   Assign a `trust_score` to each source. This score is initially set and can be adjusted based on factors like:
        *   Review consistency (agreement with other sources)
        *   User verification level (e.g., email, phone, address)
        *   Reporting flags (suspicious activity)
    *   Trust Score Range: 0.0 - 1.0 (0.0 = untrusted, 1.0 = fully trusted).

3.  **Combined Utility Calculation:**
    *   Modify the existing utility calculation to include the temporal decay and trust score:
        *   `combined_utility = original_utility * decayed_utility * trust_score`

4.  **Cluster-Level Adjustment:**
    *   Introduce a cluster-level ‘freshness’ factor. If a cluster consistently contains older reviews, its overall representation weight will be reduced. This ensures diversity isn't achieved solely through outdated information.
    *   `cluster_freshness = average(decayed_utility_of_reviews_in_cluster)`
    *   Apply `cluster_freshness` as a multiplier to the cluster's representation weight.

5.  **API Integration:**
    *   Expose an API endpoint to allow external systems to submit review sources for verification and receive a `trust_score`.
    *   API endpoint: `/verify_source` (POST request with source information).
    *   Response: JSON object containing `source_id` and `trust_score`.

6.  **Pseudocode Integration (within existing system):**

```pseudocode
// Within the review selection loop for each cluster:

FOR EACH review IN cluster:
    // Calculate decayed utility
    time_since_review = current_time - review.timestamp
    decayed_utility = review.utility * exp(-decay_rate * time_since_review)

    // Get trust score from source database
    trust_score = get_trust_score(review.source_id)

    // Calculate combined utility
    combined_utility = decayed_utility * trust_score

    // Update review's utility score
    review.utility = combined_utility

// Select the review with the highest combined utility within the cluster
selected_review = find_max(cluster, review.utility)
```

7.  **Scalability Considerations:**
    *   Cache frequently accessed `trust_score` values.
    *   Implement asynchronous processing for source verification requests.
    *   Database indexing to optimize queries for review timestamps and source IDs.
