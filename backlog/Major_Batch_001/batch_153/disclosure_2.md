## Dynamic Haptic Feedback System for Proximity Sharing

**Concept:** Extend the multi-touch gesture sharing concept by incorporating localized haptic feedback on *both* devices during the transfer. This feedback wouldn’t just confirm the gesture, but dynamically represent the ‘texture’ or properties of the shared digital item.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Engine Integration:** Both devices must include localized haptic engines (piezoelectric actuators, micro-motors, etc.) distributed across the touch-sensitive surface. Density: minimum 20 actuators per 100cm^2.
*   **Digital Item Profiling:** A metadata schema is required for all shareable digital items. This schema includes:
    *   `haptic_profile`: A data structure defining the desired haptic feedback.  This could be a waveform, a set of vibration frequencies & amplitudes, or a more complex simulation of surface texture.
    *   `texture_map`:  For image/video items, an associated texture map defining the surface feel.
    *   `material_type`: Categorical data (e.g., ‘wood’, ‘metal’, ‘fabric’, ‘glass’) triggering predefined haptic profiles.
*   **Gesture-Haptic Synchronization:**
    1.  The initiating device detects the multi-touch gesture and begins transmitting the digital item *and* its `haptic_profile` to the receiving device.
    2.  As the user’s fingers move during the gesture, the initiating device's haptic engine simulates the “push” or “drag” of the item against the fingers. The pressure sensitivity of the touch screen dictates the intensity.
    3.  On the receiving device, the haptic engine mirrors this sensation, creating the illusion of the item physically moving from one device to the other. This is achieved by delaying the haptic feedback on the receiving end, precisely timed to match the perceived travel distance of the gesture.
    4.  Upon successful transfer, the receiving device’s haptic engine settles into a static “feel” matching the `haptic_profile` of the item, as if the user is holding it.
*   **Dynamic Texture Mapping:** For images/videos, the `texture_map` is utilized to dynamically modulate the haptic feedback as the user "touches" different areas of the item on the receiving device. This requires a real-time rendering engine that translates image data into haptic commands.
*   **Multi-Item Haptic Differentiation:**  The system should support the simultaneous transfer of multiple items, each with its own distinct haptic profile.  The system will differentiate by localized haptic signals, using spatial separation (distinct vibration zones) and temporal modulation (varying pulse sequences).
*   **Calibration Routine:** A user-accessible calibration routine to adjust haptic feedback intensity and customize profiles. This allows users to fine-tune the experience based on personal preference and device characteristics.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
//Initiating Device
OnMultiTouchGestureDetected(gestureData, digitalItem) {
  Transmit(digitalItem, digitalItem.haptic_profile)
  ActivateHapticEngine(gestureData, digitalItem.haptic_profile)
}

//Receiving Device
OnDataReceived(digitalItem, haptic_profile) {
  DelayHapticActivation(gestureTravelTime) //calculate delay based on gesture distance & estimated transfer speed
  ActivateHapticEngine(haptic_profile)
}
```
