## Adaptive Device Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the naming functionality to create dynamically evolving “personas” for voice-controlled devices, going beyond simple naming to imbue devices with behavioral traits and response styles.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Definition:** A user interface (UI) allowing users to define personas. Persona attributes include:
    *   **Voice Profile:** Selectable voice characteristics (pitch, tone, accent, speed).
    *   **Response Style:**  Presets (e.g., "helpful assistant," "sarcastic companion," "formal butler," "childlike") or custom-defined parameters impacting phrasing, vocabulary, and sentence structure.
    *   **Knowledge Domain:**  Areas of expertise.  The device prioritizes information retrieval and response generation from these domains. (e.g., “cooking,” “history,” “sports”).
    *   **Emotional State:** (Optional) A slider to adjust baseline "mood" – influencing response tone and phrasing. (e.g., “optimistic,” “neutral,” “pessimistic”).
    *   **Proactive Behavior:**  Defines circumstances where the device initiates conversation or provides information *without* being explicitly asked. (e.g., "remind me about traffic before my commute," "announce weather changes," "offer recipe suggestions based on pantry inventory").
*   **Dynamic Persona Application:**
    *   Devices can have multiple defined personas.
    *   The user can explicitly switch personas via voice command ("Switch kitchen device to ‘Chef’ persona").
    *   Contextual Persona Switching: The system infers the appropriate persona based on the current activity, time of day, location, or user identity. (e.g., "Kitchen device automatically switches to ‘Chef’ persona when cooking is detected," "Living room device switches to ‘Movie Critic’ persona when streaming a film”).
*   **Persona Learning:** The system passively learns user preferences and refines persona behaviors over time.
    *   User Feedback: Users can rate persona responses ("That was a helpful response," "That response wasn't relevant").
    *   Behavioral Analysis: The system analyzes user interactions to identify patterns and adjust persona behaviors accordingly. (e.g., if a user consistently rejects sarcastic responses, the system reduces the frequency of sarcasm in that persona).
*   **Cross-Device Persona Consistency:**  User-defined personas can be synchronized across multiple devices. (e.g., if a user defines a "helpful assistant" persona, all voice-controlled devices will adopt that persona).
*   **API for Persona Creation and Management:** An open API allowing developers to create and share custom personas.

**Pseudocode (Contextual Persona Switching):**

```
function DetermineOptimalPersona(device, activity, timeOfDay, location, userId) {
  // Define Persona Rules (example)
  if (activity == "cooking" && location == "kitchen") {
    return "Chef";
  } else if (timeOfDay == "evening" && location == "living room" && activity == "watching movie") {
    return "Movie Critic";
  } else if (userId == "child") {
    return "Storyteller";
  } else {
    return "Default"; //Standard helpful assistant persona
  }
}

function HandleVoiceCommand(device, commandText) {
  optimalPersona = DetermineOptimalPersona(device, currentActivity, currentTime, currentLocation, currentUserId);
  // Load persona settings (voice, response style, knowledge domain)
  ApplyPersonaSettings(device, optimalPersona);
  ProcessVoiceCommand(device, commandText);
}
```
