## Dynamic Content Aging & Tiered Protection

**Concept:** Expand the ‘protected from eviction’ concept beyond simple recency. Implement a dynamic aging system where content protection levels *decay* over time, offering tiered access based on content ‘freshness’ and provider-defined policies. This moves beyond simply preventing eviction – it introduces controlled, time-based degradation of caching priority.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Structure – ‘Cache Lifetime’ Metadata:** Each cached object receives an associated ‘Cache Lifetime’ value (numeric, representing time units - e.g., hours). This is *separate* from the ‘most recent access time’ and is initially set by the content provider upon first caching. Providers can update this value (reduce it, for example) via API calls.

*   **Protection Levels (Tiered):** Define three protection levels:
    *   **Level 1 – ‘Critical’:** (0-24 hours) – Absolute protection from eviction. Always prioritized for cache retention.
    *   **Level 2 – ‘Standard’:** (24-72 hours) – High protection. Evicted only under extreme cache pressure *after* all Level 1 and unprotected content.
    *   **Level 3 – ‘Degraded’:** (72+ hours) – Eviction priority equivalent to non-protected content.

*   **Cache Eviction Algorithm Modification:** The eviction algorithm is modified to consider ‘Cache Lifetime’ alongside recency. The algorithm proceeds as follows:
    1.  Identify all Level 1 (Critical) protected objects. These are *never* evicted.
    2.  Identify all Level 2 (Standard) protected objects.
    3.  Identify all unprotected objects *and* Level 3 (Degraded) objects.
    4.  Evict content from steps 3, prioritizing least recently accessed.
    5.  If cache pressure remains, *then* begin evicting Level 2 content (least recently accessed).

*   **Provider API:** Expose a provider API with the following endpoints:
    *   `SetCacheLifetime(objectID, lifetimeHours)`: Sets the ‘Cache Lifetime’ value for a specific object.
    *   `GetCacheLifetime(objectID)`: Retrieves the current ‘Cache Lifetime’ value.
    *   `PolicyOverrides(objectID, protectionLevel)`: Allows a provider to temporarily override the default protection level for a specific object (e.g., boost protection for a limited-time promotion).

*   **Content ‘Aging’ Daemon:** Implement a background daemon that periodically checks the ‘Cache Lifetime’ of cached objects and automatically downgrades their protection level if the lifetime expires (e.g., moves from Level 2 to Level 3).

*   **Dashboard/Monitoring:** Provide a dashboard for content providers to monitor the protection levels of their cached content and track cache hit/miss rates at each level.

**Pseudocode (Content Aging Daemon):**

```pseudocode
WHILE (true)
  FOR EACH object IN cache
    current_time = GetCurrentTime()
    cache_age = current_time - object.cache_timestamp

    IF (cache_age > 24 hours AND object.protection_level == "Critical")
      object.protection_level = "Standard"
    ELSE IF (cache_age > 72 hours AND object.protection_level == "Standard")
      object.protection_level = "Degraded"

  END FOR

  SLEEP(1 hour) // Check hourly
END WHILE
```

**Novelty:** This isn't simply about *preventing* eviction, but dynamically controlling how long content remains ‘highly’ cached. It provides finer-grained control for content providers and allows for more intelligent cache management. This could be particularly useful for news, social media, or promotional content where freshness is critical.
