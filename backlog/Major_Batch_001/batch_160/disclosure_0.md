## Temporal Application ‘Ecosystem’ Prediction & Pre-Load

**Concept:** Expand the time-based application launch to *predict* an entire user ‘ecosystem’ of applications likely to be used during a given time period, and proactively preload assets – not just launch the app. This goes beyond restoring state; it *anticipates* need.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Modeling:**

*   **Sensor Fusion:** Integrate data beyond time – location (GPS, Bluetooth beacons), accelerometer/gyroscope data (activity recognition – walking, driving, stationary), ambient sound analysis (meeting, quiet time), network connection type (WiFi, cellular), and calendar data (meetings, appointments).
*   **User Behavior Profiles:** Build probabilistic models of application usage based on fused sensor data *and* time. These are not simple ‘if time = X then launch App Y’ rules.  Instead, use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict a *distribution* of likely app usage for a given state.
*   **Ecosystem Definition:** An ‘ecosystem’ is defined as the set of applications the user *typically* engages with in a given context (time + location + activity). This goes beyond the immediately launched application. For example, opening a navigation app might predict near-term use of a music streaming app, a parking payment app, and a restaurant review app.
*   **Data Store:** A multi-dimensional data store. Dimensions: User ID, Time (granularity configurable – 5min, 15min, 30min blocks), Location (geo-fence/region), Activity, Application ID, Associated Application ID (ecosystem apps), Pre-load Status, Asset Status (see below).

**2. Pre-Loading & Asset Management:**

*   **Tiered Asset Pre-load:**  Instead of *just* launching the app, pre-load relevant assets:
    *   **Tier 1 (Immediate):** Core application code, essential resources for the initial screen. (already in current patent).
    *   **Tier 2 (Likely):** Assets required for the next few likely interactions within the app (e.g., pre-fetch map tiles for the route in the navigation app, pre-cache frequently accessed data).
    *   **Tier 3 (Proactive Ecosystem):** Assets for applications predicted to be used in the near future as part of the user's ecosystem. This could include pre-loading UI elements, API responses, or even running background processes to prepare data.
*   **Resource Management:** Sophisticated resource management system to avoid excessive battery drain or storage usage.  Prioritize pre-loading based on:
    *   **Probability:** How likely is the app to be used?
    *   **Asset Size:** How large is the asset?
    *   **Network Conditions:**  Pre-load over WiFi whenever possible.
    *   **Battery Level:** Adjust pre-loading aggressiveness based on battery.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Monitor actual user behavior.  If the predicted ecosystem doesn’t materialize, adapt the models and reduce pre-loading aggressiveness.

**3. System Architecture & Pseudocode:**

*   **Component: ‘Temporal Context Engine’ (TCE):**
    *   Receives sensor data and time.
    *   Queries the data store.
    *   Predicts application ecosystem.
    *   Generates pre-load requests.
*   **Component: ‘Resource Manager’ (RM):**
    *   Receives pre-load requests from TCE.
    *   Manages resource allocation.
    *   Schedules asset downloads/pre-processing.
    *   Monitors resource usage.

**Pseudocode (TCE):**

```
function predictEcosystem(userID, currentTime, currentLoc, activity):
  contextKey = createContextKey(userID, currentTime, currentLoc, activity)
  ecosystem = queryDataStore(contextKey) // Retrieve probable ecosystem
  if ecosystem is empty:
    //Default to most frequently used apps based on historical data
    ecosystem = getHistoricalDefaultEcosystem(userID)
  return ecosystem

function createContextKey(userID, currentTime, currentLoc, activity):
  //Combine userID, time bucket, geo-fence ID, and activity type
  //to create a unique key for the data store
  return key
```

**4. User Interface Considerations:**

*   **Transparency:** Provide a user setting to control the level of pre-loading.
*   **Feedback:**  Visually indicate when assets are being pre-loaded.
*   **Learning Mode:**  Allow the system to adapt to the user's behavior over time.
