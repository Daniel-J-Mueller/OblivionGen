## Dynamic Predictive Motion Zones

**Concept:** Extend the existing motion detection/alert system by adding predictive capabilities based on learned user behavior and environmental context. Instead of simply reacting to motion within defined zones, the system anticipates likely motion paths and adjusts detection sensitivity *before* movement occurs.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware Requirements:** Existing A/V device with camera and motion sensors. Addition of a low-power, dedicated AI accelerator chip for edge processing (optional but highly recommended for real-time performance).
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **Behavioral Learning Module:**  Gathers data on user movement patterns (e.g., frequently walked paths, times of day when certain areas are accessed), object tracking (identifying recurring objects and their typical trajectories), and environmental factors (lighting changes, weather patterns).  This data is stored locally.
    *   **Predictive Zone Generator:**  Uses the learned behavioral data to generate “predictive motion zones”. These zones are *dynamic* – they shift and resize based on predicted movement.  A zone might *expand* along a frequently walked path shortly *before* a user typically arrives, or *contract* in areas known to be unoccupied.
    *   **Sensitivity Adjustment Algorithm:** Controls the sensitivity of motion detection within each zone.  Zones predicted to have high motion will have *reduced* sensitivity (to minimize false positives from minor disturbances) and higher frame rates.  Areas predicted to be inactive will have increased sensitivity (to detect even subtle movement).
    *   **Contextual Awareness Module:** Integrates data from external sources (e.g., calendar appointments, weather forecasts, smart home integration – presence detection, etc.) to further refine predictive zones. For instance, if a calendar event indicates a guest is expected, the system will proactively adjust zones around the entrance.
    *   **Alert Prioritization System:**  Alerts are prioritized based on the confidence level of the prediction. High-confidence predictions trigger immediate alerts, while low-confidence predictions may be suppressed or require secondary confirmation (e.g., short video clip review).
*   **Pseudocode - Zone Generation & Sensitivity Adjustment:**

```
// Every X seconds:
1.  Retrieve behavioral data (user paths, object tracking, environmental data, calendar events).
2.  Calculate predicted motion paths based on behavioral data.
3.  Generate dynamic predictive motion zones around predicted paths.
4.  For each zone:
    a.  Calculate a "confidence score" based on the accuracy of historical predictions in that area.
    b.  Set motion detection sensitivity:
        If confidence score > threshold_high:
            sensitivity = low;  //Reduce false positives
            frame_rate = high;
        Else If confidence score > threshold_low:
            sensitivity = medium;
            frame_rate = medium;
        Else:
            sensitivity = high;
            frame_rate = low; //Prioritize detection over frame rate
5. Apply the motion detection and recording rules using these sensitivity levels
```

*   **User Interface:**
    *   Overlay visualization of predictive zones on the camera feed (optional, for debugging/configuration).
    *   User settings to adjust the influence of different behavioral data sources (e.g., prioritize calendar events over historical movement data).
    *   Configuration of sensitivity thresholds for each zone.
*   **Potential Applications:** Enhanced security systems, intelligent surveillance, proactive home automation (e.g., automatically adjusting lighting and temperature based on predicted occupancy).
