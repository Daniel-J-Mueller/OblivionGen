## Dynamic Predictive Storage Allocation via Temporal Graph Analysis

**Concept:** Expand beyond static cluster assignment to storage facilities by introducing a temporal dimension. Instead of assigning clusters *to* facilities, predict future demand fluctuations and proactively *shift* inventory between facilities based on a dynamic, time-evolving graph.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Inputs:**

*   **Historical Order Data:** (As per patent) Multi-item order information, including timestamps.
*   **Similarity Data:** (As per patent) Item similarity scores.
*   **External Event Data:** Feeds from external sources â€“ weather forecasts, holiday schedules, marketing campaign details, social media trends, economic indicators.
*   **Facility Capacity Data:** Real-time inventory levels and storage capacity for each facility.
*   **Transportation Costs:** Matrix of costs to move items between facilities.

**2. Graph Construction & Evolution:**

*   **Base Graph:** Initial graph created as described in the patent (multi-item order & similarity graphs merged).
*   **Temporal Weighting:** Edges in the base graph are assigned a time-decaying weight. Recent co-purchases have higher weight than older ones.
*   **Event-Driven Updates:**  External event data is used to *dynamically adjust* edge weights. 
    *   Example:  A hurricane forecast increases the weight of edges connected to items commonly purchased for emergency preparedness.
    *   Example: A marketing campaign focusing on outdoor grilling increases the weight of edges connected to grilling-related items.
*   **Facility Node Integration:**  Add facility nodes to the graph. Connect facility nodes to item nodes based on current inventory and historical shipping patterns.

**3. Predictive Modeling:**

*   **Time Series Forecasting:** Use time series analysis on historical order data (incorporating external event data) to predict future demand for each item.
*   **Graph-Based Propagation:**  Propagate demand signals through the graph. Increased predicted demand for one item influences the predicted demand for related items (via weighted edges).
*   **Capacity & Cost Optimization:**  Formulate an optimization problem to minimize transportation costs while meeting predicted demand, respecting facility capacities, and accounting for lead times. Use a linear or mixed-integer programming solver.

**4. Dynamic Allocation & Shipment:**

*   **Allocation Plan Generation:**  The optimization solver outputs an allocation plan specifying how much of each item should be stored at each facility in the future.
*   **Automated Shipment Orders:**  Generate automated shipment orders to transfer inventory between facilities to implement the allocation plan.
*   **Continuous Monitoring & Adjustment:**  Monitor actual demand and inventory levels in real-time. Continuously re-run the predictive model and optimization solver to adjust the allocation plan as needed.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Initialization
Create Base Graph (Order + Similarity)
Get External Event Data
Get Facility Capacity Data
Get Transportation Costs

// Main Loop (Run periodically - e.g., hourly)
Forecast Demand (using Time Series + Graph Propagation)
Formulate Optimization Problem:
    Minimize: Transportation Costs
    Subject to:
        Demand Fulfillment
        Facility Capacity Limits
        Lead Time Constraints
Solve Optimization Problem -> Allocation Plan
Generate Shipment Orders based on Allocation Plan
Monitor Actual Demand & Inventory
Update Model Parameters (e.g., time decay weights, event impact factors)
```

**Novelty:**

This goes beyond static cluster assignment by introducing a temporal dimension and proactive inventory shifting.  The use of external event data and graph propagation creates a more responsive and adaptive supply chain. This allows for 'preemptive' stock allocation and a reduction in 'out of stock' scenarios.
