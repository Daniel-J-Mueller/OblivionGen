## Dynamic Alarm Masking with Predictive Response Modeling

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive Response Engine (PRE) – Software module running on existing data center servers.
*   **Hardware Integration:** Requires integration with existing alarm systems, mobile device communication network (as in provided patent), and access to historical data logs (alarm events, responder activity, environmental data).
*   **Mobile Device App Updates:** Modifications to existing mobile alarm device app to include:
    *   Real-time location tracking (GPS/Geocoding) – Enhanced precision beyond current specs.
    *   Contextual data capture (image/video, audio notes, sensor readings – temp, humidity, air quality)
    *   Biometric authentication (facial recognition or voice print) – For higher security & responder identification.

**Innovation Description:**

The system augments the existing alarm masking functionality with a predictive layer that dynamically adjusts masking periods based on responder behavior, environmental factors, and alarm history.  Instead of a static masking time, the PRE continuously analyzes data to calculate an *optimal* masking duration.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Alarm Trigger:** Alarm event occurs and is registered by the system.
2.  **Responder Notification:** Responder receives notification via mobile device as in original patent.
3.  **Initial Masking Request:** Responder has option to request a short initial masking period (e.g., 60 seconds) through the mobile app.  This is a default setting.
4.  **Data Collection:** System begins collecting data:
    *   Responder location and speed of travel to the alarm location.
    *   Environmental data at alarm location (temperature, humidity, etc.).
    *   Historical data:  Similar alarm events, responder performance on past incidents, typical clear times.
    *   Mobile device sensor input (images, video, audio notes).
5.  **Predictive Modeling:**  The PRE uses a machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network) trained on historical data to predict:
    *   Estimated Time to Arrival (ETA) of the responder.
    *   Probability of a false alarm (based on sensor data & image analysis).
    *   Estimated Time to Clear (ETC) the alarm.
6.  **Dynamic Masking Adjustment:**
    *   The system dynamically adjusts the alarm masking period based on the PRE’s predictions.
    *   If ETA is fast and probability of a false alarm is high, the masking period is *reduced*.
    *   If ETA is slow or ETC is predicted to be long, the masking period is *extended*.
7.  **Continuous Monitoring & Adjustment:** The system continues to monitor responder progress, environmental conditions, and alarm status, adjusting the masking period in real-time.  If responder deviates significantly from predicted path or takes longer than expected, the mask is automatically reduced.
8.  **Automated Reporting:**  All masking adjustments, predictions, and responder activity are logged and available for reporting and analysis.

**Pseudocode (PRE Core):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateOptimalMasking(alarmEvent, responderLocation, environmentalData, historicalData):
    // Load historical data related to this alarm type & responder.
    data = LoadHistoricalData(alarmEvent, responderLocation)

    // Predict ETA, ProbabilityFalseAlarm, ETC using ML model.
    ETA = PredictETA(data, responderLocation)
    ProbabilityFalseAlarm = PredictFalseAlarm(data, environmentalData)
    ETC = PredictETC(data)

    // Define base masking time.
    baseMaskingTime = 60  // Seconds

    // Adjust masking time based on predictions.
    maskingTime = baseMaskingTime

    IF ETA < 30 AND ProbabilityFalseAlarm > 0.7 THEN
        maskingTime = 10  // Reduced masking
    ELSE IF ETA > 60 OR ETC > 300 THEN
        maskingTime = 180  // Extended masking
    ENDIF

    RETURN maskingTime
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced false alarm rates.
*   Faster alarm resolution times.
*   Improved responder safety.
*   More efficient use of resources.
*   Enhanced data center security.
