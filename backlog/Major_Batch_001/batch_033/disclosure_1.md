## Dynamic Garment Morphing & AR Try-On

**Concept:** Extend the sizing data collection to facilitate dynamic garment morphing within Augmented Reality (AR) for a hyper-personalized virtual try-on experience. Instead of simply showing a garment *on* a body, simulate how the garment *drapes* and *conforms* to a user’s unique dimensions, dynamically adjusting the garment’s shape in real-time.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Acquisition Enhancement:**
    *   Beyond height, weight, chest, waist, wrist – incorporate 3D body scanning data (via smartphone camera/ARKit/ARCore) to create a dense point cloud representing the user’s body shape. This allows for capturing subtleties like shoulder slope, torso curvature, and limb asymmetry.
    *   Capture user movement data (joint angles, pose estimation) during the scan to understand how the body deforms during different actions (sitting, walking, reaching).
*   **Garment Modeling:**
    *   Garments are modeled as dynamic meshes composed of simulated fabric. Each fabric type has parameters for stretch, drape, weight, and friction.
    *   The mesh resolution is adaptive, focusing detail on areas of high deformation (e.g., elbows, knees).
    *   Garment construction is modular, allowing for separate simulation of individual panels (sleeves, collar, body) for increased realism.
*   **Simulation Engine:**
    *   Utilize a physics-based simulation engine (e.g., Unity’s Cloth or a custom solver) to simulate fabric behavior.
    *   The engine solves for fabric deformation based on gravity, collision with the body, and internal material properties.
    *   Implement a constraint system to maintain the garment’s structural integrity and prevent unrealistic stretching or tearing.
*   **AR Integration:**
    *   The AR application overlays the simulated garment onto the user’s live video feed.
    *   The simulation engine runs in real-time, updating the garment’s shape based on the user’s movements.
    *   Implement accurate collision detection between the garment and the body to prevent clipping or unrealistic penetration.
*   **Sizing Refinement Loop:**
    *   Track user feedback during the AR try-on (e.g., "too tight in the shoulders", "too loose around the waist").
    *   Use this feedback to refine the garment’s virtual fit and adjust the user’s body model.
    *   This data feeds back into the sizing distributions, improving the accuracy of recommendations for future users.

**Pseudocode (AR Try-On Sequence):**

```
//Initialization
1.  User initiates AR try-on for a garment.
2.  AR app prompts user for 3D body scan.
3.  Scan captures point cloud data and movement data.
4.  AR app retrieves garment model and fabric properties.

//Simulation Loop
5.  While AR camera is active:
    6.  Capture user's current pose from camera feed.
    7.  Update user's body model based on pose data.
    8.  Run fabric simulation engine:
        9.  Apply gravity, collision, and fabric properties.
        10. Calculate garment deformation.
    11. Render simulated garment onto camera feed.
    12. Display garment and user overlayed on screen
    13. Receive user feedback (voice, gesture, touch).
    14. If feedback received:
        15. Adjust garment fit or body model.
        16. Re-run simulation.

//Data Collection
17. Store user feedback and simulation data.
18. Update sizing distributions.
```

**Additional Features:**

*   **Fabric Customization:** Allow users to select different fabric types and colors for the garment.
*   **Style Recommendations:** Suggest complementary garments and accessories based on the user’s body shape and style preferences.
*   **Social Sharing:** Enable users to share their virtual try-on experiences with friends and family.
