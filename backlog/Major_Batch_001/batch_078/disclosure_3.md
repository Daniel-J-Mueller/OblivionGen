## Secure Attestation-Based Dynamic Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Leverage the secure enclave technology described in the patent to create a dynamic resource allocation system where resource access (CPU, memory, network) isn't *granted* at instance launch, but *continuously verified* based on real-time attestation of the system's security posture. This goes beyond simply verifying the initial state; it monitors for runtime compromises and dynamically adjusts resource availability.

**Specification:**

**1. Attestation Agent:**

*   Resides within the enclave.
*   Continuously monitors key system metrics:
    *   Integrity of critical system files (verified against a known good hash).
    *   Runtime detection of rootkits/malware (using techniques like system call monitoring).
    *   Configuration drift (changes to security-relevant settings).
    *   Memory integrity checks.
*   Generates an attestation report containing these metrics.
*   Digitally signs the report using the enclave's key.
*   Periodically transmits the report to a central Attestation Service.

**Pseudocode (Attestation Agent - simplified):**

```
loop:
    integrity_check_result = verify_file_integrity()
    malware_detected = detect_malware()
    config_drift_detected = detect_config_drift()
    memory_integrity_ok = verify_memory_integrity()

    attestation_data = {
        "integrity": integrity_check_result,
        "malware": malware_detected,
        "config_drift": config_drift_detected,
        "memory_integrity": memory_integrity_ok
    }

    signed_report = sign(attestation_data, enclave_private_key)

    transmit(signed_report, Attestation_Service_Address)

    sleep(Attestation_Interval)
```

**2. Attestation Service:**

*   Receives signed attestation reports.
*   Verifies the signature using the corresponding public key.
*   Evaluates the attestation data against defined security policies.
*   Communicates resource allocation instructions to a Resource Manager.

**3. Resource Manager:**

*   Receives resource allocation instructions from the Attestation Service.
*   Dynamically adjusts resource availability for the monitored instance:
    *   Reduce CPU/Memory allocation if security violations are detected.
    *   Throttle or block network access.
    *   Completely isolate the instance in severe cases.
*   Utilizes hypervisor APIs (e.g., hypercalls) to enforce resource restrictions.

**4. Policy Engine:**

*   Defines the security policies used by the Attestation Service.
*   Allows administrators to customize resource allocation rules based on specific security threats.
*   Supports a rule-based language for expressing complex policies.

**Communication Flow:**

1.  Instance launches, Attestation Agent initializes.
2.  Attestation Agent continuously monitors system security posture.
3.  Attestation Agent generates signed attestation reports.
4.  Attestation Service verifies signatures and evaluates attestation data against defined policies.
5.  Attestation Service sends resource allocation instructions to Resource Manager.
6.  Resource Manager enforces resource restrictions using hypervisor APIs.
7.  Loop repeats.

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond static attestation (verifying initial state). It provides continuous runtime security monitoring and dynamic resource allocation, creating a self-defending infrastructure where resources are *earned* through ongoing security compliance. It introduces a feedback loop where security posture directly impacts resource availability.
