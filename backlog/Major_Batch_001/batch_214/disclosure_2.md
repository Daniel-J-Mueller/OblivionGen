**Dynamic Request Shaping & Predictive Resource Allocation**

**Core Concept:** Extend the asynchronous processing framework to *proactively* shape incoming requests based on real-time system load and predicted resource availability, dynamically adjusting request complexity or deferring non-critical components.

**Specification:**

1.  **Request Profiler Module:**
    *   Intercepts all incoming requests at the frontend task engine.
    *   Analyzes request parameters, data size, and estimated processing requirements (CPU, memory, I/O).
    *   Assigns a “complexity score” to each request.
    *   Maintains a rolling average of request complexity over time.

2.  **System Load Monitor:**
    *   Continuously monitors resource utilization across all compute and storage nodes.
    *   Tracks metrics like CPU usage, memory pressure, disk I/O, network latency.
    *   Calculates a “system health score” reflecting overall resource availability.

3.  **Predictive Resource Allocator:**
    *   Combines the request complexity score and system health score to determine an “acceptance threshold”.
    *   If a request's complexity score exceeds the acceptance threshold:
        *   **Option A: Request Decomposition:**  Break down the request into smaller, independent sub-requests. Each sub-request is assigned a lower complexity score.  These can be processed asynchronously.
        *   **Option B: Feature Suppression:** Identify non-essential features or data within the request. Suppress these features to reduce processing load.  A flag is set indicating the suppressed features.
        *   **Option C: Deferred Processing:**  Queue the request for processing during off-peak hours or when resources become available.  Assign a priority based on the request type and user.

4.  **Dynamic Task Prioritization:**
    *   Prioritizes tasks based on the original request type, user priority, and any applied shaping decisions (decomposition, suppression, deferral).
    *   Backend task engines dynamically adjust processing order based on these priorities.

5.  **Client-Side Adaptation Protocol:**
    *   Frontend task engine communicates shaping decisions to the client.
    *   For suppressed features, the client can either proceed without them or request a retry during a period of higher resource availability.
    *   For decomposed requests, the client receives results incrementally as sub-requests complete.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Resource Allocator):**

```
FUNCTION EvaluateRequest(request):
  complexity_score = CalculateComplexityScore(request)
  system_health_score = MonitorSystemHealth()
  acceptance_threshold = CalculateAcceptanceThreshold(system_health_score)

  IF complexity_score > acceptance_threshold:
    shaping_decision = DetermineShapingDecision(request, complexity_score)
    ApplyShapingDecision(request, shaping_decision)
    RETURN shaped_request
  ELSE:
    RETURN request

FUNCTION DetermineShapingDecision(request, complexity_score):
  // Prioritize decomposition, then suppression, then deferral
  IF CanDecompose(request):
    RETURN "decompose"
  ELSE IF CanSuppressFeatures(request):
    RETURN "suppress"
  ELSE:
    RETURN "defer"
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   Machine learning models can be used to improve the accuracy of complexity score calculation and acceptance threshold determination.
*   Integration with existing monitoring and alerting systems.
*   Support for different shaping strategies based on request type and user preferences.
