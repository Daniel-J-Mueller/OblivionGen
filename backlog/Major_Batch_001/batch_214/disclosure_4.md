## Dynamic Light Field Reconstruction with Per-Pixel Depth-Aware Rendering

**Concept:** Extend depth encoding beyond simple steganography into a dynamic light field reconstruction system. Instead of *just* embedding depth, utilize the encoded depth information as control parameters for rendering a dynamic light field. This allows for viewpoint shifting *after* image capture, creating a pseudo-3D effect without requiring complex multi-camera setups.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Two sensors. A standard RGB sensor and a high-resolution depth sensor (Time-of-Flight or structured light). These sensors *must* be hardware synchronized.
*   **Encoding Scheme:** Employ a variable bitrate depth encoding scheme. Areas of high depth variation require more bits, while flat surfaces need fewer.  Prioritize encoding *gradients* in the depth map, rather than absolute depth values. The least significant bits of color channels (R,G,B) will be used, but with adaptive allocation.
*   **Data Storage:**  Store the encoded RGB image alongside the raw depth map. The raw depth map serves as a reference and for potential error correction/enhancement.
*   **Rendering Engine – Light Field Generation:**
    *   **Input:** Encoded RGB image, Raw Depth Map.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Decode the depth information from the encoded RGB image.
        2.  Establish a virtual camera position. This is the "new" viewpoint.
        3.  For each pixel in the desired output image:
            *   Use the decoded depth value for that pixel.
            *   Calculate the ray direction from the virtual camera through that pixel and the corresponding point in 3D space (based on depth).
            *   Perform a ray trace against the original RGB image, weighted by the proximity of the ray intersection to the pixel’s original location. This effectively "shifts" the viewpoint.
            *   This is a per-pixel calculation, enabling smooth viewpoint shifts.
        4.  Implement an occlusion culling algorithm based on the depth map to avoid rendering obscured objects.
*   **Software API:** A software library for controlling the virtual camera position, rendering the light field, and accessing the underlying depth data. API functions:
    *   `SetCameraPosition(x, y, z)`: Sets the position of the virtual camera.
    *   `RenderLightField(output_image)`: Renders the light field to the specified output image.
    *   `GetDepthMap()`: Returns the decoded depth map.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Implement the rendering engine on a GPU with dedicated hardware for ray tracing and depth map processing.
*   **Pseudocode – RenderLightField function:**

```pseudocode
function RenderLightField(encoded_image, depth_map, camera_position, output_image):
    decoded_depth_map = DecodeDepth(encoded_image)

    for each pixel in output_image:
        x, y = pixel coordinates
        ray_direction = CalculateRayDirection(x, y, camera_position, decoded_depth_map[x, y])
        
        intersection_point = FindClosestPixelInOriginalImage(ray_direction)

        output_image[x, y] = intersection_point.color
        
    return output_image
```

*   **Refinements:**  
    *   Implement a depth map smoothing algorithm to reduce noise and artifacts.
    *   Develop a method for encoding additional metadata, such as lighting information, into the depth map.
    *   Explore the use of neural networks to enhance the quality of the rendered light field.
