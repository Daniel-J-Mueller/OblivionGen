## Dynamic Email Thread ‘Bubbles’ & Contextual AI Summarization

**Concept:** Extend the linked email conversation functionality with a visually dynamic, ‘bubble’ based interface, coupled with AI-powered contextual summarization delivered *within* the email client.

**Specification:**

**1. Visual Interface – ‘Bubble’ Network:**

*   **Core:** The email client displays linked conversations not as simple lists, but as interconnected ‘bubbles’ floating within the main view. Bubble size corresponds to conversation length (number of emails).
*   **Connection Logic:** Bubbles representing linked conversations are visually connected by lines. Line thickness indicates the strength of the link - calculated by frequency of shared participants *and* semantic similarity of email content.
*   **Dynamic Positioning:** Bubbles are not static. They subtly ‘attract’ or ‘repel’ each other based on link strength and recent user interaction. Frequent interactions pull bubbles closer, infrequent interactions push them apart.  A ‘gravity’ well based on user-defined priority tags (e.g., ‘Project Alpha’, ‘Urgent’) keeps key conversations anchored.
*   **Zoom/Filter:** Users can zoom in/out and filter the bubble network by sender, recipient, keywords, tags, or time frame.

**2. Contextual AI Summarization – ‘Insight Panels’:**

*   **Trigger:** When a user selects a bubble (a linked conversation), an ‘Insight Panel’ slides out.  This panel *doesn’t* just provide a summary of the entire thread, but rather dynamically generates summaries *relevant to the user’s current context*.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  The AI considers:
    *   The user’s calendar events (e.g., meetings related to the thread).
    *   Recently viewed documents (e.g., files shared in the thread).
    *   The user’s current task list (integration with task management apps).
    *   The user’s role within the organization (access control for sensitive information).
*   **Summary Types:**
    *   **Action Items:** Extracted tasks, deadlines, and assigned owners.
    *   **Key Decisions:** Summarized conclusions reached within the thread.
    *   **Risk Assessment:**  Identified potential issues and mitigation strategies.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Overall tone of the conversation (positive, negative, neutral).
*   **Interactive Summary:**  Users can click on elements within the summary to jump directly to the relevant email within the thread.

**3. Pseudocode – Insight Panel Generation:**

```
function generateInsightPanel(emailThread, userContext) {
  // 1. Extract relevant information from emailThread
  emails = getAllEmailsInThread(emailThread)
  decisions = extractDecisions(emails)
  tasks = extractTasks(emails)
  risks = identifyRisks(emails)
  sentiment = analyzeSentiment(emails)

  // 2. Filter information based on userContext
  filteredDecisions = filterDecisionsByUserRole(decisions, userContext.role)
  relevantTasks = findTasksForCurrentUser(tasks, userContext.userId)

  // 3. Create summary sections
  decisionSection = createSection("Key Decisions", filteredDecisions)
  taskSection = createSection("Action Items", relevantTasks)
  riskSection = createSection("Potential Risks", riskSection)
  sentimentSection = createSection("Overall Sentiment", sentiment)

  // 4. Return combined Insight Panel
  return combineSections([decisionSection, taskSection, riskSection, sentimentSection])
}

function createSection(title, content) {
  // Generate HTML/UI element for section
  // Include title and content
  return sectionElement
}
```

**4. API Integration:**

*   AI summarization service: Access via REST API.
*   Calendar & Task Management Apps: OAuth integration.
*   Internal Knowledge Base: Integration for linking thread content to relevant documentation.
