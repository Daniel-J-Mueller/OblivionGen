## Dynamic Network Document Reconstruction for Predictive Testing

**Specification:** A system to dynamically reconstruct network documents (web pages, APIs, etc.) in a simulated environment *before* launching crawlers for testing. This aims to identify potential issues proactively, reduce crawler execution time, and enable testing of configurations *before* they are live.

**Components:**

1.  **Reconstruction Engine:**  A module that fetches the live network document and transforms it into a local, editable representation. This goes beyond simple caching. It involves:
    *   Resolving all external dependencies (CSS, JS, images, APIs) and storing them locally.
    *   Rendering the document into a DOM-like structure.
    *   Identifying dynamic content loading mechanisms (JavaScript-driven fetches, WebSockets, etc.).
    *   Simulating the environment.

2.  **State Management Layer:**  A system for capturing and replaying the "state" of the reconstructed document. This includes:
    *   Cookie values.
    *   Local Storage/Session Storage data.
    *   Any server-side state that influences rendering (user roles, feature flags).
    *   Simulated network conditions (latency, bandwidth).

3.  **Predictive Testing Module:**  A component that executes a subset of the intended tests *within* the reconstructed environment *before* launching a live crawler. This involves:
    *   Static analysis of the reconstructed DOM.
    *   Execution of JavaScript code in a simulated browser environment.
    *   Mocking external API calls.
    *   Identifying potential errors (broken links, invalid input fields, JavaScript exceptions).
    *   Generating a "risk assessment" score for the document.

4.  **Crawler Orchestration:**  The existing crawler system, modified to:
    *   Receive the risk assessment score from the Predictive Testing Module.
    *   Prioritize crawling based on the risk score (higher risk = higher priority).
    *   Dynamically adjust the scope of the crawler run (e.g., focus on areas identified as high-risk).
    *   Receive a pre-populated DOM state from the reconstruction engine for faster initial loading.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Reconstruction Engine
function reconstructDocument(url, initial_state) {
  document = fetchAndRender(url);
  dependencies = resolveDependencies(document);
  storeLocally(dependencies);
  simulated_environment = createEnvironment(initial_state);
  return simulated_environment, document;
}

// Predictive Testing Module
function predictErrors(simulated_environment, document, test_suite) {
  static_analysis_results = performStaticAnalysis(document);
  js_execution_results = executeJavaScript(document, test_suite, simulated_environment);
  error_list = combineResults(static_analysis_results, js_execution_results);
  risk_score = calculateRiskScore(error_list);
  return risk_score, error_list;
}

// Crawler Orchestration
function orchestrateCrawler(url, test_document) {
  simulated_environment, document = reconstructDocument(url);
  risk_score, error_list = predictErrors(simulated_environment, document, test_document);
  crawler = selectCrawler(test_document);
  crawler.setInitialState(simulated_environment); //Pre-populate state
  crawler.setPriority(risk_score);
  launchCrawler(crawler, url);
}
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simply caching or mirroring a web page. It creates a *fully functional, simulated* environment that allows for proactive testing and risk assessment *before* a live crawler is launched. This is particularly valuable for complex, dynamic web applications or for testing potentially unstable configurations. The simulated environment allows for controlled experimentation and reduces the risk of impacting live systems. The pre-populated initial state significantly accelerates crawler execution and improves efficiency.
