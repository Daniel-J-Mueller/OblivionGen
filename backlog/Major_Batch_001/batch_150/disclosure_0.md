## Decentralized Key Shard Management for Authentication

**Concept:** Extend the secure credential handling beyond a single client-side security module. Instead of storing the entire client key locally, split it into multiple "key shards" distributed across trusted, but geographically diverse, edge nodes. This significantly reduces the risk associated with a single point of compromise.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Shard Generation & Distribution:**

*   **Initialization:** Upon initial authentication request (or user onboarding), a Key Derivation Function (KDF) generates the client key.
*   **Sharding:** The KDF output (client key) is algorithmically divided into *n* key shards.  *n* is configurable (e.g., 3-5 shards).
*   **Edge Node Selection:** A trusted network of edge nodes is maintained. Nodes are selected based on proximity to the user, network latency, and reputation scores.  Selection is dynamic and can change with each authentication cycle.
*   **Shard Encryption:** Each shard is individually encrypted using a public key associated with its designated edge node.
*   **Shard Distribution:** Encrypted shards are distributed to their respective edge nodes.  A "Shard Map" (containing edge node identifiers and associated shard metadata) is generated and encrypted using the server key.

**2. Authentication Flow:**

*   **Request Initiation:** Client initiates authentication request.
*   **Shard Map Retrieval:** The encrypted Shard Map is sent to the client.
*   **Shard Request:** Client decrypts the Shard Map and initiates requests to each edge node for its shard.
*   **Shard Retrieval & Reassembly:** Edge nodes respond with their encrypted shards. Client decrypts shards using its locally stored secret/credentials.
*   **Key Reassembly:** Client reassembles the key from the individual shards.
*   **Signature Verification:** Client signs the request using the reassembled key.
*   **Transmission & Verification:** Signed request (plus original Shard Map) is sent to the Web Service. The Web Service verifies the signature.

**3. Security Module Functionality:**

*   The client-side security module *does not* store the complete client key.
*   It stores only the necessary decryption credentials/secrets for retrieving and decrypting the key shards, and the server key.
*   Security module acts as a coordinator for shard retrieval and reassembly.

**4.  Key Rotation & Revocation:**

*   Key shards and the server key are periodically rotated.
*   Revocation process involves invalidating specific shards and initiating a new key generation cycle.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function authenticate():
  shard_map_encrypted = receive_shard_map()
  shard_map = decrypt(shard_map_encrypted, server_key)

  shards = []
  for each node, shard_info in shard_map:
    shard_encrypted = request_shard(node, shard_info)
    shard = decrypt(shard_encrypted, local_secret)
    shards.append(shard)

  client_key = reassemble_key(shards)

  signature = sign(request_data, client_key)

  send(request_data, signature, shard_map)
```

**Infrastructure Considerations:**

*   A distributed and highly available network of edge nodes is required.
*   Robust key management and rotation mechanisms are essential.
*   The system must be resilient to node failures and network disruptions.
*   Edge node reputation scoring system to prevent malicious node participation.
