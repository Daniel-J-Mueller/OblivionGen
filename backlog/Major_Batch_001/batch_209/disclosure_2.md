## Dynamic Object-Aware Panning & Magnification with Predictive Behavioral Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the panoramic panning/magnification system to *predict* user focus and dynamically adjust rendering to prioritize perceived areas of interest *before* the user explicitly interacts with them. This goes beyond simply following touch input; it anticipates intent.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Panoramic video data, user touch input (as in the reference patent), *real-time object detection/classification data* (from onboard or remote processing - people, animals, cars, buildings, significant landmarks), and *historical user behavioral data* (dwell time on objects, common panning/magnification patterns).
*   **Object Detection & Classification Module:** Integrated or external module utilizing computer vision to identify and categorize objects within the panoramic video frame. Outputs object bounding boxes, classification scores, and confidence levels.
*   **Behavioral Modeling Module:** Machine learning model trained on historical user data to predict areas of interest. This model will consider:
    *   Object Type: (e.g., users are more likely to focus on faces than buildings).
    *   Object Salience: (size, contrast, motion).
    *   Contextual Information: (relationships between objects, scene type).
    *   User History: (individual preferences, past interactions).
*   **Predictive Rendering Engine:**
    *   Utilizes object detection, behavioral modeling, and current user input to generate a “heat map” of predicted areas of interest.
    *   Dynamically adjusts rendering quality (resolution, detail) to prioritize these areas *before* explicit user interaction.
    *   Implements a subtle, anticipatory panning/magnification effect to gently guide the user's attention towards these areas.
    *   Calculates Bézier control points based not only on user input but also on the predicted areas of interest, weighted by confidence scores from the behavioral model.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Panoramic video data is ingested.
    2.  Object Detection & Classification module analyzes the video frame.
    3.  Behavioral Modeling module predicts areas of interest.
    4.  Predictive Rendering Engine calculates Bézier control points and generates panning/magnification curves, blending user input with predictive data.
    5.  Rendered video clip is displayed.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Rendering Engine - Control Point Calculation):**

```
function calculateControlPoints(userInputData, predictedInterestData, currentFrame):
  // userInputData: Bézier control points based solely on touch input.
  // predictedInterestData:  Object bounding boxes, salience scores, and predicted gaze points.

  // Weighting factors (tunable parameters)
  userWeight = 0.7  // Prioritize user input
  predictionWeight = 0.3 // Influence of predictive data

  // Combine user and predicted control points
  combinedControlPoints = []

  for i in range(len(userInputData)):
    // Calculate influence of predictive data for this control point
    influence = 0.0

    for obj in predictedInterestData:
      // Check if object is near the current control point
      if distance(obj.center, userInputData[i].position) < threshold:
        influence += obj.salience * weightingFactor  // Adjust based on salience

    // Blend user and predictive data
    predictedControlPoint = userInputData[i] + influence * getPredictiveOffset(obj.center)

    combinedControlPoint = (userWeight * userInputData[i]) + (predictionWeight * predictedControlPoint)

    combinedControlPoints.append(combinedControlPoint)

  return combinedControlPoints
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems react to user input. This system *anticipates* it, proactively enhancing the viewing experience. The integration of behavioral modeling and predictive rendering is a significant advancement. This allows for a more fluid, immersive, and intuitive interaction with panoramic video content.
