## Dynamic Workflow Composition with Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the stateless workflow evaluation described in the patent by introducing a dynamic workflow composition engine alongside a predictive resource allocation system. The system proactively anticipates future workflow stages, composes optimized execution paths, and pre-allocates resources *before* the workflow explicitly requests them. This shifts the paradigm from reactive decision-making to proactive orchestration.

**Specifications:**

**1. Workflow Definition & Composition Language (WDCL):**

*   A declarative language extending existing workflow definitions to include ‘potential paths’ – anticipated sequences of tasks based on probabilistic outcomes.
*   WDCL allows defining cost functions for each potential path (e.g., estimated execution time, resource consumption).
*   It includes a ‘horizon’ parameter defining how many steps ahead the composition engine should plan.

**2. Predictive Engine:**

*   A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, Bayesian network) trained on historical workflow execution data.
*   Input: Current workflow state (as represented in the workflow log), workflow definition, historical execution data.
*   Output: Probability distribution over potential paths for the next ‘horizon’ steps.  Cost estimates for each path.

**3. Dynamic Composition Service:**

*   Receives the probability distribution and cost estimates from the Predictive Engine.
*   Implements a cost-optimization algorithm (e.g., A*, dynamic programming) to determine the most cost-effective execution path for the next few steps.
*   Generates a revised workflow definition reflecting the chosen path.
*   Interfaces with the Resource Allocation Service.

**4. Resource Allocation Service:**

*   Receives the revised workflow definition and requests resource allocation *in advance* for the tasks in the chosen path.
*   Uses a cluster management system (e.g., Kubernetes, Mesos) to provision the necessary resources (CPU, memory, GPU, network).
*   Implements a resource reservation system to ensure that resources are available when needed.
*   Monitors resource utilization and adjusts allocations dynamically.

**5. Workflow Evaluation Service Adaptation:**

*   Modified to accept pre-allocated resources as input.
*   Executes tasks on the pre-allocated resources.
*   Reports resource utilization and performance metrics to the Resource Allocation Service.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Composition Service):**

```
function composeWorkflow(currentWorkflowState, workflowDefinition):
  potentialPaths = PredictiveEngine.predictPaths(currentWorkflowState, workflowDefinition)
  
  bestPath = null
  minCost = infinity
  
  for path in potentialPaths:
    cost = path.estimatedCost  //Using cost function within WDCL
    if cost < minCost:
      minCost = cost
      bestPath = path
  
  revisedWorkflowDefinition = updateWorkflowDefinition(workflowDefinition, bestPath)
  
  ResourceAllocationService.allocateResources(revisedWorkflowDefinition)
  
  return revisedWorkflowDefinition
```

**Innovation Rationale:**

The core innovation lies in shifting from reactive task scheduling to proactive workflow orchestration. By predicting future workflow stages and pre-allocating resources, we can significantly reduce latency, improve resource utilization, and enhance scalability. This is particularly beneficial for complex, long-running workflows with highly variable execution paths. It allows the system to anticipate bottlenecks and proactively address them, ensuring a smoother and more efficient execution experience.
