## Magnetic Field Resonance Communication

**Concept:** Utilize multiple, strategically placed magnetic beacons operating at slightly *different* frequencies. A user device's magnetometer doesn't simply detect on/off states, but analyzes the *resonance* patterns created by the overlapping fields. This allows for a significantly higher data transmission rate and more complex messaging than simple activation/deactivation.

**Specs:**

*   **Beacon Hardware:** Each beacon consists of a core electromagnet and a frequency modulation (FM) circuit.  The FM circuit allows the beacon to subtly shift its magnetic field frequency within a narrow band (e.g., 10-20 Hz).  Power source: Rechargeable battery, ideally with wireless charging capability. Physical size:  Approximately 3cm diameter, 1cm height.  Enclosure: Durable, weatherproof plastic.
*   **User Device Software:**
    *   **Resonance Analysis Engine:** Core component.  Processes raw magnetometer data, performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to identify dominant frequencies present in the magnetic field.
    *   **Frequency Mapping Database:**  Stores the assigned frequencies for each beacon.  Allows the software to identify *which* beacon is transmitting.
    *   **Modulation Decoding:**  Interprets subtle shifts in frequency *within* the assigned band.  These shifts represent data bits.  Example: A 10Hz beacon, shifting to 10.1Hz = ‘0’, 10.2Hz = ‘1’.
    *   **Error Correction:**  Includes a robust error correction algorithm (e.g., Reed-Solomon) to mitigate interference and signal degradation.
    *   **Signal Filtering:** Applies digital filtering to reduce noise and improve signal clarity.

*   **Communication Protocol:**
    1.  **Beacon Synchronization:** Beacons broadcast a short synchronization signal at a known frequency to establish timing.
    2.  **Frequency Assignment:** Each beacon is assigned a unique base frequency.
    3.  **Data Transmission:** Beacons modulate their frequency according to the data being transmitted.
    4.  **User Device Detection:** The user device’s magnetometer detects the combined magnetic field. The Resonance Analysis Engine identifies each beacon’s frequency and decodes the modulated data.
    5.  **Data Reconstruction:** The decoded data is reassembled into a meaningful message.

*   **Pseudocode (User Device):**

```
function analyzeMagnetometerData():
    raw_data = getMagnetometerReading()
    fft_result = performFFT(raw_data)
    frequencies = extractDominantFrequencies(fft_result)

    identified_beacons = []
    for frequency in frequencies:
        beacon = findBeaconByFrequency(frequency, beacon_database)
        if beacon:
            identified_beacons.append(beacon)

    decoded_data = ""
    for beacon in identified_beacons:
        modulation = decodeModulation(beacon.frequency, raw_data)
        decoded_data += modulation

    return decoded_data
```

*   **Advanced Feature - Spatial Encoding:** Employ varying beacon density and/or intensity to encode additional information relating to location or proximity. Higher density/intensity = closer proximity to source. This can provide sub-meter accuracy.

*   **Potential Applications:** Indoor positioning, secure authentication, proximity-based marketing, data transfer in environments where radio waves are blocked or undesirable.
