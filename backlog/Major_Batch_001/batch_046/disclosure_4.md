## Adaptive Aerodynamic Control Surface Mapping via Distributed Pressure Sensing

**Concept:** Integrate a network of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) pressure sensors *directly* into the skin of the UAVâ€™s control surfaces (ailerons, elevators, rudders). These sensors, coupled with a real-time processing unit, will create a dynamic, high-resolution map of airflow across the surfaces *during* flight. This data will be fed into an adaptive control algorithm that subtly morphs the control surface geometry via integrated micro-actuators (shape memory alloys or piezoelectric elements) to optimize aerodynamic performance and minimize drag.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Network:**
    *   Density: Minimum 1 sensor per 10cm<sup>2</sup> of control surface area.
    *   Type: MEMS piezoresistive pressure sensors (target sensitivity: 1 Pa).
    *   Communication: Wireless mesh network (Bluetooth Low Energy preferred) to a central processing unit.
    *   Power: Energy harvesting via flexible piezoelectric generators integrated into the control surface skin, supplemented by UAV battery power.
*   **Control Surface Actuation:**
    *   Type: Array of micro-actuators (shape memory alloy wires or piezoelectric stacks) embedded beneath the control surface skin.
    *   Resolution: Actuators spaced at approximately 5cm intervals.
    *   Deflection: Maximum actuator deflection of 2mm.
    *   Control: Closed-loop control based on pressure sensor data and a pre-defined aerodynamic performance model.
*   **Processing Unit:**
    *   Processor: Low-power ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller.
    *   Memory: 256MB RAM, 64MB Flash.
    *   Communication: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, UAV CAN bus interface.
    *   Algorithms:
        *   Real-time data acquisition and processing.
        *   Aerodynamic model integration.
        *   Adaptive control algorithm (e.g., Model Predictive Control).
        *   Fault detection and isolation.
*   **System Integration:**
    *   Control surface skin: Flexible, durable polymer composite with embedded sensors and actuators.
    *   Wiring: Flexible, shielded cables.
    *   Power supply: Regulated DC-DC converter.
    *   Mounting: Lightweight, vibration-dampening mounts.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Control Algorithm):**

```
// Initialization
Load Aerodynamic Performance Model
Initialize Sensor Network
Initialize Actuator Network

// Main Loop
For Each Time Step:
    // 1. Acquire Sensor Data
    Read Pressure Values from Sensor Network

    // 2. Calculate Control Surfaces Required to Maximize Aerodynamic Performance (given inputs from UAV flight controller)
    Calculate Target Pressure Distribution (based on performance model & UAV inputs)
    Calculate Error (Difference between actual & target pressure)

    // 3. Map Error to Actuator Commands
    For Each Actuator:
        Calculate Actuation Command (based on error in its local region)

    // 4. Send Commands to Actuators
    Send Actuation Commands to Actuator Network

    // 5. Monitor System Health (for sensor and actuator failures)
    Check Sensor Status
    Check Actuator Status
    Log Errors & Failures

End Loop
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simple control surface deflection to *dynamic shaping* of the control surface based on real-time airflow data. The distributed sensor network and integrated actuation create a truly adaptive aerodynamic system, enabling optimized flight performance and reduced drag. The system also allows for in-flight damage detection (e.g., a failed actuator or sensor).
