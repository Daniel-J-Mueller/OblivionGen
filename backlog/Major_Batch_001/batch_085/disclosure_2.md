## Dynamic File Shadowing with Predictive Pre-Fetch

**Concept:** Extend the modification listener concept to create “file shadows” – lightweight, constantly updated representations of file state *before* changes are committed. This allows for predictive pre-fetching and near-instantaneous rollback/diffing, enhancing collaborative workflows and data resilience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow Creation & Maintenance:**

*   **Trigger:** When a file is opened for editing (or a modification listener is attached), a “shadow file” is created. This shadow file is stored in a temporary, high-speed storage tier (e.g., RAM disk, NVMe SSD).
*   **Update Mechanism:**  Instead of waiting for a full file write, the system intercepts *all* write operations at the file system level. Changes are immediately applied to both the primary file and the shadow file.  This utilizes a copy-on-write mechanism.  Small changes can be handled in-memory, larger changes are written to both locations.
*   **Versioning:** Each shadow file maintains a version counter.  This is incremented with each write operation, allowing for granular tracking of changes.
*   **Metadata:**  Associated metadata includes:
    *   User ID initiating the edit.
    *   Timestamp of last modification.
    *   Checksum of shadow file.
    *   Pointer to the primary file.

**2. Predictive Pre-Fetch:**

*   **Analysis Engine:**  A background process analyzes user editing patterns (e.g., typing speed, common operations).
*   **Prediction:** Based on the analysis, the system predicts which sections of the file the user is likely to access next.
*   **Pre-Fetch:**  The predicted sections are proactively loaded from the primary file into the shadow file, minimizing latency. This utilizes a cache-aware prefetcher.

**3.  Rollback & Diffing:**

*   **Rollback:** If the user requests a rollback, the system simply discards the shadow file and reverts to the primary file.  This is near-instantaneous.
*   **Diffing:**  A dedicated diff engine compares the shadow file with the primary file to generate a patch.  This patch can be used for:
    *   Collaboration:  Sharing changes with other users.
    *   Version Control:  Committing changes to a version control system.

**4. System Components:**

*   **File System Interceptor:**  Low-level driver/kernel module intercepts file I/O.
*   **Shadow Manager:**  Manages shadow file creation, maintenance, and deletion.
*   **Analysis Engine:**  Predicts user editing patterns.
*   **Diff Engine:**  Generates patches.
*   **Configuration Data:**
    *   List of files to monitor.
    *   Threshold for triggering pre-fetch.
    *   Storage tier for shadow files.
    *   User-specific settings.

**5. Pseudocode (Shadow Manager – Update File):**

```
function UpdateFile(fileID, data, offset):
  // Obtain lock on file
  LockFile(fileID)

  // Create shadow file if it doesn't exist
  if (ShadowFileDoesNotExist(fileID)):
    CreateShadowFile(fileID)

  // Write data to primary file
  WriteToPrimaryFile(fileID, data, offset)

  // Write data to shadow file
  WriteToShadowFile(fileID, data, offset)

  // Increment version counter
  IncrementVersionCounter(fileID)

  // Release lock
  ReleaseFileLock(fileID)

end function
```

**Novelty:**

This concept extends the existing modification listener by proactively creating a shadow file that is kept in sync with the primary file. This enables near-instantaneous rollback, predictive pre-fetching, and enhanced collaboration.  The use of predictive pre-fetch based on user editing patterns is a key differentiator. It is a radical departure from simply reacting to file modifications.
