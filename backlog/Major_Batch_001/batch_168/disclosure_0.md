## Adaptive Endpointing with Prosodic Feature Weighting

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple non-speech duration weighting to incorporate prosodic features (pitch, energy, speaking rate) *within* the weighted duration calculation, creating a more nuanced endpoint detection system. The core idea is that endpoints aren’t solely marked by silence, but by a shift in *how* speech is delivered – a flattening of prosody, a drop in energy, or a slowing of rate.

**Specs:**

1.  **Prosodic Feature Extraction Module:**
    *   Input: Raw audio data.
    *   Output: Time-aligned vectors representing:
        *   Fundamental frequency (F0) – estimated using YIN or similar algorithm.
        *   Root Mean Square Energy (RMSE) – calculated per frame.
        *   Speaking Rate – measured as syllable density or phoneme density per second.

2.  **Hypothesis-Weighted Prosodic Feature Calculation:**
    *   Input: ASR hypotheses (as in the provided patent), prosodic feature vectors, hypothesis probabilities.
    *   Process: For each hypothesis and each audio frame:
        *   Scale the prosodic feature vector (F0, RMSE, Speaking Rate) by the hypothesis probability.  This prioritizes prosodic features from more likely hypotheses.
        *   Calculate a "prosodic deviation score" for each feature:  `deviation = abs(feature_value - moving_average(feature_value))`
        *   Sum the weighted deviation scores across all prosodic features to create a single "prosodic score" per hypothesis and per frame.

3.  **Combined Endpoint Score Calculation:**
    *   Input:  Non-speech duration weighted scores (from the original patent), hypothesis-weighted prosodic scores.
    *   Process:
        *   Combine the non-speech duration score and the prosodic score using a weighted sum: `endpoint_score = (weight_non_speech * non_speech_score) + (weight_prosody * prosodic_score)`
        *   `weight_non_speech` and `weight_prosody` are tunable parameters, allowing adjustment based on the specific application and environment.

4.  **Adaptive Thresholding:**
    *   Instead of a fixed threshold, employ a dynamic threshold based on a moving average of the `endpoint_score`.  This adapts to variations in speaking style and background noise.
    *   Threshold = `moving_average(endpoint_score) + (scaling_factor * standard_deviation(endpoint_score))`
    *   `scaling_factor` controls the sensitivity of the endpoint detection.

5.  **Endpoint Declaration:**
    *   Declare an endpoint when the `endpoint_score` exceeds the dynamic threshold for a specified duration (e.g., 2-3 consecutive frames).
    *   Implement hysteresis to prevent rapid endpoint toggling.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each Hypothesis
for hypothesis in hypotheses:
    // For each Frame
    for frame in audio_frames:
        // Extract Prosodic Features
        f0 = extract_f0(frame)
        rmse = extract_rmse(frame)
        speaking_rate = extract_speaking_rate(frame)

        // Calculate Deviation Scores
        f0_deviation = abs(f0 - moving_average(f0))
        rmse_deviation = abs(rmse - moving_average(rmse))
        speaking_rate_deviation = abs(speaking_rate - moving_average(speaking_rate))

        // Calculate Weighted Prosodic Score
        prosodic_score = (hypothesis_probability * (f0_deviation + rmse_deviation + speaking_rate_deviation))

        // Calculate Non-Speech Score (from original patent)
        non_speech_score = ...

        // Combine Scores
        endpoint_score = (weight_non_speech * non_speech_score) + (weight_prosody * prosodic_score)

        // Compare to Adaptive Threshold
        if endpoint_score > adaptive_threshold:
            endpoint_frames.append(frame) //Or declare the endpoint.
```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   **Speaker Adaptation:**  Train speaker-specific prosodic models to improve accuracy.
*   **Contextual Analysis:**  Incorporate information about the surrounding text or dialogue to refine endpoint predictions.
*   **Feature Selection:**  Use machine learning to identify the most relevant prosodic features for endpoint detection in different scenarios.
