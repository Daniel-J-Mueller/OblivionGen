## Adaptive Result Granularity for Aggregation

**Concept:** The patent details probabilistic eviction based on reoccurrence probability. This suggests a fixed granularity of "partial aggregation results." We can dramatically improve efficiency by *dynamically* adjusting the granularity of these results based on data characteristics and storage pressure. Instead of evicting entire partial results, we can selectively evict *dimensions* or *subsets* of the data contributing to that result.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Structure – Multi-Dimensional Aggregation Cubes:**

*   Replace the “partial aggregation result” with a multi-dimensional aggregation cube.  Each dimension represents a grouping or filtering criterion applied during aggregation (e.g., product category, date range, customer segment).
*   The cube stores aggregated values for each combination of dimensions.  Think of a sparse matrix where most cells are zero.
*   Each cell within the cube represents an aggregation 'fragment.'

**2. Granularity Control Module:**

*   **Granularity Profiles:** Define pre-configured granularity levels (e.g., "coarse," "medium," "fine").  Each level specifies which dimensions are *active* (fully aggregated) and which are *collapsed* (aggregated to a higher level or excluded).
*   **Adaptive Granularity Algorithm:**  This algorithm continuously monitors:
    *   **Storage Pressure:** Available space in the result store.
    *   **Query Patterns:**  Which dimensions are most frequently used in queries.
    *   **Data Distribution:** How evenly data is distributed across dimensions.  (High variance suggests finer granularity is needed).
*   Based on these factors, the algorithm dynamically switches between granularity profiles.  

**3. Eviction Strategy – Dimensional Pruning:**

*   Instead of evicting entire partial results, the system *prunes* dimensions from the aggregation cube.
*   Dimensions are selected for pruning based on:
    *   **Least Frequently Used (LFU):**  Dimensions not present in recent queries.
    *   **Low Variance:**  Dimensions where aggregation values are relatively uniform (less information loss).
    *   **Granularity Profile:**  Dimensions explicitly excluded by the current profile.
*   Pruned dimensions are effectively removed from the result cube, reducing storage footprint.

**4. Reconstitution Mechanism:**

*   When a query requires data from a pruned dimension, the system can *reconstitute* the data on-demand.
*   This can be done by:
    *   **Re-aggregating:** Performing a partial aggregation from the base data. (Expensive, but accurate).
    *   **Approximation:**  Using statistical modeling to estimate the missing values. (Fast, but potentially less accurate).

**Pseudocode – Adaptive Granularity Algorithm:**

```
function adjustGranularity(storagePressure, queryPatterns, dataDistribution) {
  if (storagePressure > thresholdHigh) {
    granularityProfile = "coarse"  // Collapse most dimensions
  } else if (storagePressure > thresholdMedium) {
    granularityProfile = "medium" // Collapse some dimensions
  } else {
    granularityProfile = "fine"   // Use full granularity
  }

  // Prune dimensions based on granularityProfile and data characteristics.
  for each dimension in cube {
    if (granularityProfile excludes dimension) {
      pruneDimension(dimension)
    }
  }
}

function pruneDimension(dimension) {
  // Remove data associated with dimension from aggregation cube
  // Update metadata to indicate dimension is unavailable
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Storage Footprint:**  Significant storage savings by selectively discarding less important data.
*   **Improved Query Performance:**  Smaller result cubes lead to faster query processing.
*   **Adaptive Resource Utilization:**  Dynamically adjust resource allocation based on data characteristics and query workload.
*   **Increased Scalability:**  Handle larger datasets and more complex queries without exceeding storage limits.
