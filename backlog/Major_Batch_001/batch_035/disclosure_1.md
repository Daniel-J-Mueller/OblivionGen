## Dynamic Packet Prioritization via Predictive AI

**Concept:** Extend the packet queueing system to incorporate a predictive AI that dynamically adjusts prioritization *within* queues, not just between them, based on real-time application behavior and user interaction. This shifts from simple throttling to intelligent, anticipatory bandwidth allocation.

**Specifications:**

**1. AI Model – “Anticipatory Bandwidth Allocator” (ABA)**

*   **Input Data:**
    *   Packet characteristics (size, type, destination port, source IP)
    *   Application-level telemetry (CPU usage, memory consumption, network I/O) – gathered via a lightweight agent on the client VM.
    *   User interaction data (mouse movements, keystrokes, active window) – gathered via a privacy-respecting client agent.
    *   Historical bandwidth usage patterns for the application and user.
*   **Model Type:**  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) variant, optimized for time-series prediction.  Consider a hybrid approach with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction from packet data.
*   **Output:**  A priority score (0-100) for each packet, indicating its relative importance. This is *added* to the existing queue prioritization, not replacing it.

**2.  Queue Modification – “Adaptive Priority Queues”**

*   Existing packet queues are subdivided into multiple “priority tiers” within each category (e.g., web browsing, video streaming).  The number of tiers is configurable.
*   As packets enter a queue, the ABA assigns a priority score.  This score determines which tier the packet is placed in.
*   A weighted fair queuing algorithm is used *within* each tier to ensure no single flow monopolizes bandwidth.  The weights are configurable per tier, allowing for fine-grained control.

**3.  System Architecture**

*   **ABA Server:** A cluster of servers running the trained ABA model.  This provides scalability and redundancy.
*   **Node Agent:**  A lightweight agent running on each node that:
    *   Collects packet data and telemetry.
    *   Communicates with the ABA server to obtain priority scores.
    *   Manages the adaptive priority queues.
*   **Communication Protocol:** gRPC for high-performance communication between node agents and the ABA server.

**4. Pseudocode – Node Agent**

```
function processPacket(packet):
  telemetry = collectTelemetry()
  priorityScore = getPriorityScore(packet, telemetry)  // gRPC call to ABA Server

  tier = mapPriorityScoreToTier(priorityScore) //Configurable mapping

  addPacketToTierQueue(packet, tier)
```

**5. Training Data & Procedure**

*   **Data Collection:** Gather data from a diverse set of users and applications.  Include data under various network conditions (high latency, packet loss).
*   **Feature Engineering:**  Identify relevant features from packet data, telemetry, and user interaction data.
*   **Model Training:**  Train the RNN/CNN hybrid model using supervised learning.  The training objective is to predict the optimal packet prioritization to maximize user experience (e.g., minimize latency, maximize throughput).
*   **Continuous Learning:**  Retrain the model periodically with new data to adapt to changing application behavior and network conditions. Implement a feedback loop that incorporates user feedback (e.g., quality of service ratings).



**Innovation:** This design moves beyond simple rate limiting to a *predictive* system that anticipates application needs and dynamically allocates bandwidth. The integration of user interaction data provides a unique signal for improving user experience. The system allows for granular bandwidth control within established categories, optimizing resource allocation and responsiveness.
