## Adaptive Network ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the automated change management to not just react to failures *after* modification, but proactively ‘shadow’ changes in a parallel, low-impact environment, and predict potential issues *before* deployment to production. This system will predict problems and provide nuanced rollback options, or even suggest modified configurations based on the shadowing environment's data.

**Specs:**

*   **Shadow Environment Creation:** A system to automatically spin up a near-identical virtualized network environment mirroring the production network, using containerization or virtualization technologies. This shadow network receives a copy of the production network’s configuration (anonymized as needed for security).
*   **Configuration Replication:**  A mechanism to replicate proposed configuration changes *first* to the shadow environment, rather than directly to production. Changes are applied in a staged manner.
*   **Synthetic Traffic Generation:** A module to generate synthetic traffic mimicking typical production traffic patterns. This traffic is directed to the shadow environment to simulate real-world network load.  Traffic profiles are customizable, allowing for testing of peak loads, specific application traffic, or targeted scenarios.
*   **Performance & Anomaly Detection:** An integrated performance monitoring and anomaly detection system within the shadow environment.  Metrics collected include latency, throughput, packet loss, CPU utilization, memory usage, and application response times.  Machine learning algorithms identify deviations from baseline performance and flag potential issues.
*   **Predictive Rollback Module:** Before applying changes to production, the system analyzes the shadow environment data. If anomalies or performance degradation are detected, the module generates a ‘rollback readiness report’. This report details the potential impact of reverting the changes. It offers options beyond a simple rollback, such as:
    *   **Partial Rollback:** Reverting only specific parts of the configuration.
    *   **Modified Configuration:** Suggesting alternative configurations that address the identified issues.  This might involve adjusting parameters or applying different settings.
    *   **Staged Rollout:** Recommending a phased rollout to a limited subset of users or devices.
*   **Automated Rollback/Configuration Adjustment:** Based on pre-defined rules and thresholds, the system can automatically initiate a rollback or apply a modified configuration to production.
*   **Rollback Granularity Control**: Allow the user to specify granularity of the rollback operation. Options include: Rollback the entire change, rollback a specific section of the configuration, revert to a previous known working configuration.
*   **Integration with Existing Change Management System:** Seamless integration with the existing change management system, allowing for automated workflows and centralized control.
*    **Configuration Diff Engine**: A component to identify and visualize the differences between the original configuration, proposed changes and the final deployed configuration.

**Pseudocode (Rollback Decision Logic):**

```
function decideRollback(shadowEnvironmentData, thresholds):
  // Check for critical performance degradation
  if shadowEnvironmentData.latency > thresholds.maxLatency or
     shadowEnvironmentData.packetLoss > thresholds.maxPacketLoss:
    return "Rollback - Critical Performance Issue"

  // Check for anomalies in application response times
  if shadowEnvironmentData.applicationResponseTime > thresholds.maxResponseTime:
    return "Rollback - Application Performance Issue"

  // Check for configuration errors
  if shadowEnvironmentData.configurationErrors > 0:
    return "Rollback - Configuration Error"

  // If no critical issues, suggest modified configuration
  suggestedConfiguration = optimizeConfiguration(shadowEnvironmentData)
  return "Suggest Modified Configuration: " + suggestedConfiguration

  function optimizeConfiguration(shadowEnvironmentData):
    // Use machine learning algorithms to identify optimal settings
    // based on shadow environment data
    // Example: adjust buffer sizes, QoS settings, routing parameters
    return optimizedSettings
```
