## Dynamic Order Verification with Augmented Reality Overlay

**Concept:** Expand the visual verification system to incorporate Augmented Reality (AR) for a more robust and interactive customer experience. Instead of *just* static images or short videos, provide the customer with an AR experience that overlays shipping information *directly* onto a live view of the package.

**Specifications:**

**1. AR Application â€“ Customer Side:**

*   **Platform:** iOS & Android native application.
*   **Core Functionality:**  AR overlay triggered by scanning a unique QR code printed on the shipping label.
*   **AR Overlay Data:**
    *   **Item List:**  A dynamic list of items contained within the package, visually highlighted within the AR view.  (e.g., each item could have a bounding box).
    *   **Quantity Verification:** Displays the expected quantity of each item.
    *   **Damage Indicator:**  An AI-driven damage detection feature (see section 3).
    *   **Shipping Address Verification:**  Overlays the intended shipping address directly onto the package in the AR view. This allows the customer to *visually* confirm the address is correct *before* delivery.
    *   **Dynamic Tracking Link:**  A visually prominent link within the AR experience to the full shipment tracking details.
    *   **"Report Issue" Button:** A button initiating a direct connection to customer support with pre-populated order and AR session data.

**2. Server-Side Integration:**

*   **Image Processing Pipeline:** Enhanced to extract detailed item data from images captured during packing.  This includes not only item identification but also quantity and potential damage flags.
*   **QR Code Generation:** Unique QR code generation tied to each order and packing session. The code contains:
    *   Order ID
    *   Packing Session ID
    *   Secure Access Token
*   **AR Data API:**  API endpoint providing the AR application with the necessary data (item list, quantities, shipping address, damage flags) based on the decoded QR code and associated order/packing session.
*   **Real-time AR Session Logging:** Capture basic metrics about AR session usage (duration, features used, etc.) for analysis and optimization.

**3.  AI-Powered Damage Detection:**

*   **Training Data:** Utilize a dataset of images depicting various types of package and item damage.
*   **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to identify common damage patterns (e.g., dents, tears, crushed corners).
*   **Integration:** The damage detection model runs *on the server side* using images captured during packing. If damage is detected, a visual indicator is displayed within the AR experience *and* a notification is sent to customer support for review.  The AR view could highlight the damaged area(s).

**4.  Workflow:**

1.  Order placed, items picked and packed.
2.  Images of the packed order are captured at the packing station.
3.  The image processing pipeline extracts item data and performs damage detection.
4.  A unique QR code is generated and printed on the shipping label.
5.  The package is shipped.
6.  Customer receives the package.
7.  Customer scans the QR code with the AR application.
8.  The AR application retrieves the order data and displays the AR overlay.
9.  Customer visually verifies the order contents and shipping address.
10. Customer can report issues directly through the AR application.
