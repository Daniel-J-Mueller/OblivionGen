## Adaptive Mesh Network for Dynamic Routing Optimization

**Concept:** Leverage the principles of the provided patent—specifically, offloading routing intelligence and creating logical separation—to build a self-healing, dynamic mesh network *within* the first network.  Instead of a centralized routing service, create a distributed network of 'routing nodes' capable of independently calculating optimal paths *and* dynamically adjusting to network conditions. This is a network *about* a network.

**Specs:**

*   **Node Hardware:** Low-power, ARM-based single-board computers (Raspberry Pi 4 or similar) deployed throughout the first network. Each node must have multiple network interfaces (at least 3 – wired/wireless).  Nodes are not necessarily physically adjacent.

*   **Node Software – Core Routing Engine:** A custom routing daemon, written in Rust or Go, implementing a modified version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm.  Unlike standard implementations, the algorithm will be weighted by *real-time* network performance metrics collected by the nodes (latency, jitter, packet loss, bandwidth).

*   **Node Software – Mesh Topology Management:** A distributed hash table (DHT) based system (Kademlia is a strong candidate) for maintaining the mesh topology. Each node stores information about its neighbors, their performance metrics, and known paths to various destinations.

*   **Routing Data Exchange:**  Nodes will exchange routing information *continuously* with their immediate neighbors.  This isn’t a traditional periodic update; it’s a constant stream of performance data and path advertisements.  Protocol: A custom UDP-based protocol optimized for low overhead.

*   **Path Selection Logic:** Each node maintains a local routing table.  When a packet arrives, the node doesn’t just consult its routing table. It runs a simplified Bellman-Ford calculation *on the fly* using the latest performance data from its neighbors to determine the optimal path.  The routing table serves as a 'seed' for the calculation.

*   **Fault Tolerance:** If a node or link fails, the neighboring nodes will detect the failure quickly (through heartbeat mechanisms) and automatically recalculate their paths.  The mesh topology ensures that there are always multiple paths available.

*   **Integration with Existing Routing Service (Optional):**  Nodes can act as "agents" for the existing routing service. They can collect information about network conditions and provide it to the centralized service, allowing it to make more informed decisions. They also take directional orders from it.

*   **Scalability:** DHT-based topology management and localized path calculations ensure scalability.  The system can handle a large number of nodes without significant performance degradation.

**Pseudocode – Node Path Calculation:**

```
function calculate_path(destination_ip, current_hop_ip):
  neighbors = get_neighbors()
  best_path = null
  min_cost = infinity

  for neighbor in neighbors:
    cost_to_neighbor = get_performance_cost(neighbor)
    if neighbor == destination_ip:
      cost = cost_to_neighbor
    else:
      // Recursive call to calculate path to destination
      path_cost = calculate_path(destination_ip, neighbor.ip)
      if path_cost is not null:
        cost = cost_to_neighbor + path_cost

    if cost < min_cost:
      min_cost = cost
      best_path = neighbor

  if best_path is not null:
    return min_cost
  else:
    return null
```

**Deployment Strategy:**

*   **Initial Seed:** Deploy a small number of nodes in strategic locations to form the initial mesh backbone.

*   **Self-Expansion:** Nodes can automatically discover and connect to each other, expanding the mesh organically.

*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The mesh topology will adapt dynamically to changing network conditions, ensuring optimal performance.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Resilience:**  The mesh topology provides built-in redundancy, making the network more resilient to failures.

*   **Reduced Latency:** Dynamic path selection ensures that packets are routed along the lowest-latency paths.

*   **Increased Bandwidth:**  Packets can be distributed across multiple paths, increasing overall network bandwidth.

*   **Self-Healing:**  The network can automatically recover from failures without manual intervention.
