## Adaptive Packet Prioritization via Predictive Congestion Mapping

**Concept:** Enhance network efficiency and reduce latency by dynamically prioritizing packets based on a predictive congestion map generated from real-time network telemetry. This differs from traditional QoS by *anticipating* congestion, not just reacting to it.

**Specifications:**

**1. Telemetry Collection Agent (Deployed on each host server):**

*   **Data Points:**
    *   Packet inter-arrival times (for both sent and received packets).
    *   Queue lengths at the network interface card (NIC).
    *   CPU utilization.
    *   Memory utilization.
    *   Network interface statistics (bytes sent/received, errors, collisions).
*   **Frequency:**  Sample data at 100Hz.
*   **Transmission:**  Compress and transmit data to the Central Congestion Analyzer (CCA) via UDP.

**2. Central Congestion Analyzer (CCA):**

*   **Algorithm:** Utilize a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on historical network data to predict congestion levels for each network segment (defined by rack, switch, and port).
*   **Input:** Telemetry data from all host servers.
*   **Output:**  A dynamic congestion map, representing the predicted congestion level for each network segment over the next 50ms. Congestion level represented as a numerical value (0-100) or categorized (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
*   **Update Frequency:**  Update congestion map every 25ms.
*   **Storage:** Maintain a rolling history of congestion maps for 60 seconds.

**3. Packet Prioritization Module (Integrated into NIC driver on each host server):**

*   **Input:**  Outgoing packets, congestion map (received from CCA via a multicast stream).
*   **Prioritization Logic:**
    *   Packets destined for segments predicted to experience high congestion receive a higher priority marking (e.g., DSCP EF for voice/video, or a custom DSCP value).
    *   Packets destined for low-congestion segments receive a lower priority marking (e.g., DSCP Default).
    *   Priority marking dynamically adjusted based on real-time congestion map updates.
    *   Implement a "smoothing" algorithm to prevent rapid priority switching for individual flows.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Leverage NIC offload capabilities for packet prioritization and DSCP marking.

**Pseudocode (Packet Prioritization Module):**

```
function prioritizePacket(packet, congestionMap):
  destinationSegment = extractDestinationSegment(packet)
  congestionLevel = getCongestionLevel(congestionMap, destinationSegment)

  if congestionLevel > 75:
    priority = HIGH
    dscp = EF // Example: Expedited Forwarding
  elif congestionLevel > 50:
    priority = MEDIUM
    dscp = AF41 // Example: Assured Forwarding
  else:
    priority = LOW
    dscp = DEFAULT

  setPacketPriority(packet, priority)
  setPacketDSCP(packet, dscp)

  return packet
```

**4. Network Switches:**

*   Configure switches to support DSCP-based QoS.
*   Implement Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) or similar scheduling algorithms to prioritize packets based on their DSCP markings.

**5.  Learning & Adaptation:**

*   Employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to refine the congestion prediction model.
*   The RL agent observes network performance (latency, throughput, packet loss) and adjusts the parameters of the RNN to improve prediction accuracy.
*   A reward function penalizes high latency and packet loss, and rewards high throughput.



**Novelty:**  This design moves beyond reactive QoS to *proactive* congestion management, predicting and mitigating bottlenecks before they impact performance. The combination of RNN-based prediction, RL-based adaptation, and dynamic packet prioritization offers a significantly more robust and efficient solution compared to traditional methods.
