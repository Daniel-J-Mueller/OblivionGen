## Dynamic Network "Shadowing" for Proactive Impairment Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the existing network health monitoring to create a "shadow" network mirroring critical traffic paths. This shadow network actively introduces controlled impairments to predict potential failures *before* they impact production services.

**Specs:**

1.  **Shadow Traffic Replication:**
    *   Utilize existing encapsulation protocol processing components (EPPCs) to replicate a percentage of production traffic destined for critical services (databases, storage). Replication percentage dynamically adjusted based on service criticality & observed network load.
    *   Traffic selection prioritized by: Application Layer Protocol (e.g., prioritize database transactions over web browsing), Source/Destination IP addresses (VIPs), & Packet size (larger packets are more sensitive to loss/corruption).
    *   EPPCs maintain state on replicated flows, ensuring consistent shadow traffic patterns.

2.  **Controlled Impairment Injection:**
    *   A dedicated “Impairment Engine” component, integrated with the NHMS.
    *   Impairment Engine controls latency, packet loss, corruption, and duplication on shadow traffic flows.
    *   Impairment profiles (latency distribution, loss rate) are dynamically adjusted based on historical data, predictive models (e.g., weather patterns, known maintenance windows), and AI-driven anomaly detection.
    *   Injection points strategically placed at key network hops (virtual switches, routers) to simulate realistic failure scenarios.

3.  **Correlation & Prediction:**
    *   NHMS analyzes metrics from both production and shadow networks.
    *   Correlation engine identifies patterns where shadow network impairments *precede* performance degradation in production.
    *   Predictive models trained on correlated data to forecast potential production failures based on shadow network behavior.

4.  **Adaptive Monitoring & Remediation:**
    *   NHMS dynamically adjusts shadow network impairment profiles based on predictive model confidence.
    *   When a high probability of production failure is detected, proactive remediation actions are triggered (e.g., failover to backup resources, traffic rerouting).
    *   Closed-loop feedback system optimizes shadow network configuration to maximize prediction accuracy and minimize false positives.

**Pseudocode (NHMS component):**

```
function analyze_network_health() {
  production_metrics = get_production_metrics();
  shadow_metrics = get_shadow_metrics();

  correlation_score = calculate_correlation(production_metrics, shadow_metrics);

  if (correlation_score > threshold) {
    predicted_impairment = predict_impairment_severity(shadow_metrics);
    trigger_remediation(predicted_impairment);
  }

  adjust_shadow_profile(shadow_metrics);
}

function adjust_shadow_profile(shadow_metrics) {
  // AI model adjusts latency, loss rate, corruption based on historical data
  // & current network conditions
  new_profile = ai_model.predict(shadow_metrics);
  apply_profile(new_profile);
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Existing virtualized infrastructure with EPPCs.
*   Dedicated “Impairment Engine” component (software-based).
*   AI/ML platform for predictive modeling.
*   Increased network bandwidth to support shadow traffic replication.
