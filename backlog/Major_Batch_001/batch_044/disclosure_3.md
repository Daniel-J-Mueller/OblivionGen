## Dynamic Resource Tiering Based on User Engagement

**Concept:** Instead of routing based *solely* on content provider network usage or POP bandwidth, introduce a system that dynamically tiers resource delivery *based on real-time user engagement metrics*. This allows prioritization of content based on *actual* perceived value to the end-user, moving beyond simple cost/bandwidth optimization.

**Specs:**

*   **Engagement Metric Collection:** Client-side JavaScript (or equivalent) collects metrics like:
    *   Time spent on page with resource
    *   Scrolling depth related to resource display
    *   Mouseover/click events directly on resource (images, videos, etc.)
    *   Resource load completion time (initial vs. subsequent)
    *   Video/Audio playback completion percentage
*   **Metric Aggregation & Analysis:** Collected metrics are sent (securely, potentially anonymized) to a central analysis engine. This engine performs:
    *   Real-time aggregation of metrics per resource and per user.
    *   Calculation of an “Engagement Score” – a weighted sum of the collected metrics.  Weights are configurable (e.g., video completion might be weighted higher than a quick image glance).
    *   Tracking of Engagement Score trends over time (short-term vs. long-term).
*   **Dynamic Tiering & Routing:**
    *   Resources are assigned to tiers (e.g., High, Medium, Low) based on their current Engagement Score.
    *   The DNS resolution service (similar to the provided patent's mechanism) is modified to incorporate the tier information.
    *   Instead of *only* selecting a suboptimal POP based on provider usage, the service considers the resource’s tier.
        *   **High Tier:** Prioritize low-latency POPs, even if they are more expensive or congested.  May override provider usage limits.
        *   **Medium Tier:**  Balance latency and cost. Use standard routing.
        *   **Low Tier:**  Route to the most cost-effective (potentially farthest) POP. May be subject to provider throttling.
*   **DNS Resolution Flow:**
    1.  Client requests resource.
    2.  DNS query reaches CDN DNS server.
    3.  CDN server retrieves resource’s current Engagement Score.
    4.  Based on score, CDN selects a routing strategy (prioritized POP, balanced POP, cost-optimized POP).
    5.  CDN returns either:
        *   IP address of a cache component at the selected POP.
        *   An alternative resource identifier (CNAME) directing the client to a different DNS server (POP) for further resolution.

**Pseudocode (DNS Resolution Service):**

```
function resolveResource(dnsQuery):
    resourceId = dnsQuery.getResourceId()
    engagementScore = getEngagementScore(resourceId)

    if engagementScore > HIGH_TIER_THRESHOLD:
        routingStrategy = "prioritized_pop"
    elif engagementScore > MEDIUM_TIER_THRESHOLD:
        routingStrategy = "balanced_pop"
    else:
        routingStrategy = "cost_optimized_pop"

    switch routingStrategy:
        case "prioritized_pop":
            pop = selectFastestPop()
            return pop.getCacheIP()
        case "balanced_pop":
            pop = selectBalancedPop()
            return pop.getCacheIP()
        case "cost_optimized_pop":
            pop = selectCheapestPop()
            return pop.getCacheIP()
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:**  Anonymization and aggregation of engagement metrics are critical. Users should have control over data collection.
*   **Spoofing:**  Mechanism to prevent malicious actors from artificially inflating engagement scores.
*   **Real-time Adaptability:**  System must adapt quickly to changes in engagement patterns.
*   **Integration with Existing CDN Infrastructure:** Minimal disruption to existing workflows.
