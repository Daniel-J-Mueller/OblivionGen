## Adaptive Data Partitioning with Dynamic Calculation Unit Assignment

**Concept:** Extend the parallel calculation framework to not just distribute parity/reconstruction *calculations*, but also the *data itself* across calculation units, dynamically adjusting data partitioning based on workload and unit availability. This moves beyond simply parallelizing the math to parallelizing data access and preprocessing, potentially unlocking significant performance gains, especially for large datasets.

**Specs:**

*   **System Components:**
    *   Calculator: R calculation units, each with local buffer.
    *   Global Data Buffer: A larger, shared memory space.
    *   Partitioning & Assignment Controller: Software/hardware responsible for data partitioning, assigning partitions to calculation units, and managing data transfers.
    *   Workload Monitor: Tracks the processing load on each calculation unit.
*   **Data Partitioning Strategy:**
    *   Data is divided into 'chunks'. Chunk size is *not* fixed, and is determined dynamically.
    *   Partitioning can be based on several factors:
        *   **Data Locality:** Chunks containing related data are grouped together.
        *   **Workload Balancing:** Chunks are assigned to calculation units with the lowest current load.
        *   **Data Dependency:** Chunks required for immediate calculation are prioritized for assignment.
*   **Dynamic Assignment:**
    *   The Partitioning & Assignment Controller monitors the workload on each calculation unit.
    *   When a calculation unit becomes available, the controller assigns it a data chunk.
    *   Data is transferred from the Global Data Buffer to the calculation unit's local buffer.
    *   The calculation unit processes the assigned data chunk, calculating parity/reconstruction vectors as needed.
    *   Results are written back to the Global Data Buffer.
*   **Pseudocode (Partitioning & Assignment Controller):**

```
//Initialization
Initialize Global Data Buffer
Initialize R Calculation Units
Define Chunk Size Parameters (Min, Max)

//Main Loop
While (Data Available) {
    Chunk = Determine Next Data Chunk
    Calculate Ideal Chunk Size based on current workload and Chunk Size Parameters
    Unit = Select Calculation Unit with Lowest Workload
    If (Unit.Buffer.Capacity < Chunk.Size) {
        //Adjust Chunk Size or wait for unit to become available
        Reduce Chunk Size until it fits, or pause assignment.
    }
    Transfer Data from Global Buffer to Unit.Buffer
    Assign Chunk to Unit for processing
    Update Unit.Workload Status
}
```

*   **RAID Level Adaptation:**
    *   The system can dynamically adapt to different RAID levels by adjusting the number of parity chunks and the data partitioning strategy.
    *   For example, RAID 5 requires one parity chunk per stripe, while RAID 6 requires two. The partitioning controller can handle these differences seamlessly.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Each calculation unit performs checksums on data it receives.
    *   If an error is detected, the unit requests a re-transmission from the Global Data Buffer.
    *   The system can tolerate failures of individual calculation units by re-assigning their work to other units.
*   **Buffering Strategy:** Implement tiered buffering within each Calculation Unit. A small, fast SRAM cache for frequently accessed data, and a larger DRAM buffer for less frequently accessed data. The controller manages data movement between these tiers.

**Novelty:** This moves beyond parallelizing the calculation of parity/reconstruction vectors. It's about parallelizing *everything* – data access, preprocessing, and calculation. It’s an active, adaptive system, not a static one. The dynamic data partitioning and assignment are the key differentiators.
