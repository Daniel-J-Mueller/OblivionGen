## Adaptive Zone Masking with Environmental Context

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing doorbell camera & motion sensors + ambient light sensor + microphone. Addition of a small, low-power radar module (e.g., millimeter wave) for coarse environmental mapping (1-2m range).
*   **Software:** Core logic embedded in doorbell processor.  Cloud connectivity for optional model updates and long-term data analysis.

**Functionality:**

The system dynamically adjusts motion detection zones *based on detected environmental conditions*.  It goes beyond static user-defined zones and actively learns to ignore recurring “false positive” sources, while enhancing sensitivity to genuine threats.

**Operational Logic:**

1.  **Environmental Sensing:** Continuously monitor:
    *   Ambient Light Level (determines visibility & expected motion patterns)
    *   Audio Profile (identifies common sounds like birds, rustling leaves, traffic)
    *   Radar Mapping (detects static objects – trees, bushes, parked cars – and their approximate size/distance)
2.  **Zone Masking & Sensitivity Adjustment:**
    *   **Static Object Exclusion:** Radar data is used to automatically *mask* motion detection zones corresponding to known static objects.  This eliminates alerts triggered by swaying branches or moving shadows *caused by* those objects.
    *   **Audio-Triggered Sensitivity:** Based on the audio profile, sensitivity is adjusted for specific zones.
        *   High traffic noise: Decrease sensitivity in street-facing zones.
        *   Birdsong:  Ignore motion in tree-adjacent zones unless accompanied by unusual sounds.
    *   **Light-Level Adaptation:**  Sensitivity is increased in zones during low-light conditions (enhancing night vision), and decreased during bright daylight (reducing oversensitivity).
    *   **Dynamic Learning:**  The system logs instances of ignored motion events (after initial radar/audio/light analysis). Over time, it refines its exclusion rules and sensitivity adjustments based on user-confirmed “false positive” classifications.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
// Define motion zones (user-defined base)
zone[1..N]

// Sensing Data (updated continuously)
lightLevel = getAmbientLight()
audioProfile = getAudioProfile()
radarMap = getRadarMap()

// For each motion zone:
for i = 1 to N:
    // Check for static objects within zone
    if radarMap.containsStaticObject(zone[i]):
        zone[i].sensitivity = 0  // Disable motion detection
    else:
        zone[i].sensitivity = baseSensitivity

        // Adjust based on environment
        if lightLevel < thresholdLow:
            zone[i].sensitivity *= nightMultiplier
        if audioProfile.contains(trafficNoise):
            zone[i].sensitivity *= trafficMultiplier
        // Add other environmental triggers as needed

        // Log motion events & update sensitivity based on user feedback
        if motionDetected(zone[i]):
            logMotionEvent(zone[i], lightLevel, audioProfile, radarMap)
            if userConfirmsFalsePositive():
                adjustSensitivity(zone[i], -sensitivityAdjustmentRate)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significantly reduced false alarms.
*   Improved accuracy of motion detection.
*   Adaptive system that learns and improves over time.
*   Enhanced user experience.
*   Potentially, integration with smart home systems for automated responses based on detected activity.
