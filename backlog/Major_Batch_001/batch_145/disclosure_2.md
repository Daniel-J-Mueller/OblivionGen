## Adaptive Directory Prefetching based on Move Rank Prediction

**System Specifications:**

*   **Component:** File System Metadata Manager Enhancement
*   **Purpose:** Proactively prefetch directory contents anticipated to be moved, reducing latency during move operations.

**Detailed Description:**

The core concept is to leverage the “Move Rank” (MR) system outlined in the source patent, but repurpose it for *prediction*. Instead of solely using MR to facilitate move operations, we utilize historical data to predict future move candidates *before* a request is issued. This system isn't about making moves *easier*, it's about making them *faster* by anticipating them.

1.  **Historical Move Analysis:**
    *   A background process continuously monitors directory move requests.
    *   For each move, it records:
        *   Source Directory (SD)
        *   Proposed Parent Directory (PPD)
        *   Timestamp
        *   Move Duration (time taken to complete the move)
    *   This data is stored in a dedicated “Move History Database” (MHD).

2.  **Move Rank Prediction Model:**
    *   A machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or a Markov model) is trained on the MHD.
    *   Input Features:
        *   Directory MR (as defined in the source patent)
        *   Parent Directory MR
        *   Directory Size
        *   File Creation/Modification Frequency within the directory
        *   Time Since Last Move (of either SD or PPD)
    *   Output: “Move Probability Score” (MPS) for each directory. This score represents the likelihood of a directory being moved within a specified time window (e.g., next hour, next day).

3.  **Prefetching Mechanism:**
    *   A “Prefetch Manager” continuously scans the file system tree.
    *   For each directory, it retrieves the MPS from the Move Rank Prediction Model.
    *   If MPS exceeds a configurable threshold:
        *   The Prefetch Manager initiates a background prefetch operation for the directory’s contents (files and subdirectories).
        *   Prefetched data is stored in a dedicated “Prefetch Cache” (potentially utilizing a high-speed storage tier like NVMe SSD).
        *   The system tracks which directories have been prefetched.

4.  **Move Request Handling:**
    *   When a directory move request is received:
        *   The system checks if the SD has been prefetched.
        *   If prefetched:
            *   The move operation utilizes the prefetched data from the Prefetch Cache, significantly reducing the data transfer overhead.
            *   The Prefetch Cache entry is invalidated after the move is completed.
        *   If not prefetched:
            *   The move operation proceeds as normal, utilizing the standard file system mechanisms.

**Pseudocode (Prefetch Manager):**

```
function prefetch_scan() {
  for each directory in file_system_tree {
    mps = get_move_probability_score(directory)
    if mps > PREFETCH_THRESHOLD {
      if not is_directory_prefetched(directory) {
        prefetch_directory_contents(directory)
        mark_directory_as_prefetched(directory)
      }
    }
  }
}

function prefetch_directory_contents(directory) {
  // Read all files and subdirectories within the directory
  // Store the data in the Prefetch Cache
}

function get_move_probability_score(directory) {
  // Query the Move Rank Prediction Model with directory features
  // Return the predicted Move Probability Score
}

function mark_directory_as_prefetched(directory) {
  // Update a bitmap or cache to indicate the directory has been prefetched
}
```

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   The Move Rank Prediction Model should be trained and updated incrementally to handle file system changes without requiring a full retraining.
*   The Prefetch Cache should be distributed across multiple storage nodes to handle large file systems and high prefetch rates.
*   The Prefetch Manager should be multi-threaded to efficiently scan the file system tree.
