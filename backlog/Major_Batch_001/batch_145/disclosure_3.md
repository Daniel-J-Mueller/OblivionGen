## Adaptive Schema Evolution via Deterministic Value Generator ‘Seeds’

**Specification:** A system for facilitating rapid and safe schema evolution in a multi-data-store environment, leveraging deterministic value generators as ‘seeds’ for new data structures and attribute definitions.

**Problem:** Traditional schema evolution often requires downtime, complex migration scripts, and risks data loss or inconsistency.  Introducing new attributes or data types necessitates updating all existing data, a costly and error-prone process.

**Innovation:** Introduce a ‘Schema Seed’ system.  Rather than immediately altering the live schema, new attributes/data types are introduced as ‘virtual’ attributes, generated on-demand using deterministic value generators.  

**Components:**

*   **Schema Seed Generator (SSG):** A service responsible for creating and managing deterministic value generators based on proposed schema changes.  The SSG takes as input a schema modification request (e.g., “add attribute ‘loyalty_score’ to ‘customer’ entity”) and generates a corresponding deterministic value generator. This generator doesn't *store* the score; it calculates it on the fly based on existing data.
*   **Virtual Attribute Resolver (VAR):** A component within each data store manager responsible for intercepting read requests for virtual attributes.  If a read request targets a virtual attribute, the VAR invokes the corresponding deterministic value generator to calculate the value on-demand.
*   **Gradual Materialization Engine (GME):** A background process that gradually materializes virtual attributes into physical columns.  The GME prioritizes frequently accessed data and utilizes a configurable ‘materialization threshold’ (e.g., materialize the attribute if it's read more than 100 times in a 24-hour period).
*   **Rollback Mechanism:**  If a schema change proves problematic, the GME can be halted, and the deterministic value generators can be deactivated, effectively reverting to the original schema.

**Workflow:**

1.  A developer proposes a schema change (e.g., adding a ‘risk_score’ to the ‘account’ entity).
2.  The SSG generates a deterministic value generator for ‘risk_score’. This generator might calculate the score based on factors like transaction history, account age, and geographic location.
3.  The VAR intercepts read requests for ‘account.risk_score’. Instead of accessing a physical column, it invokes the generator to calculate the score.
4.  The GME monitors access patterns to ‘account.risk_score’. If the access frequency exceeds the materialization threshold, it begins to populate a new ‘risk_score’ column in the ‘account’ table.
5.  Once the materialization is complete, the VAR switches from using the generator to reading from the physical column.  The generator can then be decommissioned.

**Pseudocode (VAR component):**

```
function resolveAttribute(entity, attributeName):
  if attributeIsVirtual(entity, attributeName):
    generator = getDeterministicValueGenerator(entity, attributeName)
    if generator != null:
      return generator.generateValue(entity)
    else:
      // Error: Generator not found
      return null
  else:
    // Attribute is physical – read directly from data store
    return readAttributeFromDataStore(entity, attributeName)
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Zero-Downtime Schema Evolution:**  New attributes are available immediately without requiring downtime.
*   **Reduced Risk:**  Changes can be tested and validated in production without impacting existing data.
*   **Improved Performance:**  Materialization ensures that frequently accessed attributes are stored physically, improving read performance.
*   **Simplified Rollback:**  Changes can be reverted easily by stopping the materialization process and deactivating the generators.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Automated Generator Creation:**  Automatically generate deterministic value generators based on schema modification requests.
*   **Cost-Based Materialization:**  Prioritize materialization based on the cost of generating the attribute versus the cost of reading it from disk.
*   **A/B Testing of Schema Changes:**  Use the system to A/B test different schema changes in production.
