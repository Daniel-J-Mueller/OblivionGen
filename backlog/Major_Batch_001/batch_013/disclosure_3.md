## Adaptive Interior Cushioning & Scent Diffusion

**System Specs:**

*   **Components:**
    *   High-resolution internal scanning system (LiDAR or structured light) integrated into fulfillment center conveyor system.
    *   Automated material deposition system capable of creating variable-density cushioning from bio-degradable foam or mycelium-based composites.
    *   Micro-encapsulation system for scent and/or antimicrobial agents embedded within cushioning material.
    *   Centralized order/product database containing dimensional data and customer preference profiles.
    *   Robotic arm/end effector for precise material deposition and scent capsule placement.

*   **Functional Description:**
    1.  Upon item placement within the shipment container, the internal scanner maps the item's geometry and fragile points.
    2.  Based on scan data and product database information, the system generates a customized cushioning profile.  High-density cushioning protects fragile areas; low-density cushioning fills void spaces.
    3.  The material deposition system builds the cushioning *in situ* within the container, conforming precisely to the item's shape.
    4.  Scent capsules (selected based on customer preference or product type - e.g., lavender for sleep-related products, citrus for cleaning supplies) are strategically placed within the cushioning matrix during deposition.
    5.  A final scan verifies cushioning coverage and capsule placement.
    6.  Container is sealed and prepared for shipment.

*   **Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION CreateCustomCushion(itemData, customerPrefs, containerID)
  // itemData: Dimensions, fragility map, product type
  // customerPrefs: Scent preference, sensitivity to scents
  // containerID: Unique identifier for the shipment container

  SCAN container, item USING LiDAR
  GENERATE fragilityMap FROM scanData, itemData
  SELECT cushioningDensity BASED ON fragilityMap
  SELECT scentCapsule BASED ON customerPrefs
  
  LOOP for each (x, y, z) coordinate within container bounds
    IF distance(coordinate, itemSurface) < cushioningThreshold
      DEPOSIT cushioningMaterial AT coordinate WITH density = cushioningDensity(coordinate)
      IF coordinate within scentPlacementZone
        INSERT scentCapsule AT coordinate
    ENDIF
  ENDLOOP

  VERIFY cushioningCoverage, scentCapsulePlacement
  
  RETURN container WITH custom cushioning, scent
ENDFUNCTION
```

*   **Material Specifications:**
    *   Cushioning Material: Mycelium composite (grown in custom molds for density control), biodegradable foam derived from agricultural waste.
    *   Scent Capsules:  Micro-encapsulated essential oils or fragrance compounds, biodegradable casing.
    *   Container Compatibility: System adaptable to various container sizes and materials.
