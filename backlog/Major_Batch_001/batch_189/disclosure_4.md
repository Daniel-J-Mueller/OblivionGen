## Dynamic Oscillation Masking for Enhanced Entropy

**Concept:** Expand upon the ring oscillator configuration by introducing a dynamically adjustable masking system *within* each oscillator, allowing for nuanced control beyond simple on/off switching. This creates a far richer landscape of possible oscillator states, significantly boosting entropy.

**Specs:**

*   **Oscillator Core:** Standard ring oscillator design (CMOS gates, adjustable delay elements).
*   **Masking Network:**  Each ring oscillator will have an associated digitally-controlled masking network placed *within* the feedback path. This network consists of a series of transmission gates controlled by a small register (4-8 bits per oscillator).
*   **Masking Functionality:** The transmission gates selectively bypass or include sections of the ring oscillator's delay chain.  This doesn’t *stop* oscillation, but alters its frequency in granular steps.  A full masking register value will essentially 'shorten' the oscillator, yielding a higher frequency; a zero value extends the delay, lowering frequency.
*   **PRNG Integration:** The PRNG doesn’t just configure 'on/off' bits. Instead, the PRNG generates a multi-bit configuration value *per oscillator*, directly controlling the masking network register. This allows for a much wider range of frequency configurations.
*   **Entropy Accumulation Phase:** All oscillators receive a common "seed" masking configuration from the PRNG, establishing a baseline. This aids in initial entropy accumulation.
*   **Phase Lock Break Phase:** The PRNG begins generating *unique* masking configurations for each oscillator. The granularity of the masking network controls the level of decorrelation between the oscillators.
*   **Output XOR Tree:**  Outputs of all oscillators feed into an XOR tree, as in the base patent, generating a random bit.
*   **Feedback Loop:** The random bit is XORed with the current PRNG state, advancing the PRNG.

**Pseudocode (Configuration Update):**

```
// For each ring oscillator 'i' in 'num_oscillators'
oscillator_config[i] = PRNG_generate_config()  // Generate a multi-bit config (e.g., 8 bits)
masking_network_set_config(oscillator_config[i], oscillator_i) //Apply config to masking network
frequency[i] = calculate_frequency(oscillator_config[i]) //Calculate effective frequency based on config
random_bit = XOR_tree(frequency[0], frequency[1], ..., frequency[num_oscillators-1])
PRNG_state = XOR(PRNG_state, random_bit)
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Masking Granularity:** Experiment with different numbers of transmission gates and the size of the masking registers to optimize for entropy and frequency control.
*   **Non-Linear Masking:** Explore incorporating non-linear elements within the masking network to introduce further complexity and potentially increase entropy.
*   **Adaptive Masking:** Implement a control loop that monitors the output of the XOR tree and adjusts the masking configurations to maximize entropy.
*    **Differential Masking:** Instead of absolute masking configurations, use *differential* changes to the masking values, providing a smoother transition between states and potentially reducing phase locking.
