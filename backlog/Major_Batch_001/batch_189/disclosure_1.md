## Multi-Sensor Fusion for Predictive Motion Analysis & Scene Context

**Concept:** Expanding on the idea of dual motion sensors, this system utilizes a network of diverse sensors beyond PIR, coupled with rudimentary scene understanding to *predict* motion before it’s fully registered, and contextualize alerts based on probable intent.

**Sensor Suite:**

*   **PIR Sensors (x2):** As in the base patent, for initial motion detection.
*   **Microphone Array (x4):**  To capture and analyze audio cues – footsteps, voices, breaking glass – providing early indicators *and* potential intent.
*   **Low-Resolution Thermal Camera:** Identifies heat signatures, enabling detection through obstructions (smoke, darkness) and providing basic object classification (human, animal, vehicle).
*   **Vibration Sensor:** Attached to a mounting surface (wall, window frame) – detects attempts to force entry or unusual structural movement *before* PIR is triggered.

**Processing Pipeline:**

1.  **Raw Data Acquisition:** Each sensor stream feeds into a dedicated pre-processing module.
2.  **Feature Extraction:**
    *   **PIR:** Max/Min signal times, duration of detection.
    *   **Microphone:** Frequency analysis (identifying key sounds), sound source localization, speech/non-speech detection.
    *   **Thermal:** Heat signature size, movement speed, object classification probabilities.
    *   **Vibration:** Amplitude, frequency, duration of vibration events.
3.  **Sensor Fusion (Kalman Filter/Bayesian Network):** Combines features from all sensors to create a probabilistic model of movement.  This model predicts the *likelihood* of motion occurring in a specific area *before* it's definitively detected by PIR.
4.  **Contextual Analysis (Rule-Based System/Simple Neural Net):**  Analyzes the predicted motion against pre-defined rules and/or learned patterns to determine probable intent.
    *   **Example Rules:**
        *   "If vibration sensor detects impact *and* microphone detects glass breaking, assume forced entry."
        *   "If thermal camera detects a heat signature approaching the front door *and* microphone detects a voice, assume someone is approaching the door."
    *   **Learned Patterns:** The system can learn to associate specific sensor combinations with specific events (e.g., a cat jumping onto a counter).
5.  **Alert Generation:** Generates alerts based on the probability of motion *and* the inferred intent.  Alerts can be prioritized and customized based on the context.

**Pseudocode (Alert Generation):**

```
// Define confidence thresholds
CONFIDENCE_HIGH = 0.9
CONFIDENCE_MEDIUM = 0.6
CONFIDENCE_LOW = 0.3

// Define intent levels
INTENT_EMERGENCY = "Forced Entry"
INTENT_WARNING = "Possible Intruder"
INTENT_NORMAL = "Motion Detected"

// Calculate overall confidence score (weighted average of sensor data)
confidence = (weight_pir * pir_confidence) + (weight_mic * mic_confidence) + (weight_thermal * thermal_confidence) + (weight_vibration * vibration_confidence)

// Infer intent based on sensor data and context
if (intent == INTENT_EMERGENCY) {
    alert_level = "High"
} else if (intent == INTENT_WARNING) {
    alert_level = "Medium"
} else {
    alert_level = "Low"
}

// Generate alert (if confidence exceeds threshold)
if (confidence > CONFIDENCE_HIGH) {
    generate_alert(alert_level, "Potential emergency situation detected.")
} else if (confidence > CONFIDENCE_MEDIUM) {
    generate_alert(alert_level, "Motion detected. Monitoring for changes.")
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Multi-core processor for parallel processing of sensor data.
*   Dedicated sensor interfaces (USB, I2C, SPI).
*   Sufficient memory for storing sensor data and learned patterns.
*   Wireless communication module (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) for remote access and control.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Integration with smart home automation systems.
*   Facial recognition for identifying individuals.
*   Object tracking for monitoring movement within a scene.
*   Machine learning for continuously improving the accuracy and reliability of the system.
