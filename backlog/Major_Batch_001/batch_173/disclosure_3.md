## Adaptive Fault Domain Sharding

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of fault domain assignments for data items based on observed access patterns and failure rates. The goal is to optimize both durability and performance by proactively adapting to workload characteristics and infrastructure health.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Item Metadata Enhancement:**

*   Each data item will be augmented with metadata tracking:
    *   `AccessFrequency`: Number of reads/writes within a rolling time window.
    *   `FaultDomainHistory`: List of fault domains (data centers, availability zones) where the data item has been successfully accessed/updated.
    *   `ShardLevel`: Integer indicating the current granularity of fault domain assignment (1 = coarse, higher = finer).
    *   `ReplicationFactor`:  The total number of replicas for the item.

**2. Monitoring & Analysis Service:**

*   A dedicated service continuously monitors access patterns and failure rates for all data items.
*   It calculates a “Volatility Score” for each item based on:
    *   `AccessFrequency`: High frequency = lower Volatility Score
    *   `FaultDomainHistory`: Fewer unique fault domains = lower Volatility Score
    *   Recent failure events impacting access to the data item.

**3. Adaptive Sharding Algorithm:**

*   The algorithm runs periodically (e.g., every hour) and assesses each data item’s current `ShardLevel`.
*   **Increasing Granularity (Fine-Grained):** If the Volatility Score is high (indicating frequent changes and/or access from diverse locations):
    *   Increase `ShardLevel` by 1.
    *   Re-shard the data item, distributing replicas across a larger number of fault domains.
    *   Adjust `ReplicationFactor` to maintain durability requirements.
*   **Decreasing Granularity (Coarse-Grained):** If the Volatility Score is low (indicating stable access and/or access from a limited number of locations):
    *   Decrease `ShardLevel` by 1.
    *   Consolidate replicas into fewer fault domains.
    *   Reduce `ReplicationFactor` (within durability limits) to save resources.

**4.  Dynamic Replica Placement:**

*   When re-sharding, the system employs a cost model to determine optimal replica placement.  Factors considered:
    *   Network latency between clients and potential replica locations.
    *   Current load on each node.
    *   Correlation between fault domains (e.g., nodes in the same rack).

**5.  Pseudocode (Shard Level Adjustment):**

```pseudocode
function adjustShardLevel(dataItem):
  volatilityScore = calculateVolatilityScore(dataItem)
  currentShardLevel = dataItem.ShardLevel

  if volatilityScore > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
    newShardLevel = min(MAX_SHARD_LEVEL, currentShardLevel + 1)
    reshardData(dataItem, newShardLevel)
  elif volatilityScore < LOW_THRESHOLD:
    newShardLevel = max(MIN_SHARD_LEVEL, currentShardLevel - 1)
    reshardData(dataItem, newShardLevel)
  else:
    # No change
    pass

function calculateVolatilityScore(dataItem):
  # Implement logic using AccessFrequency, FaultDomainHistory, and failure events
  # Higher score indicates higher volatility
  return score

function reshardData(dataItem, newShardLevel):
  # Implement logic to re-distribute replicas across fault domains
  # based on the new shard level
  pass
```

**6.  Scalability & Fault Tolerance:**

*   The Monitoring & Analysis Service should be horizontally scalable.
*   Resharding operations should be performed incrementally to minimize disruption.
*   Metadata should be replicated for high availability.
