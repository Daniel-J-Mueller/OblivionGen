## Dynamic Path Prediction & Proactive Recommendation System

**System Overview:** This system extends location-based recommendations by incorporating predictive modeling of user paths *before* the user physically arrives at a location, combined with a dynamic "influence radius" based on real-time contextual factors. It moves beyond reacting to current location to anticipating needs based on likely trajectories.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Trajectory Prediction Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Historical location data, time of day, day of week, seasonality, user-defined preferences (e.g., preferred routes, frequently visited types of locations). External data feeds: Traffic conditions, event schedules (concerts, sporting events), weather forecasts.
    *   **Process:** Employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained to predict probable user paths. Outputs a probability distribution over possible routes, generating multiple plausible trajectories with associated confidence scores.
    *   **Output:** Ranked list of predicted paths, each with a probability score and estimated time of arrival (ETA) for key locations along the route.

2.  **Dynamic Influence Radius (DIR) Calculator:**
    *   **Input:** Predicted path probabilities, real-time contextual data (see Trajectory Prediction Engine), local venue/POI density, user’s historical engagement with nearby POIs.
    *   **Process:**  Calculates a dynamic radius around the user's predicted path.  This radius isn't fixed; it expands/contracts based on the density of interesting POIs (restaurants, shops, attractions) and the user’s predicted dwell time in that area.  Higher density/longer dwell time = larger radius.
    *   **Output:** A polygon or series of polygons defining the DIR along the predicted path.

3.  **Proactive Recommendation Engine:**
    *   **Input:** DIR, user profile, POI database, real-time offers/promotions.
    *   **Process:** Identifies POIs falling within the DIR. Applies a weighted scoring algorithm based on:
        *   User preference matching.
        *   POI relevance to predicted activity (e.g., coffee shop near a morning commute route).
        *   Real-time offers (discounts, special events).
        *   POI popularity (based on user reviews, social media activity).
    *   **Output:** Ranked list of proactive recommendations delivered to the user's device *before* they arrive at the location.

**Data Flow:**

1.  User's location data is continuously collected and transmitted to the system.
2.  The Trajectory Prediction Engine generates probable paths with associated confidence scores.
3.  The Dynamic Influence Radius Calculator determines the DIR along the predicted paths.
4.  The Proactive Recommendation Engine identifies and ranks relevant POIs within the DIR.
5.  Recommendations are delivered to the user's device via a mobile app or other interface.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Recommendation Engine):**

```pseudocode
function generateRecommendations(userProfile, dir, poiDatabase):
    recommendations = []
    for poi in poiDatabase:
        if poi is within dir:
            score = calculateScore(userProfile, poi)
            recommendations.append((poi, score))

    recommendations.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return recommendations[:5] // Return top 5 recommendations

function calculateScore(userProfile, poi):
    preferenceMatchScore = calculatePreferenceMatch(userProfile, poi)
    relevanceScore = calculateRelevance(poi)
    offerScore = calculateOfferValue(poi)
    popularityScore = calculatePopularity(poi)

    totalScore = (0.4 * preferenceMatchScore) + (0.2 * relevanceScore) + (0.2 * offerScore) + (0.2 * popularityScore)
    return totalScore
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Cloud-based infrastructure (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for data storage and processing.
*   Mobile app (iOS/Android) for user interface and location data collection.
*   Machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for trajectory prediction.
*   Real-time data streams for traffic, weather, and event information.
*   Database for storing user profiles, POI data, and historical location information.
