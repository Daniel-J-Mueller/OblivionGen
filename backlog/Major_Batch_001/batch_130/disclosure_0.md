## Adaptive Honeypot Persona Generation

**Specification:** A system to dynamically generate and deploy honeypot 'personas' – complete digital identities – based on observed threat actor Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). This moves beyond simulating *resources* to simulating *users* and their behavior.

**Core Components:**

1.  **TTP Ingestion & Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Real-time threat intelligence feeds (e.g., MISP, AbuseIPDB), security logs (SIEM), and dark web monitoring data.
    *   Function: Extracts TTPs – commonly used tools, exploited vulnerabilities, command-and-control patterns, and targeting preferences.  Utilizes NLP and machine learning to categorize and prioritize TTPs based on prevalence and severity.
    *   Output:  A dynamic ‘TTP Profile’ detailing the current threat landscape.

2.  **Persona Generation Engine:**
    *   Input: TTP Profile, Persona Template Library.
    *   Persona Template Library: Contains base profiles – “developer”, “sysadmin”, “accountant”, “marketing manager”, etc. – defined by typical software installed, browsing history, social media presence, and communication patterns.
    *   Function:  Selects a base persona and modifies it based on the TTP Profile.  This includes:
        *   Software installation: Installing vulnerable versions of software actively exploited in current attacks.
        *   Data creation: Populating the persona’s “desktop” and “documents” with realistic-looking (but harmless) files related to the targeted industry and vulnerabilities.
        *   Browser configuration: Setting up realistic browser extensions and plugins, with pre-defined bookmarks and history mirroring threat actor preferences.
        *   Communication profile: Configuring email and messaging accounts with realistic signatures and contact lists.
        *   Habit simulation: Creating a schedule of login times, application usage, and data access patterns.
    *   Output:  A complete, simulated digital identity.

3.  **Deployment & Monitoring System:**
    *   Input: Generated Persona.
    *   Function: Deploys the persona as a virtual machine or container, integrating it into the network as a seemingly legitimate user.
    *   Monitors all activity within the persona for malicious behavior.  Emphasis on detecting lateral movement, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration attempts.  Because the persona *expects* attack, the system can perform deeper analysis of attacker methods.
    *   Allows for remote control and interaction with the persona to lure attackers and gather intelligence.
    *   Provides a feedback loop to the TTP Ingestion & Analysis Module, refining the TTP profiles and persona generation process.

**Pseudocode (Persona Generation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION GeneratePersona(TTPProfile, PersonaTemplate):
  persona = Clone(PersonaTemplate)
  
  // Software Installation
  FOR vulnerability IN TTPProfile.ExploitedVulnerabilities:
    InstallSoftware(persona, vulnerability.Software, vulnerability.Version)
    
  // Data Creation
  FOR fileType IN TTPProfile.TargetedFileTypes:
    CreateRealisticFile(persona, fileType, TTPProfile.Industry)
    
  // Browser Configuration
  FOR extension IN TTPProfile.MaliciousExtensions:
    InstallBrowserExtension(persona, extension)
    
  // Communication Profile
  SetEmailSignature(persona, GenerateRealisticSignature())
  PopulateContacts(persona, GenerateRealisticContacts())
  
  // Habit Simulation
  CreateSchedule(persona, GenerateRealisticSchedule())
  
  RETURN persona
```

**Novelty:**

The core innovation isn't simulating *what* is being attacked (servers, databases), but simulating *who* is being attacked – a realistic user with a predictable, yet vulnerable, profile. This shifts the focus from detection to deception, creating a more engaging and informative honeypot experience for attackers. This also allows for more nuanced threat intelligence gathering, as the honeypot can provide insights into attacker motivations and targeting preferences.
