## Dynamic Haptic Guidance System for Fulfillment

**Concept:** Integrate localized, dynamic haptic feedback into wearable devices to subtly guide workers to items, minimizing visual reliance on the AR interface and maximizing efficiency, especially in cluttered environments.

**Specifications:**

**1. Haptic Grid Module:**

*   **Type:** Flexible, low-profile grid of micro-actuators.
*   **Placement:** Integrated into the back of the hand or forearm wearable (existing or new form factor).  Dimensions: 15cm x 10cm.
*   **Actuator Density:**  30 actuators per 10cm².
*   **Actuation Type:** Electroactive polymers (EAPs) for rapid and precise localized pressure changes. 
*   **Power:** Low-voltage DC (3.3V-5V) via wearable’s power supply.

**2.  Real-Time Localization System (RTLS) Integration:**

*   **Input:** RTLS data stream (Ultra-Wideband, Bluetooth Low Energy, or similar) providing worker’s precise position within the fulfillment center.
*   **Data Fusion:** Software module combining RTLS data with item location data (from existing WMS).
*   **Prediction Algorithm:** Kalman Filter or similar to predict worker’s trajectory and anticipate required guidance.

**3.  Guidance Algorithm:**

*   **Vector Field Generation:** Based on predicted trajectory and item location, generate a ‘haptic vector field’ – a series of localized pressure gradients on the haptic grid.
*   **Intensity Mapping:** Pressure intensity proportional to proximity to item and desired course correction. Higher intensity indicates stronger directional guidance.
*   **Adaptive Sensitivity:** Adjust pressure sensitivity based on worker speed and surrounding clutter. Slower speeds/more clutter = finer-grained guidance.
*   **Obstacle Avoidance:** Integrate data from environmental sensors (e.g., depth cameras) to adjust haptic guidance in real-time to avoid obstacles.

**4.  AR Interface Integration:**

*   **Hybrid Guidance:**  Allow worker to switch between purely haptic guidance, purely visual guidance (AR), or a combination of both.
*   **Haptic Confirmation:** Use haptic ‘pulses’ to confirm successful item acquisition.
*   **AR Overlay:** Visual representation of haptic guidance vectors overlaid on the AR display (optional).

**Pseudocode (Guidance Algorithm):**

```
// Inputs: worker_position, item_position, worker_velocity, obstacle_data
// Outputs: haptic_grid_state (array of pressure values for each actuator)

function generate_haptic_guidance(worker_position, item_position, worker_velocity, obstacle_data) {

  // Calculate vector from worker to item
  direction_vector = item_position - worker_position

  // Normalize direction vector
  normalized_direction = normalize(direction_vector)

  // Calculate desired course correction angle
  course_correction_angle = angle_between(worker_velocity, normalized_direction)

  // Adjust course correction angle based on obstacle data
  adjusted_angle = avoid_obstacles(course_correction_angle, obstacle_data)

  // Calculate pressure intensity based on distance to item
  distance = calculate_distance(worker_position, item_position)
  intensity = 1.0 - (distance / max_distance) //Scale intensity

  // Map angle and intensity to haptic grid actuators
  haptic_grid_state = map_to_grid(adjusted_angle, intensity)

  return haptic_grid_state
}
```
