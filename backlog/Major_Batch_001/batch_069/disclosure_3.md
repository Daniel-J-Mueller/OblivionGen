**Immutable Instance 'Shadowing' for Predictive Failure Mitigation**

**Concept:** Extend the immutable configuration concept to create a 'shadow' instance alongside a primary virtual machine. This shadow instance mirrors the configuration *at a specific point in time* – a known good state. Discrepancies between the primary instance and the shadow, detected through continuous monitoring, indicate potential configuration drift or compromises.

**Specifications:**

*   **Shadow Instance Creation:** Upon instantiation of a primary VM with immutable configuration flags enabled, a shadow VM is automatically provisioned. This shadow is a lightweight copy – potentially using snapshots or differential storage – focusing on configuration data (network, storage, key OS settings) rather than full data replication.
*   **Configuration Monitoring:** A dedicated monitoring agent operates on both primary and shadow instances. This agent continuously compares critical configuration parameters (defined via a configuration file – see example below).
*   **Discrepancy Detection & Alerting:** If a mismatch is detected exceeding a predefined threshold (configurable per parameter), an alert is triggered.  Alert severity is determined by the importance of the mismatched parameter (e.g., network configuration > cosmetic setting).
*   **Automated Rollback (Optional):** Based on severity and pre-configured policy, the system can automatically attempt to restore the primary VM’s configuration to match the shadow. This would require careful handling to avoid data loss.
*   **Historical Shadowing:**  Maintain multiple shadow instances representing configuration states at different points in time. This allows for a richer understanding of configuration drift and facilitates more granular rollback options.

**Configuration File Example (monitoring_config.yml):**

```yaml
parameters:
  - name: network_interface_0_ip_address
    path: /sys/class/net/eth0/address #Linux example - adapt for OS
    tolerance: 0 #No tolerance - exact match required
    severity: critical
  - name: dns_server_1
    path: /etc/resolv.conf #Adapt for OS
    tolerance: 0
    severity: high
  - name: hostname
    path: /etc/hostname
    tolerance: 0
    severity: medium
  - name: timezone
    path: /etc/timezone
    tolerance: 0
    severity: low
```

**Pseudocode (Discrepancy Detection):**

```
function check_discrepancy(parameter_name, primary_value, shadow_value, tolerance, severity):
  difference = abs(primary_value - shadow_value)
  if difference > tolerance:
    log_event(
      severity = severity,
      parameter = parameter_name,
      primary_value = primary_value,
      shadow_value = shadow_value,
      difference = difference
    )
    # Optionally trigger rollback procedures
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Primary VM and Shadow VM are created.
2.  Monitoring agent on each VM collects configuration data based on `monitoring_config.yml`.
3.  Data is compared.
4.  Discrepancies are logged and alerts triggered.
5.  Rollback procedures (optional) are initiated.
