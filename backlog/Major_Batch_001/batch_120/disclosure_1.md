## Adaptive Router Persona System

**Concept:** Introduce the concept of "Router Personas" – pre-defined, configurable behavioral profiles for routers within the network. These personas go beyond basic configuration modules and rules; they dynamically alter router behavior based on real-time network conditions and predicted traffic patterns.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Definitions:** Personas are defined as YAML or JSON files containing configurations for:
    *   QoS parameters (prioritization, bandwidth allocation).
    *   Routing algorithm weighting (OSPF, BGP, etc.).
    *   Security policies (firewall rules, intrusion detection thresholds).
    *   Traffic shaping rules.
    *   Logging levels and destinations.
    *   Interface-specific settings.
    *   Predictive behavior triggers (based on time, event, or metric).
*   **Persona Manager Module:** A software module residing on each router responsible for:
    *   Receiving persona definitions from a central server (or distributed source).
    *   Applying and switching between active personas.
    *   Monitoring network conditions (latency, bandwidth, packet loss).
    *   Analyzing traffic patterns using machine learning models.
    *   Dynamically adjusting persona activation based on analysis and pre-defined rules.
*   **Dynamic Persona Activation Logic:**
    ```pseudocode
    function activatePersona(router, persona, conditions) {
      if (conditionsMet(router, persona.activationConditions)) {
        applyPersonaConfiguration(router, persona);
        log("Activated persona: " + persona.name + " on router: " + router.id);
      }
    }

    function conditionsMet(router, conditions) {
      //Conditions are a list of key-value pairs
      for (condition in conditions) {
        if (condition.metric == "bandwidthUsage") {
          if (router.bandwidthUsage > condition.threshold) {
            return true;
          }
        }
        if (condition.metric == "latencyToDestination") {
          if (router.latencyToDestination[condition.destination] > condition.threshold) {
            return true;
          }
        }
      }
      return false;
    }
    ```
*   **Persona Repository:** A central server/distributed database storing a library of pre-defined personas. This repository is accessible to all routers in the network. Examples:
    *   “High-Throughput”: Optimizes for maximum bandwidth, prioritizing bulk data transfer.
    *   “Low-Latency”: Minimizes latency, ideal for real-time applications like VoIP or video conferencing.
    *   “Security-Focused”: Enforces strict security policies, limiting access and monitoring traffic.
    *   “IoT-Dedicated”: Configures the router for handling a large number of low-bandwidth IoT devices.
*   **Behavioral Prediction Engine:** Integrates with the Persona Manager to predict future network demands. This uses historical data and real-time monitoring to anticipate traffic spikes and proactively switch to the appropriate persona.
*   **Remote Persona Override:** Allows network administrators to remotely override the active persona on a router for troubleshooting or emergency situations.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** Enables administrators to deploy different personas to different routers to test their effectiveness and optimize network performance.

**Implementation Details:**

*   Personas are versioned to ensure consistency and facilitate rollback.
*   The Persona Manager uses a lightweight protocol (e.g., gRPC) for communication with the central repository.
*   The system supports granular control over persona activation, allowing different personas to be applied to different interfaces or VLANs.
*   Security is paramount. Persona definitions are digitally signed to prevent tampering.
