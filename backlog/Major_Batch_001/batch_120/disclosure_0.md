## Dynamic Configuration Blueprinting

**Concept:** Extend the configuration service to support a blueprinting system where configurations arenâ€™t just *applied* to instances, but dynamically *evolve* based on instance runtime data and external triggers. This moves beyond static configuration to a self-modifying system.

**Specs:**

*   **Configuration Blueprint Definition:** A new file format (e.g., `.cbp`) for defining configuration blueprints. This format would contain:
    *   A base configuration (similar to the existing configuration files).
    *   Conditional logic blocks. These blocks define modifications to the configuration based on:
        *   Instance runtime metrics (CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, application-specific data).
        *   External events (scheduled times, API calls, messages from other services).
    *   Versioning information for blueprint revisions.

*   **Runtime Monitoring Agent Enhancement:** Modify the existing agent to:
    *   Continuously monitor instance runtime metrics as defined in the blueprint.
    *   Listen for external event triggers.
    *   Evaluate conditional logic blocks based on monitored data and events.
    *   Dynamically apply configuration modifications as determined by the logic.

*   **Configuration Server API Extensions:**
    *   API endpoint to store and retrieve configuration blueprints.
    *   API endpoint to trigger blueprint re-evaluation on an instance (e.g., force an update check).
    *   API endpoint for version control of blueprints.

*   **Blueprint Evaluation Engine (within agent):**
    *   A dedicated component within the agent responsible for parsing and evaluating blueprint logic.
    *   Supports a simple scripting language (Lua, Python) for defining conditional logic.
    *   Sandboxed execution environment to prevent malicious code execution.

*   **Configuration Diffing and Rollback:**
    *   Mechanism to track changes made to the configuration by the blueprint system.
    *   Ability to rollback to a previous configuration state if a change causes issues.

**Pseudocode (Agent side - Blueprint evaluation loop):**

```
loop:
    metrics = get_instance_metrics()
    events = check_for_external_events()

    blueprint = get_current_blueprint()

    for condition in blueprint.conditional_blocks:
        if evaluate(condition.expression, metrics, events):
            apply_configuration_change(condition.change)

    sleep(configuration.evaluation_interval)
    goto loop
```

**Example Blueprint (`.cbp`):**

```
# Base Configuration
[Section: WebServer]
Port = 80
MaxConnections = 100

[Section: Database]
ConnectionPoolSize = 10

# Conditional Blocks
[Condition: HighCPUUsage]
Expression = "metrics.cpu_usage > 90"
Change = "[Section: WebServer] MaxConnections = 50"

[Condition: ScheduledMaintenance]
Expression = "events.maintenance_scheduled == True"
Change = "[Section: WebServer] RedirectToMaintenancePage = True"
```

This system allows for instances to automatically adapt to changing workloads and events, optimizing performance, security, and availability. It moves beyond configuration *management* to configuration *orchestration*.
