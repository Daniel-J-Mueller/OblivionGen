## Secure Biometric Display Layer

**Concept:** Expand the dual-layer display concept to incorporate live biometric authentication directly into a dedicated display layer, creating a constantly verifying security shield.

**Specs:**

*   **Display Stack:** Multi-layer OLED/MicroLED display. Layer 1 (Base): Standard user interface display (controlled by primary processor). Layer 2 (Security): Transparent, high-resolution layer for biometric authentication and overlay.
*   **Biometric Sensor Integration:**  Integrated array of micro-optical sensors (e.g., vein pattern, iris, facial feature mapping) *within* the security layer.  These aren't cameras in the traditional sense, but proximity-based sensors capable of capturing detailed biological data.
*   **Dedicated Hardware:**  Secure Enclave/Hardware Security Module (HSM) dedicated to processing biometric data within the second layer circuitry. No raw biometric data leaves this enclave.
*   **Dynamic Authentication Mask:** The security layer renders a dynamic, visually subtle “mask” or pattern across the display. This pattern isn't static; it changes rapidly based on biometric readings and environmental conditions.  This makes visual spoofing extremely difficult.  The user doesn't consciously *see* the pattern as a security feature, making it unobtrusive.
*   **Authentication Trigger:**  Continuous, passive authentication.  The system constantly verifies the authorized user’s biometrics.  Access is granted or revoked dynamically based on real-time authentication status.
*   **Data Channel:** One-way communication from the secure biometric enclave to the primary processor indicating authentication status (Pass/Fail). No information *about* the biometric data is transmitted.
*   **Power Source:** Separate, dedicated power supply for the security layer circuitry.

**Pseudocode (Authentication Loop):**

```
// Security Layer Firmware
while (true) {
    biometricData = readBiometricSensors();
    authenticationResult = verifyBiometricData(biometricData, authorizedProfile);

    if (authenticationResult == PASS) {
        sendAuthenticationStatus(PASS);
        updateDynamicMask(authorizedProfile); // Render the appropriate dynamic mask
    } else {
        sendAuthenticationStatus(FAIL);
        clearDynamicMask(); // Clear the mask to indicate failed authentication
        // Potentially initiate lockout or alert sequence
    }

    delay(50ms); // Adjust delay for optimal performance
}

// Primary Processor
while (true) {
    authStatus = receiveAuthenticationStatus();

    if (authStatus == FAIL) {
        // Lock the device, show an alert, etc.
    } else {
        // Allow normal operation
    }
}
```

**Innovation:** The system isn't just *checking* biometrics on login; it's constantly verifying the user’s identity as long as the device is powered on and in use.  The dynamic mask provides a subtle visual indicator of security while making spoofing significantly harder. The continuous authentication stream minimizes session hijacking risk.
