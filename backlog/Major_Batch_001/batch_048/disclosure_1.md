**Dynamic Character Resonance Mapping for Predictive Narrative Engagement**

**Core Concept:** Extend the character graph analysis within the patent to create a dynamic, predictive model of reader/viewer emotional resonance with characters, influencing not just maturity level assessment, but also *suggesting* narrative alterations to maximize engagement.

**Specifications:**

**1. Resonance Vector Generation:**

*   **Input:** Text string (story passage, script line, etc.), Character Graph (as outlined in patent claims 4 & 6), existing reader/viewer engagement data (if available – e.g., facial expression analysis during viewing, reading speed, emotional tagging of responses).
*   **Process:**  For each character node in the graph:
    *   Analyze linguistic elements (verbs, adjectives, dialogue) *associated* with the character’s actions and interactions.
    *   Map these elements to a pre-defined “Emotional Palette” (a multi-dimensional space representing core emotions – joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, etc. - with nuanced sub-categories).  Each linguistic element contributes a weighted vector in this space.
    *   Aggregate vectors from all actions/interactions to generate a “Resonance Vector” for the character.  This vector represents the character's *emotional signature* at that point in the narrative.
    *   Normalize the Resonance Vector to account for story length and complexity.
*   **Output:** A time-series of Resonance Vectors for each character, representing their evolving emotional impact over the narrative.

**2. Engagement Prediction Model:**

*   **Input:**  Time-series of Resonance Vectors, reader/viewer demographic data (if available), historical engagement data (from similar narratives).
*   **Process:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory network) to predict reader/viewer engagement (e.g., emotional response intensity, attention span, likelihood of continuing) based on the evolution of Resonance Vectors. The model should learn which patterns of emotional change are most effective at capturing and maintaining attention.
*   **Output:** A predictive engagement score for each point in the narrative.

**3. Narrative Alteration Engine:**

*   **Input:** Predictive engagement score, Narrative Alteration Parameters (a set of adjustable levers controlling character actions, dialogue, scene pacing, etc.).
*   **Process:** Employ a Reinforcement Learning agent to iteratively adjust the Narrative Alteration Parameters to *maximize* the predictive engagement score.  The agent should explore different combinations of parameters and learn which changes are most effective at boosting engagement.  Alterations could include:
    *   Adding or removing emotional beats.
    *   Changing character motivations.
    *   Adjusting the pacing of scenes.
    *   Introducing new conflicts or resolutions.
*   **Output:** Suggested narrative alterations, ranked by predicted impact on engagement.  These could be presented to a writer/director as suggestions, or automated in a generative storytelling system.

**4.  Contextual Resonance Blending:**

*   **Input:** Multiple Resonance Vectors (characters), Scene Context (setting, time, mood)
*   **Process:**  Apply weighted blending to the Resonance Vectors based on Scene Context.  For example, in a tense action scene, amplify the fear and anger vectors. In a romantic scene, amplify joy and affection vectors.
*   **Output:**  A blended Resonance Vector representing the overall emotional tone of the scene.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
FOR each character IN story:
    FOR each action IN character.actions:
        emotional_vector = analyze_text(action.text)
        character.resonance_vector += emotional_vector

    character.resonance_vector = normalize(character.resonance_vector)

FOR each scene IN story:
    scene_context = analyze_scene(scene.text)
    blended_vector = blend_resonance_vectors(character_vectors, scene_context)
    engagement_score = predict_engagement(blended_vector)

    IF engagement_score < threshold:
        suggest_alterations(scene, engagement_score)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Automated story editing to improve engagement.
*   Personalized narrative experiences tailored to individual emotional preferences.
*   Predictive analysis of audience reaction to scripts and storyboards.
*   Creation of more emotionally resonant characters and narratives.
