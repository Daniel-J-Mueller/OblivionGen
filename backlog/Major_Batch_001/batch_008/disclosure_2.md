## Dynamic Category Merging & Predictive Subcategory Generation

**Concept:** Extend the categorical search refinement by not just *removing* redundant subcategories, but *merging* related categories dynamically and *predicting* potentially relevant subcategories *before* the user explicitly requests them. This moves beyond simply refining existing results to proactively shaping the search space.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Structure: Category Affinity Graph**

*   A graph database will store relationships between all searchable categories.
*   Nodes represent individual categories (e.g., "Running Shoes," "Trail Running," "Minimalist Shoes").
*   Edges represent the strength of association between categories, determined by:
    *   Co-occurrence in user search histories.
    *   Product attribute similarities (extracted from product descriptions via NLP).
    *   Explicitly defined category hierarchies (maintained by category managers).
*   Edge weights are dynamically updated based on real-time user behavior.

**2. Category Merge Algorithm**

*   When a user selects a primary category, identify neighboring categories in the Affinity Graph with edge weights exceeding a threshold (tunable parameter).
*   Combine these neighboring categories into a "Merged Category."  This is *not* a simple OR operation. The system must understand overlapping attributes. For example:
    *   User selects "Running Shoes."
    *   Neighboring categories: "Trail Running," "Minimalist Shoes."
    *   Merged Category: "Running Shoes (including Trail & Minimalist options)" – presented to the user as a single filter/facet.
*   Search results are then drawn from across all contributing categories to the Merged Category.

**3. Predictive Subcategory Generation**

*   As the user types a query, concurrently analyze the query against the Category Affinity Graph.
*   Identify potential subcategories *before* the user explicitly requests them.  These are scored based on:
    *   Query term relevance to the subcategory.
    *   Proximity of the subcategory to the initially selected category in the Affinity Graph.
    *   Historical user engagement with the subcategory in similar queries.
*   Present these predictive subcategories as "Suggested Filters" or "Refine by…" options *above the fold* in the search results page.
*   These suggestions update dynamically as the user refines their query.

**4. Result Display & Ranking**

*   The standard search results grid is maintained.
*   A prominent "Category Summary" banner displays the currently selected category (or Merged Category).
*   Within the Category Summary, display a dynamic list of relevant subcategories, highlighting those suggested by the Predictive Subcategory Generation module.
*   Results are ranked based on:
    *   Relevance to the search query.
    *   Membership in the selected category and subcategories.
    *   A “Diversity Score” – ensuring that results are not dominated by a single brand or subcategory within the Merged Category.

**5.  Pseudocode (Predictive Subcategory Generation):**

```
FUNCTION generatePredictiveSubcategories(searchQuery, selectedCategory):
  // 1. Get neighboring categories from Affinity Graph
  neighborCategories = getNeighborCategories(selectedCategory)

  // 2. Calculate relevance score for each neighbor
  FOR each neighborCategory IN neighborCategories:
    relevanceScore = calculateRelevanceScore(searchQuery, neighborCategory)

  // 3. Sort neighbors by relevance score (descending)
  sortedNeighbors = sort(sortedNeighbors, relevanceScore, descending)

  // 4. Return top N neighbors (configurable)
  RETURN sortedNeighbors[0:N]
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateRelevanceScore(searchQuery, category):
  // Combine term frequency, inverse document frequency, and graph proximity.
  termFrequency = calculateTermFrequency(searchQuery, category)
  inverseDocumentFrequency = calculateInverseDocumentFrequency(category)
  graphProximity = getGraphProximity(category, selectedCategory)
  relevanceScore = (termFrequency * inverseDocumentFrequency) + graphProximity
  RETURN relevanceScore
END FUNCTION
```

**6.  System Components:**

*   **Search Index:** Existing search infrastructure (e.g., Elasticsearch, Solr).
*   **Category Affinity Graph Database:**  Neo4j or similar.
*   **NLP Engine:** For extracting product attributes and calculating text relevance.
*   **Recommendation Engine:**  For personalizing subcategory suggestions based on user history.
*   **API Layer:** To integrate all components and serve search results to the front end.
