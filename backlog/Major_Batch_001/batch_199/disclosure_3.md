## Adjustable Modular Robotics & Integrated Lighting

**Concept:** Expand the adjustable storage system beyond simple shelving to incorporate small, modular robotic arms integrated directly *within* the light strips. These arms would assist in item placement and retrieval, responding to the same input signals that control the lighting, and leveraging the defined storage area lengths.

**Specifications:**

*   **Modular Robotic Arm Units:**
    *   Dimensions: 15cm x 5cm x 5cm (approximate, designed for integration within standard light strip housings).
    *   Degrees of Freedom: 3 (vertical lift, horizontal extension/retraction, rotation).
    *   Payload Capacity: 500g - 1kg (sufficient for most common warehouse/storage items).
    *   Actuation: Miniature servo motors or linear actuators.
    *   Power:  Draw power from the existing light strip power supply (low voltage DC).
    *   Communication: Wireless communication module (Bluetooth or Zigbee) for receiving instructions.
*   **Light Strip Integration:**
    *   Robotic arm units are seamlessly integrated into the light strip housing at regular intervals (e.g., every 30cm).
    *   The light strip serves as both a structural support and a power/data conduit for the robotic arms.
    *   A standardized connector interface allows for easy addition or removal of robotic arm units.
*   **Control System:**
    *   The existing control system is expanded to include robotic arm control functionality.
    *   Input signals from the confirmation devices (buttons) now also control the robotic arms.
    *   **Pseudocode:**
        ```
        on button_press(button_id):
            # Identify the corresponding storage area
            storage_area_id = button_id

            # Activate lights for the corresponding storage area
            activate_lights(storage_area_id)

            # Retrieve item location from inventory system
            item_location = get_item_location(item_id)

            # If item_location is within the activated storage area:
            if item_location.storage_area == storage_area_id:
                # Activate robotic arm nearest to item location
                arm = find_nearest_arm(item_location)
                # Command arm to move to item location and retrieve item
                arm.retrieve_item()
            else:
                # Indicate item is in the wrong storage area (visual/auditory cue)
                display_error("Item in wrong location")
        ```
*   **Safety Features:**
    *   Obstacle detection sensors on each robotic arm.
    *   Emergency stop button.
    *   Software limits to prevent arm movement beyond safe operating range.
*   **Inventory Integration:**
    *   The control system integrates with an existing inventory tracking system to obtain item location data.
    *   The robotic arms can be used to automatically update item locations in the inventory system as items are moved.
*   **Adjustable Shelf Adaptations:**
    *   The modular design allows robotic arms to be incorporated into existing adjustable shelving systems.
    *   The moveable divider can be adjusted to change the size of the storage areas, and the robotic arms will automatically adapt to the new configuration.



This system turns the storage area into an automated fulfillment system, enhancing the efficiency of picking, stowing, and inventory management. The integration with lighting provides clear visual cues for both workers and robots, further streamlining the process.
