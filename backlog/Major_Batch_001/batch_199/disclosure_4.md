## Dynamic Service Image Composition & Orchestration

**Concept:** Extend the service image marketplace to allow *composition* of service images into larger, multi-component applications, and automate the orchestration of these composed applications.  Instead of just deploying a single image, users define a workflow of interconnected service images.

**Specifications:**

**1. Composition Language:**

*   **Format:** YAML-based declarative language.
*   **Elements:**
    *   `application_name`: String – Unique identifier for the composed application.
    *   `services`: List of service definitions.
        *   `name`: String – Unique name for the service instance.
        *   `image`: String – Reference to a service image from the marketplace.
        *   `version`: String – Specific version of the service image.
        *   `configuration`: Dictionary –  Configuration parameters for the service image.  (Passed to the image during startup)
        *   `dependencies`: List of strings – Names of other services this service depends on.  (Used for orchestration)
        *   `ports`: List of integer – Ports exposed by the service.
        *   `resources`: Dictionary – Resource requests/limits (CPU, memory, etc.)
*   **Example:**

```yaml
application_name: "Web Application with Database"
services:
  - name: "web_server"
    image: "nginx_latest"
    version: "1.23"
    configuration:
      port: 80
    dependencies: ["database"]
    ports: [80]
    resources:
      cpu: "1"
      memory: "2GB"
  - name: "database"
    image: "postgres_latest"
    version: "14"
    configuration:
      user: "admin"
      password: "secure_password"
    ports: [5432]
    resources:
      cpu: "0.5"
      memory: "1GB"
```

**2. Orchestration Engine:**

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Parse the composition language definition.
    *   Dynamically provision virtual computing device instances for each service image.
    *   Configure network connectivity between service instances based on dependencies.
    *   Manage service lifecycle (start, stop, scale, update).
    *   Health checking and automated recovery.
*   **Implementation:**  Leverage existing container orchestration technologies (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) as a backend.  The orchestration engine acts as an abstraction layer, simplifying the complexity of these technologies for users.
*   **Scaling:**  Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on metrics exposed by service images.

**3. Service Image Metadata Extension:**

*   **New Metadata Fields:**
    *   `dependencies`: List of other service image names that this image requires to function.  (Used for validation during composition)
    *   `exposed_metrics`: List of metrics exposed by the service image. (Used for monitoring and autoscaling)
    *    `health_check_endpoint`: URL for performing health checks.
    *   `resource_profile`: Recommended resource allocation (CPU, memory).

**4. API Extensions:**

*   `POST /applications`: Create a new application from a composition definition.
*   `GET /applications/{application_id}`: Get the status and configuration of an application.
*   `DELETE /applications/{application_id}`: Delete an application.
*   `POST /applications/{application_id}/scale`: Scale a service within an application.
*   `GET /metrics/{application_id}/{service_name}`: Retrieve metrics for a specific service.

**5. User Interface Enhancements:**

*   Visual composer for creating application workflows.
*   Real-time monitoring of application health and performance.
*   Graphical representation of service dependencies.
*   Alerting and notifications based on predefined thresholds.
