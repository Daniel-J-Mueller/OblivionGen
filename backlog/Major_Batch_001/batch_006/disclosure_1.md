## Dynamic Workload Profiling & Predictive Resource Allocation - "Chameleon"

**Concept:** Extend the predictive resource allocation to incorporate *real-time* workload profiling, not just job characteristics, and leverage a 'Chameleon' system to proactively tailor processing units *beyond* pre-defined levels. This goes beyond simply adding or subtracting units â€“ it's about dynamically *morphing* those units.

**Specs:**

*   **Workload Profiler:** A module continuously analyzes incoming transcoding jobs, extracting features beyond simple complexity/duration. Includes:
    *   **Content Analysis:** Basic scene detection, motion vectors, color palettes (identifies computationally intensive segments).
    *   **Codec Fingerprinting:** Detects nuances in codec implementation, optimizing resource allocation for specific encoder variations.
    *   **Historical Performance:** Tracks performance of similar jobs, weighting predictions based on past data.
*   **Chameleon Processing Units (CPUs):**
    *   CPUs are composed of modular processing blocks (e.g., encoding cores, scaling engines, color correction units).
    *   These blocks can be dynamically reconfigured via software control.
    *   CPUs possess a 'flexibility score' indicating how much re-configuration is possible without impacting stability.
*   **Dynamic Allocation Engine:**
    *   Receives workload profile data & current system load.
    *   Predicts resource needs *per frame* or short video segment (rather than entire job).
    *   **Reconfiguration Logic:** Based on predictions, reconfigures CPUs.
        *   High motion/complexity -> Allocate more encoding cores.
        *   Simple scene -> Disable encoding cores, utilize for scaling/color correction.
        *   Codec-specific optimization -> Enable/disable specific hardware acceleration blocks.
    *   Prioritizes reconfiguration based on CPU 'flexibility score' & cost of switching.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Main Loop
For Each Incoming Job:
    Extract Job Characteristics (Codec, Resolution, Duration)
    Analyze Content (Scene Detection, Motion Vectors)
    Predict Resource Needs Per Segment
    
    For Each CPU:
        Calculate 'Reconfiguration Cost' (Based on current state & predicted needs)
        If Reconfiguration Cost < Benefit:
            Reconfigure CPU (Allocate/Deallocate Processing Blocks)
            Update CPU 'Flexibility Score'
            
        Else:
            Utilize CPU at current configuration
            
    Process Job Segment
    
End For
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   CPUs with modular, software-configurable processing blocks.
*   High-speed interconnect between CPUs & memory.
*   Dedicated hardware for content analysis (scene detection, motion vector calculation).

**Software Requirements:**

*   Workload Profiler module.
*   Dynamic Allocation Engine.
*   CPU Configuration Manager.
*   Monitoring & Logging System.
