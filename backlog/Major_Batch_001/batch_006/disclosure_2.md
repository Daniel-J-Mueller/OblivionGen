## Adaptive Packet Prioritization via Dynamic Resource Allocation

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A resource allocation manager (RAM) operating within the SoC.
*   **Memory Architecture:** Expanded physical memory map, partitioned into dynamically adjustable segments. Segments dedicated to: Switching Program, Kernel, Control Packet Buffer, Communication Packet Buffer, and a 'Contention Reserve'.
*   **Processor Cores:** Utilize multi-core architecture â€“ dedicated cores for Switching and Kernel functions where feasible. Otherwise, time-slicing or hardware-assisted context switching.
*   **Network Interfaces:** Maintain existing dual-port configuration (as in the provided patent). Add a hardware-based packet classification engine.
*   **Interrupt Handling:** Prioritized interrupt scheme. Control plane interrupts (switching) preempt data plane interrupts (communication).
*   **Real-Time Clock (RTC):** Integrated RTC for precise timestamping of packets.

**Operational Description:**

The system operates by dynamically allocating physical memory resources based on real-time traffic analysis and a priority scheme. 

1.  **Packet Classification:** Incoming packets are classified based on type (control/communication), source/destination address, and quality of service (QoS) markings. The hardware packet classification engine performs this rapidly.

2.  **Traffic Monitoring:** The RAM continuously monitors the rate of control and communication packets. This monitoring includes tracking buffer occupancy levels.

3.  **Resource Adjustment:** 
    *   If control packet rates exceed a threshold, the RAM dynamically increases the memory allocated to the Switching Program and Control Packet Buffer, taking resources from the Communication Packet Buffer and, if necessary, the Contention Reserve.
    *   Conversely, if communication packet rates are high and control traffic is low, resources are shifted to the Kernel and Communication Packet Buffer.
    *   The Contention Reserve acts as a buffer to prevent complete starvation of either plane during peak loads.
    *   Resource adjustments are performed using memory management unit (MMU) remapping, ensuring seamless transition without packet loss.

4.  **Prioritization:** The processor prioritizes the execution of the Switching Program over the Kernel when contention occurs. This is achieved through a combination of interrupt prioritization and memory protection mechanisms.

5.  **Timestamping:** Each packet is timestamped upon arrival. This timestamp data is used for:
    *   Traffic analysis and performance monitoring.
    *   Identification of potential congestion points.
    *   Real-time adjustment of resource allocation parameters.

**Pseudocode (RAM Core Logic):**

```pseudocode
// Global Variables
control_packet_rate = 0
communication_packet_rate = 0
control_buffer_occupancy = 0
communication_buffer_occupancy = 0
memory_map // Represents the current memory allocation

FUNCTION adjust_memory_map()
    IF control_packet_rate > CONTROL_THRESHOLD AND control_buffer_occupancy > CONTROL_BUFFER_THRESHOLD THEN
        // Reduce communication buffer size, increase control buffer size
        transferMemory(COMMUNICATION_BUFFER, CONTROL_BUFFER, amount)
    ELSE IF communication_packet_rate > COMMUNICATION_THRESHOLD AND communication_buffer_occupancy > COMMUNICATION_BUFFER_THRESHOLD THEN
        // Reduce control buffer size, increase communication buffer size
        transferMemory(CONTROL_BUFFER, COMMUNICATION_BUFFER, amount)
    ENDIF

    // Adjust memory map to reflect changes
    updateMemoryMap(memory_map)
ENDFUNCTION

// Main Loop
WHILE(TRUE)
    control_packet_rate = monitorControlPacketRate()
    communication_packet_rate = monitorCommunicationPacketRate()
    control_buffer_occupancy = monitorControlBufferOccupancy()
    communication_buffer_occupancy = monitorCommunicationBufferOccupancy()

    adjust_memory_map()

    // Optional: Implement predictive adjustment based on historical data

ENDWHILE
```

**Expansion Considerations:**

*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Implement a machine learning model to predict traffic patterns and proactively adjust resource allocation.
*   **Fine-Grained QoS Control:** Extend the packet classification engine to support more granular QoS markings and implement differentiated service (DiffServ) policies.
*   **Security Enhancement:** Integrate intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) functionality into the switching program to protect against malicious traffic.
*   **Energy Optimization:** Dynamically adjust clock speeds and voltage levels based on traffic load to reduce power consumption.
