## Dynamic Hash Function Selection for Power-Aware Routing

**Concept:** Extend the power domain configuration system to dynamically select hash functions *within* each hash table based on load and power constraints. Different hash functions offer trade-offs between computational complexity (power consumption) and collision rates (performance). This system will learn to choose the ‘right’ hash function for each power domain configuration *and* dynamically adjust based on real-time traffic patterns.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware Components:**
    *   Routing Table Memory (SRAM preferred, as noted in the patent)
    *   Hash Function Execution Units (multiple, dedicated hardware blocks for different hash functions – e.g., CRC32, MurmurHash, CityHash)
    *   Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) – collects statistics on collision rates, lookup times, and power consumption.
    *   Control Logic – Implements the dynamic hash function selection algorithm.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Hash Function Library – Contains implementations of various hash functions.
    *   Learning Algorithm – Reinforcement learning agent or similar, trained to optimize hash function selection. Reward function based on a weighted combination of lookup performance (low latency) and power consumption.
    *   Configuration Database – Stores the optimal hash function mapping for each power domain configuration, learned through training.

**Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
// Initialization
For each power domain configuration:
    Initialize hash function mapping to a default hash function.

// Runtime Operation
On each lookup request:
    Determine current power domain configuration.
    Retrieve associated hash function from the configuration database.
    Compute hash using the retrieved hash function.
    Perform lookup in the hash table.

// Background Learning (executed periodically)
For each power domain configuration:
    Collect performance metrics (collision rate, lookup time, power consumption) using PMU.
    Calculate reward based on performance metrics.
    Update hash function mapping using reinforcement learning algorithm.
    If a new hash function yields a higher reward, replace the current mapping.

//Power Domain Configuration Switch
On power domain configuration switch:
    Load new hash function mapping associated with the new configuration.
    Flush hash table entries (optional, depending on the hash function).
```

*   **Hash Function Selection Criteria:**
    *   **Complexity:** Measured in terms of CPU cycles or energy consumption.
    *   **Collision Rate:** Lower collision rates improve lookup performance.
    *   **Distribution:** The hash function should distribute keys uniformly across the hash table.
*   **Learning Algorithm Details:**
    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** Q-learning or a similar algorithm, with states representing power domain configurations and actions representing hash function selections.
    *   **Reward Function:** `Reward = w1 * (1 / LookupTime) + w2 * (1 / PowerConsumption)`.  Adjust `w1` and `w2` to prioritize performance or power savings.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `PowerDomainConfiguration` struct: `{PowerDomainID, HashFunctionID, LastUpdatedTimestamp}`
    *   `HashFunctionMetadata` struct: `{HashFunctionID, Complexity, CollisionRate}`

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced power consumption by utilizing simpler hash functions when high performance is not critical.
*   Improved performance by selecting more complex hash functions when needed.
*   Adaptability to changing traffic patterns.
*   Optimized routing table operation across all power domain configurations.
