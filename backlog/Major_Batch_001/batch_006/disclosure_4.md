## Temporal Key Shards & Dynamic Reconstruction

**Concept:** Instead of a single backup key with a fixed lifetime, implement a system where a cryptographic key is *sharded* – broken into multiple components. Each component is encrypted under a unique key with an independent, shorter lifespan. Reconstruction of the original key requires gathering and decrypting all shards *before* their individual lifespans expire. This adds a layer of temporal complexity and granular control over key availability.

**Specs:**

*   **Sharding Algorithm:** Employ a Secret Sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing) to generate 'n' shards from the original key. 'k' shards are required for reconstruction (k < n).
*   **Shard Encryption:** Each shard is encrypted using a unique key derived from a master key.
*   **Temporal Keys:** Each shard's decryption key is itself encrypted using a temporal key with a dynamically assigned lifespan. These lifespans are staggered – not all expire simultaneously.
*   **Distributed Storage:** Shards and their corresponding temporal key encryptions are distributed across geographically diverse, offline storage locations.
*   **Reconstruction Trigger:** An API endpoint allows for a "reconstruct key" request. Upon request, the system initiates a coordinated effort to retrieve and decrypt each shard's temporal key, then reconstruct the original key.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:**  Continuously monitor the remaining lifespan of each shard's temporal key.  Alert administrators when a key is nearing expiration to ensure timely reconstruction if needed.
*   **Automated Reconstruction:** Implement a scheduled job to proactively attempt reconstruction of keys nearing the expiration of *any* shard. This pre-emptive approach minimizes downtime.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Process):**

```
FUNCTION reconstructKey(keyID):
  // 1. Retrieve Shard Locations
  shardLocations = getShardLocations(keyID)

  // 2. Gather Shard Data & Temporal Keys
  shardData = []
  temporalKeys = []
  FOR EACH location IN shardLocations:
    shardData.append(retrieveShard(location))
    temporalKeys.append(retrieveTemporalKey(location))

  // 3. Decrypt Temporal Keys
  decryptedTemporalKeys = []
  FOR EACH key IN temporalKeys:
    decryptedTemporalKeys.append(decrypt(key, masterKey))

  // 4. Decrypt Shards
  decryptedShards = []
  FOR i FROM 0 TO LENGTH(decryptedTemporalKeys):
    decryptedShards.append(decrypt(shardData[i], decryptedTemporalKeys[i]))

  // 5. Reconstruct Original Key
  originalKey = reconstructKeyFromShards(decryptedShards)

  RETURN originalKey
```

**Innovation:** The staggered lifespan of shards and temporal keys offers superior resilience against key compromise. Even if one or more shards are compromised, reconstruction is still possible as long as a sufficient number of uncompromised shards and their temporal keys remain available. The automated reconstruction feature proactively minimizes downtime and ensures key availability. The design departs from a single point of failure (the backup key) and introduces a distributed, time-sensitive system of key management.
