## Dynamic UI "Shadowing" for Proactive Authentication

**Concept:** Extend behavioral authentication beyond simple access sequences to include *how* a user interacts with UI elements – speed, pressure, micro-movements – and proactively create a "shadow UI" mirroring their typical behavior. Deviations from this shadow UI trigger escalated authentication.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Capture Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time user interaction data. This includes:
    *   Mouse/Touch coordinates
    *   Timestamp of each interaction
    *   Pressure sensitivity (if applicable)
    *   Velocity of movement
    *   Dwell time on UI elements
    *   Keystroke dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, pressure)
*   **Processing:** Normalize data to account for device variations (screen size, DPI).  Filter out jitter and noise.
*   **Output:**  A vectorized representation of each user interaction.  (e.g., a series of (x, y, time, pressure, velocity) tuples for each UI element interacted with).

**2. Shadow UI Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Vectorized interaction data from Data Capture Module, and application UI definition (element types, positions, sizes).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Baseline Creation:** During initial use, collect data for a defined period (e.g., 1 hour) to create a baseline "shadow UI" profile. This profile consists of:
        *   Average interaction vectors for each UI element.
        *   Standard deviation of interaction vectors.
        *   Frequency of interaction with each element.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously update the shadow UI profile based on ongoing user behavior. Implement an exponential moving average to prioritize recent behavior while retaining historical data.
    *   **Contextual Profiles:**  Maintain multiple contextual shadow UI profiles (e.g., “Morning Email”, “Expense Reporting”, “Admin Dashboard”). Context is determined by the current application module or screen.
*   **Output:** A dynamic, vectorized representation of the user's typical UI interaction behavior, organized by context.

**3. Deviation Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time user interaction data (vectorized), current context, dynamic shadow UI profile.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Vector Comparison:** Calculate the Euclidean distance between the current interaction vector and the corresponding average vector in the shadow UI profile.
    *   **Thresholding:** Compare the distance to a dynamically adjusted threshold. The threshold is based on the standard deviation of interaction vectors in the shadow UI profile, and a confidence factor determined by system risk (e.g., accessing financial data).
    *   **Pattern Analysis:**  Detect deviations in interaction *patterns*. For example, unusually rapid clicks, erratic mouse movements, or inconsistent typing rhythms. Use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained on the shadow UI data to identify anomalous sequences.
*   **Output:** A deviation score representing the likelihood that the current interaction is anomalous.

**4. Adaptive Authentication Module:**

*   **Input:** Deviation score, system risk, user profile.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Tiered Authentication:** Implement a tiered authentication system.
        *   **Low Deviation:** No additional authentication.
        *   **Medium Deviation:** Step-up authentication (e.g., SMS code, push notification).
        *   **High Deviation:** Full multi-factor authentication (e.g., biometric scan, security question).
    *   **Adaptive Thresholds:**  Adjust authentication thresholds based on user behavior.  Users with consistent behavior may have higher thresholds.
    *   **Behavioral Biometrics:** Use the accumulated interaction data to build a behavioral biometric profile. This profile can be used to further refine authentication decisions.
*   **Output:** Authentication request (if necessary), access control decision.

**Pseudocode (Deviation Detection):**

```
function detectDeviation(currentInteraction, shadowProfile, context):
  distance = calculateEuclideanDistance(currentInteraction, shadowProfile.averageVectors[currentInteraction.element])
  deviationScore = distance / shadowProfile.standardDeviations[currentInteraction.element]

  // Pattern analysis using HMM
  patternScore = hmm.evaluate(currentInteraction.sequence)

  combinedScore = (deviationScore * 0.7) + (patternScore * 0.3) //Weighted average

  if combinedScore > threshold:
    return "High Deviation"
  elif combinedScore > mediumThreshold:
    return "Medium Deviation"
  else:
    return "Low Deviation"
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond *what* a user does to *how* they do it. By modeling UI interaction dynamics, it creates a more nuanced and adaptive authentication system that is less susceptible to traditional phishing attacks and account takeovers. It also offers a more seamless user experience by minimizing unnecessary authentication requests for users with consistent behavior.
