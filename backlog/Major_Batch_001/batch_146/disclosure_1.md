## Adaptive Semantic Tagging via Dynamic Graph Construction & Propagation

**Core Concept:** Extend the multi-level clustering by moving *beyond* fixed content properties (font size, page location) and instead build a dynamic, evolving graph representing semantic relationships *between* content regions.  This graph is constructed and refined iteratively, allowing for a far more nuanced understanding of document structure.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Content Region Definition:** Utilize a Computer Vision module to identify and delineate content regions beyond simple bounding boxes. This includes identifying tables, lists, headings, images, and other visual elements. Output: list of content regions, each with geometric and visual properties.

2.  **Initial Feature Vector Generation:** Each content region is assigned a feature vector incorporating:
    *   Baseline properties (font size, page location, etc., as in the original patent).
    *   Visual features (image presence/absence, color histograms, edge density).
    *   Textual features (keyword presence, sentence length, part-of-speech tags).

3.  **Dynamic Graph Construction:**
    *   Create a directed graph where nodes represent content regions.
    *   Edges are weighted based on feature vector similarity (using cosine similarity or similar).  Initial edge weight threshold is configurable.
    *   Implement a ‘propagation delay’ parameter to prevent immediate, cascading updates (see ‘Graph Refinement’ below).

4.  **Semantic Classification Module:**  Employ a pre-trained (or trainable) language model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to assign initial semantic tags to a subset of content regions (e.g., manual labeling of a few "seed" regions).

5.  **Graph Refinement (Iterative):**
    *   **Propagation Step:**  For each node with a semantic tag:
        *   Propagate the tag to neighboring nodes (those connected by edges) *after* the ‘propagation delay’ period.
        *   Tag propagation weight is based on edge weight and a ‘confidence transfer’ parameter.
        *   Implement a damping factor to prevent runaway propagation.
    *   **Confidence Update:** After each propagation step, update the confidence score of the semantic tag for each node.
    *   **Edge Weight Adjustment:**
        *   If a propagated tag *matches* the predicted tag for a node, increase the edge weight.
        *   If a propagated tag *conflicts* with the predicted tag, decrease the edge weight.
        *   Implement a learning rate to control the speed of edge weight adjustment.
    *   Repeat the propagation, confidence update, and edge weight adjustment steps for a configurable number of iterations.

6.  **Cluster Formation:**  After graph refinement, use a graph clustering algorithm (e.g., Louvain modularity) to identify clusters of strongly connected content regions with similar semantic tags.

7.  **Cluster Semantic Association:** Assign a semantic classifier to each cluster based on the most frequent semantic tag within the cluster.

**Pseudocode (Graph Refinement Step):**

```
FOR each node 'n' with assigned semantic tag:
  FOR each neighbor 'm' of 'n':
    IF NOT m has semantic tag:
      confidence = edge_weight * confidence_transfer
      assign semantic tag of 'n' to 'm' with confidence 'confidence'
    ELSE:
      IF semantic tag of 'n' == semantic tag of 'm':
        edge_weight = edge_weight * learning_rate_increase
      ELSE:
        edge_weight = edge_weight * learning_rate_decrease
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   GPU acceleration for language model inference and graph operations.
*   Sufficient RAM to store the graph in memory.
*   High-speed storage for accessing the document content.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **User Feedback Integration:** Allow users to correct semantic tag assignments and propagate those corrections through the graph.
*   **Cross-Document Analysis:** Extend the graph to include content regions from multiple documents, enabling knowledge transfer and improved semantic understanding.
*   **Adaptive Propagation Delay:** Dynamically adjust the propagation delay based on the graph’s structure and the confidence of semantic tag assignments.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify content regions with unusually low confidence scores or conflicting semantic tags, potentially indicating errors or inconsistencies in the document.
