## Personalized Trend Decay with Emotional Valence

**Concept:** Expand the trend decay model beyond simple frequency and time-based algorithms. Incorporate emotional valence analysis of content sources *and* user interaction to dynamically adjust trend persistence.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time data streams (news, social media, RSS, podcasts).
*   **Emotional Valence Detection:** Integrate a sentiment analysis engine (or multiple) capable of identifying emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral, anger, joy, sadness, etc.) within text, audio, and potentially video content.  Output a valence score for each data item.
*   **Source Trust & Bias Assessment:** Assign each source a ‘trust’ score (initially based on reputation, user feedback, and fact-checking data). Track source bias (political, emotional slant) via automated analysis and manual curation.
*   **Entity & Topic Extraction:** Standard NLP processes to identify key entities and topics within ingested data.

**2. Dynamic Trend Persistence Engine:**

*   **Baseline Decay:** Implement a standard decay model (e.g., exponential decay) based on time since first detection and frequency of source mentions.
*   **Emotional Valence Modifier:**
    *   Calculate an ‘Emotional Impact Score’ for a trend by weighting the valence scores of contributing content.  Higher positive valence extends persistence; high negative valence accelerates decay.
    *   Implement thresholds:  Trends with consistently *high* negative valence are flagged for rapid decay or potential suppression (user configurable).  Trends with consistent positive valence receive extended persistence.
*   **User Interaction Weighting:**
    *   Track user engagement with trending content (clicks, shares, time spent, expressed sentiment via likes/dislikes/reactions).
    *   Weight the decay rate based on user interaction: High user engagement extends persistence; low engagement accelerates decay.  Personalize this weighting per user profile.
*   **Source Weighting:**  Apply source trust and bias scores to the valence and frequency calculations.  Content from highly trusted, unbiased sources has greater impact on trend persistence.

**3. Personalized Trend Feed Module:**

*   **User Profile:**  Maintain user profiles with preferences (topics of interest, preferred content sources, sentiment sensitivity).
*   **Trend Filtering:** Filter trending topics based on user preferences.
*   **Personalized Decay Rate:**  Apply personalized decay rates based on user preferences and interaction history.  Users with high sentiment sensitivity may experience faster decay of negative trends.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  Employ machine learning to adapt the decay rate based on user behavior.

**Pseudocode (Decay Rate Calculation):**

```
function calculateDecayRate(topic, content, userProfile) {
  baseDecayRate = calculateBaseDecayRate(topic, content); // Standard time/frequency decay
  emotionalImpact = content.valenceScore * userProfile.sentimentSensitivity;
  sourceWeight = content.source.trustScore + (1 - content.source.biasScore);
  userEngagementWeight = getUserEngagementWeight(topic, userProfile);
  decayRate = baseDecayRate * (1 + emotionalImpact * sourceWeight * userEngagementWeight);
  return decayRate;
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-throughput data ingestion pipeline.
*   Scalable sentiment analysis engine.
*   Machine learning platform for personalized learning.
*   Distributed database for storing trend data and user profiles.
*   API for accessing trend data and user preferences.
