## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System Based on Handedness & Motion Prediction

**Core Concept:** Extend handedness detection into predictive motion analysis to proactively adjust haptic feedback characteristics *before* user input, creating a more intuitive and responsive experience.

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensors:** Existing accelerometer & gyroscope data stream (as per the provided patent). Addition of a low-resolution, time-of-flight (ToF) sensor on the device’s bezel/grip area. ToF sensor range: 5-20cm. Resolution: 5x5 pixel array. Update Rate: 30Hz.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated co-processor for real-time analysis of sensor data. Minimum processing power: 500MHz.
*   **Haptic Actuators:** Array of miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) embedded within the device casing. Resolution: 1cm spacing. Amplitude Range: 0-100%. Frequency Range: 50-250Hz.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Handedness & Motion Prediction Engine:** Based on the existing regression and classifier algorithms from the patent, but expanded. Predictive horizon: 200ms.  Output: Probability distribution over possible hand trajectories (position, velocity, acceleration).
    *   **Haptic Profile Database:**  Stores pre-defined haptic feedback profiles optimized for various actions (e.g., button presses, scrolling, notifications). Profiles contain amplitude, frequency, and spatial distribution parameters for the LRAs.
    *   **Dynamic Profile Generator:**  Combines the predicted hand trajectory with the current application context (e.g., game, web browser, messaging app) to dynamically generate a customized haptic profile. This profile will be applied preemptively.
    *   **ToF Data Integration:** Time-of-flight data is used to refine the prediction. The ToF sensor detects the distance of the user’s hand from the device. This information is used to adjust the predicted trajectory.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Accelerometer, gyroscope, and ToF data streams are fed into the processing unit.
    2.  Handedness & Motion Prediction Engine processes the data to predict the user’s hand trajectory.
    3.  Dynamic Profile Generator combines the predicted trajectory with the application context.
    4.  Haptic Actuators are driven based on the generated haptic profile.
*   **Pseudocode (Dynamic Profile Generation):**

```
function generateHapticProfile(predictedTrajectory, applicationContext):
    // Define base profile based on application context
    baseProfile = getBaseProfile(applicationContext)

    //Adjust profile for anticipated action.
    if applicationContext == "gaming":
        if predictedTrajectory.action == "firing":
            baseProfile.amplitude *= 1.5
            baseProfile.frequency = 200
        else if predictedTrajectory.action == "movement":
            baseProfile.spatialDistribution = predictedTrajectory.direction
    else if applicationContext == "messaging":
        baseProfile.amplitude *= 0.8
        baseProfile.frequency = 100
        baseProfile.spatialDistribution = "centered"

    // Adjust profile based on handedness.
    if handedness == "left":
        baseProfile.spatialDistribution = "left_biased"
    else:
        baseProfile.spatialDistribution = "right_biased"

    return baseProfile
```

*   **Calibration Procedure:**  User-specific calibration routine to map hand size, grip strength, and preferred haptic feedback characteristics. Data stored locally on the device.

*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously learns from user interactions, refining its prediction models and haptic profiles over time.
    *   **Multi-User Support:**  Ability to detect and adapt to multiple users, each with their own calibrated profiles.
    *   **Procedural Haptic Generation:**  Using algorithms to create unique and complex haptic experiences on the fly.
