## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Shifting for Low-Power Wireless

**Concept:** Leverage subtle shifts in resonant frequency of the wireless transceiver's antenna to encode short bursts of data *while in* the ultra-low power 'sleep' mode described in the patent. This essentially creates a secondary, extremely low-bandwidth communication channel *without* actively powering up most of the transceiver circuitry.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware Components:**
    *   Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) tunable capacitor integrated into the antenna structure. This capacitor must be capable of extremely fine-grained adjustment with minimal power consumption.
    *   Low-power microcontroller dedicated to controlling the MEMS capacitor. This microcontroller remains active in the lowest possible power state, even when the main processor is asleep.
    *   Dedicated, ultra-low power RF detector circuit on the remote device. This circuit is constantly monitoring for frequency shifts within a narrow band.
*   **Encoding Scheme:**
    *   Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK) with two distinct frequencies: *f0* (capacitor set to baseline value) and *f1* (capacitor slightly adjusted).
    *   Data is encoded in short bursts of *f0* and *f1* representing bits (e.g., short *f0* = '0', short *f1* = '1').
    *   Error correction coding (e.g., Hamming code) is essential due to the limited bandwidth and potential noise.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   **Device A (Sending):** In low-power mode, the main processor instructs the MEMS controller to adjust the capacitor, encoding a short message. This is transmitted passively as a slight frequency shift in the antenna's signal.
    *   **Device B (Receiving):** The RF detector circuit continuously monitors for frequency shifts. Upon detecting a valid signal (verified by error correction), Device B generates an interrupt to the main processor.
    *   **Wake-Up/Handshake:** The received message could be a simple "wake-up" request, or a small amount of data to pre-populate buffers before fully waking the device.
*   **Pseudocode (Device A - Sending):**

```
function sendLowPowerSignal(data):
  // data is a short byte array
  calculateHammingCode(data)  // Apply error correction
  for each bit in correctedData:
    if bit == 0:
      setCapacitorToBaseline()
    else:
      setCapacitorToOffset()
    transmitSignalForShortDuration()
  return
```

*   **Pseudocode (Device B - Receiving):**

```
function monitorFrequencyShifts():
  while(true):
    frequency = detectAntennaFrequency()
    if frequency is within acceptable range:
      bit = decodeFrequency(frequency)
      append bit to receivedDataBuffer
      if receivedDataBuffer contains complete message:
        verifyHammingCode(receivedDataBuffer)
        if Hamming code is valid:
          generateInterrupt()
          return
    end while
```

*   **Power Considerations:**
    *   The MEMS capacitor should be designed for ultra-low power operation during adjustments.
    *   The RF detector circuit on the receiving device must minimize power consumption while maintaining sensitivity.
*   **Potential Use Cases:**
    *   Ultra-low power wake-up signals.
    *   Sending small status updates (e.g., battery level) without fully waking the device.
    *   Implementing a simple "keep-alive" mechanism to maintain a connection.
