## Adaptive Contextual Voice Persona

**System Overview:** A system enabling dynamic voice persona selection for a language processing system based on detected user emotional state *and* inferred social relationship to entities mentioned in a user's utterance. Extends beyond simple emotion detection to model *how* a user would naturally address different people/concepts.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Emotional State Analyzer:** (Existing tech, but crucial) – Detects user emotion (joy, sadness, anger, etc.) from voice/text input.
2.  **Entity/Relationship Extractor:**  Identifies entities (people, organizations, concepts) mentioned in user utterance. Determines *inferred* relationship based on utterance context, known user data, and external knowledge graphs. (e.g., "Talk to my mother" -> identifies ‘mother’ as a familial relationship; “Remind me about the project deadline” -> identifies ‘project’ as work-related).
3.  **Persona Selector:**  Core innovation. Selects a voice persona profile based on the combined output of the Emotional State Analyzer and Entity/Relationship Extractor. Persona profiles are defined by a set of parameters controlling voice characteristics (pitch, tone, speed, accent, vocabulary, formality, even simulated ‘energy’ level).
4.  **Persona Generator/Synthesizer:**  Generates/synthesizes the selected persona’s voice output.  Could leverage existing TTS (Text-to-Speech) technology, but requires fine-grained control over parameters.
5.  **Persona Profile Database:** Stores numerous pre-defined persona profiles, each characterized by parameters defining voice characteristics. Allows creation of custom profiles.

**Data Structures:**

*   **Persona Profile:**
    *   `profile_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `name`: Descriptive name (e.g., "Warm Mother," "Professional Colleague," "Enthusiastic Friend").
    *   `emotional_base`:  Default emotion associated with persona.
    *   `voice_parameters`: (Pitch, Tone, Speed, Accent, Vocabulary, Formality, Energy Level) - Each parameter has a range of values.
    *   `utterance_templates`: Example phrases/sentences to calibrate the persona's speech patterns.
*   **Relationship Model:**
    *   `entity_id`: ID of the entity (person/object).
    *   `relationship_type`: (Familial, Professional, Casual, Romantic, etc.).
    *   `formality_level`: (High, Medium, Low).
    *   `emotional_bias`:  (Positive, Negative, Neutral).

**Workflow:**

1.  User issues a voice command.
2.  Emotional State Analyzer detects user emotion.
3.  Entity/Relationship Extractor identifies entities and infers relationships.
4.  Persona Selector:
    *   Combines emotion and relationship data.
    *   Queries Persona Profile Database for the best matching profile.  (e.g., Sad emotion + Familial relationship -> "Comforting Mother" persona).
5.  Persona Generator/Synthesizer generates audio output using the selected profile.
6.  Audio output is presented to the user.

**Pseudocode (Persona Selector):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION selectPersona(user_emotion, relationship_data):
    //relationship_data is a tuple: (entity_id, relationship_type, formality_level, emotional_bias)

    best_persona = null
    best_score = -1

    FOR EACH persona IN persona_database:
        // Calculate a score based on how well the persona matches the current context
        score = 0

        // Emotion Matching
        IF persona.emotional_base == user_emotion:
            score += 0.5

        // Relationship Matching
        IF persona.relationship_type == relationship_data.relationship_type:
            score += 0.3

        // Formality Matching
        IF persona.formality_level == relationship_data.formality_level:
            score += 0.2

        // Emotional Bias
        IF persona.emotional_bias == relationship_data.emotional_bias:
            score += 0.1

        IF score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_persona = persona

    RETURN best_persona
```

**Novelty:**  While existing systems might adapt voice based on *detected* emotion, this system proactively selects a voice persona based on *how the user would naturally address different people or concepts*. It is about simulating social intelligence in the voice interface.
