## Adaptive Resource Allocation Based on Predictive User Engagement

**Concept:** Extend the existing adaptive memory management to *proactively* adjust resource allocation not just based on background/foreground state and memory pressure, but on *predicted* user engagement with linked processes.  This moves beyond reactive throttling to anticipatory optimization.

**Specifications:**

**I. Engagement Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Process-specific metrics: CPU usage, network activity, disk I/O, memory footprint.
    *   User interaction data:  Mouse movements, keystrokes, scrolling, touch events – all normalized to process windows/contexts.
    *   Time-series data: Historical engagement patterns for each process, user, and time of day.
    *   Contextual data: Location (if permission granted), calendar events, ambient noise (microphone input – optional, permission required).
*   **Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained to predict a future "engagement score" for each process over a short time horizon (e.g., next 5-15 seconds).  The LSTM should be trained *locally* on the user's device to maximize privacy and personalization.
*   **Output:** An engagement score (0.0 – 1.0) for each linked process, updated multiple times per second.

**II. Resource Allocation Manager:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Engagement scores (from Engagement Prediction Module).
    *   Current memory usage of all linked processes.
    *   System load (CPU, disk, network).
    *   Predefined priority levels (High, Medium, Low).
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Weighted Allocation:**  Allocate memory proportionally to engagement score, *within* predefined limits for each priority level.  Processes with higher engagement scores receive more memory.
    2.  **Dynamic Priority Adjustment:** Adjust priority levels dynamically based on predicted engagement.  A process with a rapidly *increasing* engagement score might be temporarily boosted to a higher priority. A process whose engagement score falls below a threshold is temporarily lowered.
    3.  **Budgeting:**  Implement a "resource budget" for the entire set of linked processes. If total predicted resource usage exceeds the budget, reduce allocation proportionally based on engagement scores.  The budget itself can be adjusted based on system load.
    4.  **Pre-fetching & Caching:** Based on high engagement prediction, pre-fetch necessary resources (code, data, assets) into memory or cache, anticipating future usage.

**III. Implementation Details:**

*   **API:**  Expose an API to allow applications to register linked processes and provide metadata (e.g., process type, resource requirements).
*   **Local Training:**  The LSTM model should be trained locally on the user's device using federated learning techniques to preserve privacy.  Model updates can be periodically synchronized with a central server (with user consent).
*   **Low Overhead:**  Optimize the LSTM model and resource allocation algorithm for minimal CPU and memory overhead.
*   **Granularity:** The process granularity can be adjusted depending on the device specifications.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Manager):**

```
function allocateResources(linkedProcesses, engagementScores, systemLoad):
  totalEngagement = sum(engagementScores)
  resourceBudget = calculateResourceBudget(systemLoad)

  for process in linkedProcesses:
    processEngagement = engagementScores[process]
    allocationPercentage = processEngagement / totalEngagement
    allocatedMemory = min(resourceBudget * allocationPercentage, process.maxMemory)
    process.setMemoryLimit(allocatedMemory)
  end
end

function calculateResourceBudget(systemLoad):
  // Implement a function to calculate the resource budget based on system load.
  // For example, decrease the budget if CPU usage is high.
  // return maxMemory - (cpuUsage * scalingFactor)
end
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **User Feedback Integration:** Allow users to provide feedback on resource allocation (e.g., "This app is sluggish"). Use this feedback to refine the engagement prediction model.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Detect unusual engagement patterns that might indicate malicious activity.
*   **Cross-Process Prediction:**  Model relationships between linked processes. For example, if the user starts typing in a web browser, predict increased engagement with the spell checker process.
