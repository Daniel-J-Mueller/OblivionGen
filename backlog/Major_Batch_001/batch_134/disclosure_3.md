## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Code Complexity

**Concept:** The existing system focuses on scaling *capacity* based on concurrent requests. This expands on that by dynamically adjusting resource allocation *within* each execution instance, based on real-time analysis of the code being executed.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Code Complexity Analyzer (CCA):** A module integrated into the frontend service. This module analyzes incoming program code (before execution) and assigns a ‘Complexity Score’ based on factors like:
    *   Cyclomatic Complexity (measure of decision points).
    *   Nesting Depth (depth of loops and conditional statements).
    *   Data Structure Complexity (size and type of data structures used).
    *   External Dependency Count (number of libraries/APIs called).
2.  **Resource Profiles:**  Predefined resource profiles (Small, Medium, Large, Extreme) mapping to varying amounts of CPU, memory, and potentially GPU allocation. Each profile has a corresponding cost.
3.  **Dynamic Allocation Logic:**
    *   Upon receiving a request, the CCA calculates the Complexity Score.
    *   A lookup table maps Complexity Scores to appropriate Resource Profiles.  (e.g., Score 0-10: Small, 11-25: Medium, 26-50: Large, 51+: Extreme).
    *   The frontend service requests the virtual machine instance manager to allocate a VM with the specified Resource Profile.
    *   Execution occurs on the allocated VM.
    *   A monitoring module *during* execution can re-evaluate complexity based on *actual* runtime behavior (e.g., deep recursion, unexpected data growth). If complexity exceeds the initial allocation, a dynamic upgrade to a higher Resource Profile is triggered (with appropriate cost implications).
4.  **Cost Model:**
    *   Each Resource Profile has an associated cost per unit time.
    *   Clients are billed based on the allocated Resource Profile and the duration of execution.
    *   Dynamic upgrades incur additional cost.
5.  **API Extensions:**
    *   An API endpoint allowing clients to *request* a specific Resource Profile (subject to availability and cost).
    *   An API endpoint allowing clients to receive real-time resource usage metrics.

**Pseudocode (Frontend Service):**

```
function handleExecutionRequest(request):
  clientID = request.clientID
  programCode = request.programCode

  complexityScore = CCA.calculateComplexity(programCode)
  resourceProfile = lookupResourceProfile(complexityScore)

  vmRequest = createVMRequest(clientID, resourceProfile)
  vmInstance = VMInstanceManager.allocateVM(vmRequest)

  executionResult = vmInstance.execute(programCode)

  // Monitoring during execution (separate thread)
  monitorExecution(vmInstance) {
    runtimeComplexity = analyzeRuntimeComplexity(vmInstance)
    if (runtimeComplexity > initialComplexity) {
      upgradeVM(vmInstance, higherResourceProfile)
    }
  }

  return executionResult
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems primarily focus on *concurrent* scaling. This introduces a dimension of *intra-execution* scaling, adapting resources to the specific computational demands of the code itself.  This could significantly improve efficiency and reduce costs, particularly for workloads with varying complexity. It could also enable the execution of more complex programs within the same infrastructure.
