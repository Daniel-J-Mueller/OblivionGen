## Multi-Vehicle Swarm Beamforming with Predictive Handover

**Concept:** Extend directional antenna orientation beyond pairwise connections to enable a dynamically reconfigurable beamforming network across a swarm of vehicles (UAVs, ground vehicles, etc.). This allows for a collective, high-bandwidth link leveraging multiple vehicles as relay nodes and beamforming elements, rather than direct point-to-point communication.

**Specs:**

*   **Vehicle Node Components:**
    *   Directional Antenna (electronically steerable, high gain).
    *   Omnidirectional Antenna (low bandwidth, low power, for position/orientation broadcast).
    *   Processing Unit (high throughput, capable of real-time beamforming calculations).
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) + GPS (precise position/orientation tracking).
    *   Inter-Vehicle Communication Module (dedicated short-range, high-bandwidth link).
*   **Swarm Coordination Protocol:**
    *   **Distributed Beamforming Algorithm:** Each vehicle calculates its contribution to the overall beamform based on its position relative to the source and destination, and its estimated channel state information (CSI) from neighboring vehicles.
    *   **Predictive Handover:** Vehicles anticipate trajectory changes and proactively adjust beamforming weights to maintain connection with the swarm. This uses a Kalman filter or similar predictive tracking algorithm.
    *   **Dynamic Topology Management:** Algorithm to adjust the topology of the beamforming network as vehicles move, join, or leave the swarm. Prioritize vehicles with strong signal strength and minimal obstruction.
    *   **Latency Compensation:** Account for propagation delay and processing time in beamforming calculations to optimize data transmission.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  **Initialization:** Each vehicle broadcasts its position, orientation, and estimated CSI using the omnidirectional antenna.
    2.  **Topology Mapping:** A central coordinator (or distributed algorithm) creates a real-time map of the swarm's topology based on received broadcasts.
    3.  **Beamforming Calculation:** Each vehicle receives the topology map and calculates its beamforming weights based on its role in the network.
    4.  **Data Transmission:** Data is transmitted through the swarm using the directional antennas, with each vehicle acting as a relay node.
    5.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Vehicles continuously monitor signal strength and adjust beamforming weights to optimize performance.

**Pseudocode (Beamforming Weight Calculation - simplified):**

```
// Vehicle i calculates its beamforming weight for Vehicle j (destination)

// Inputs:
//  pos_i: Position of Vehicle i
//  pos_j: Position of Vehicle j
//  angle_i_to_j: Angle from Vehicle i to Vehicle j
//  channel_est_i_to_j: Estimated channel state information between i and j
//  latency_i_to_j: Estimated latency between i and j

// Calculate distance between vehicles
distance = calculate_distance(pos_i, pos_j);

// Calculate phase shift due to distance and latency
phase_shift = 2 * pi * (distance / wavelength) + (latency_i_to_j * frequency);

// Calculate signal attenuation based on channel estimate
attenuation = 1 / (channel_est_i_to_j + noise_floor);

// Calculate beamforming weight
weight = attenuation * exp(-1j * phase_shift);

// Normalize weight (optional)
weight = weight / calculate_total_weight();
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   High-bandwidth communication for swarm robotics.
*   Real-time video streaming from multiple drones.
*   Distributed sensor networks with high data throughput.
*   Emergency communication in disaster areas.
