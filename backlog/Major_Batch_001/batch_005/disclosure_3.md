## Dynamic Network "Shadowing" and Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Expand the idea of assessing network performance *after* changes by creating a dynamic "shadow" network that simultaneously implements changes in a controlled environment *before* live deployment. This isn't a full duplicate network, but a statistically representative subset, leveraging virtualization and traffic mirroring.

**Specs:**

*   **Shadow Network Creation:** A system component capable of dynamically provisioning a "shadow network" based on a configuration profile of the live network. This profile details critical devices (routers, switches, firewalls) and their interconnections. The shadow network will not be a 1:1 replication, but utilize weighted sampling of devices and connections to achieve statistically representative behavior.  Virtual machines or containerized network functions are preferred implementation details.
*   **Traffic Mirroring & Redirection:**  A mechanism to mirror a percentage of live network traffic to the shadow network.  This mirroring must preserve packet timing and ordering as much as possible. Additionally, a small percentage of *new* traffic can be *redirected* to the shadow network for real-world testing, subject to configurable safety thresholds.
*   **Change Deployment & Parallel Execution:** When a network change procedure is generated, it's deployed *concurrently* to both the live network *and* the shadow network. The shadow network executes the change with mirrored/redirected traffic, providing a real-time, isolated performance assessment.
*   **Predictive Performance Analysis:**  A machine learning module analyzes performance data from the shadow network *during* the change execution. This analysis predicts the impact of the change on key performance indicators (KPIs) *before* the change is fully committed in the live network. This uses time-series forecasting models to predict KPI trends based on shadow network data.
*   **Automated Rollback & Staged Deployment:** If the predictive analysis indicates a negative impact exceeding a defined threshold, the system automatically initiates a rollback of the change in the *live* network. Additionally, a 'staged deployment' option can be activated: deploying the change to a limited subset of live network devices first, monitoring performance, and then expanding the deployment if satisfactory.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Implement anomaly detection algorithms on both live and shadow network data. Significant deviations between the two networks (even if within acceptable thresholds) trigger alerts and further investigation.
*   **Historical Data & Trend Analysis:**  Maintain a comprehensive history of all network changes, performance data, and rollback events.  Use this data to identify recurring issues, optimize change procedures, and improve predictive accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Rollback Logic):**

```
function evaluate_change(shadow_network_data, KPI_thresholds):
  // Analyze shadow network data to determine KPI impact
  kpi_impact = calculate_kpi_impact(shadow_network_data)

  // Check if KPI impact exceeds thresholds
  if kpi_impact > KPI_thresholds:
    return "Negative Impact"
  else:
    return "Positive Impact"

function rollback_change():
  // Initiate rollback procedure on live network
  // (Details dependent on specific change procedure)
  log_event("Rollback initiated due to negative impact.")

// Main Change Execution Loop
generate_change_procedure()
deploy_change_procedure(live_network, shadow_network)

impact_assessment = evaluate_change(shadow_network_data, KPI_thresholds)

if impact_assessment == "Negative Impact":
    rollback_change()
else:
    commit_change_to_live_network()
```
