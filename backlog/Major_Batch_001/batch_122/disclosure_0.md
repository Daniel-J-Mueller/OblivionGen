## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Leveraging the existing audio analysis pipeline to build a real-time, geometrically-informed acoustic scene reconstruction for enhanced audio manipulation and augmented reality applications. The core idea expands on the similarity detection aspect of the patent to not just *verify* output, but to *map* the acoustic environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires a multi-microphone array on the first device (voice activated) with known spatial relationships. Additionally, the output device *must* have at least one microphone to function as an 'anchor'.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Mapping Engine:** A module responsible for building and maintaining a 3D map of the acoustic environment.
    *   **Ray Tracing Module:** Utilizes the acoustic map to simulate sound propagation and reflections.
    *   **Source Localization:** Refines and expands on the speech-to-text and similarity detection to pinpoint sound source origins in 3D space.
    *   **AR Integration Module:** Handles the overlay of acoustic data onto a visual AR environment.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `AcousticPoint`: A data structure representing a point in 3D space with associated acoustic properties (volume, frequency, reverberation).
    *   `AcousticMesh`: A collection of `AcousticPoint` objects forming a mesh representing surfaces in the acoustic environment.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Create AcousticMesh representing initial environment (empty)

// Main Loop
Receive Audio Data from First Device
Receive Audio Data from Output Device (anchor)

// 1. Source Localization
Locate sound sources in 3D space using triangulation based on arrival times from both devices.
Identify dominant sound sources (speech, music, etc.).

// 2. Acoustic Map Update
For each identified sound source:
    Calculate sound propagation path based on ray tracing.
    Update AcousticMesh based on reflected sound waves (add/modify AcousticPoints).
    Estimate surface materials based on sound reflections.

// 3. Similarity Analysis (Refined)
Compare captured audio from the first device against the 'expected' audio output from the output device.
If significant deviation detected:
    Analyze difference to identify potential issues (speaker malfunction, environmental interference).
    Adjust AcousticMesh to reflect observed discrepancies.

// 4. AR Integration (Optional)
Project AcousticMesh onto AR environment.
Visualize sound sources and propagation paths.
Allow user interaction with acoustic scene.
```

*   **Novelty:** This system isn’t simply confirming audio output, but *building a persistent model of the sonic environment*. The integration with AR creates a powerful new dimension for audio interaction and manipulation. It moves beyond passive detection into active reconstruction and visualization.
*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   **Smart Home Audio Control:** Adjust audio levels and equalization based on room acoustics and user location.
    *   **Immersive Gaming:** Create realistic soundscapes that adapt to the player’s movements and interactions.
    *   **Accessibility:** Provide visual cues for sound sources to assist individuals with hearing impairments.
    *   **Virtual/Augmented Reality Experiences:** Create more immersive and realistic audio-visual experiences.
    *   **Security Systems:** Acoustic anomaly detection and source localization for intrusion detection.
