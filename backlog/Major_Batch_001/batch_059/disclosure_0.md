## Dynamic Light Field Reconstruction with Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion

**Concept:** Expand beyond plenoptic cameras and mirrors to create a fully dynamic, high-resolution reconstruction of a scene using a network of diverse sensors. This system aims to overcome limitations of relying solely on light field data, particularly in challenging lighting conditions or with complex geometry.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Network:** Deploy a distributed network of sensors including:
    *   Plenoptic Cameras (as in the base patent) – Primary light field data capture.
    *   Time-of-Flight (ToF) Cameras – Depth information for scene geometry.
    *   Event Cameras – High-speed, low-latency capture of brightness changes, robust to motion blur and high dynamic range scenes.
    *   Thermal Cameras – Provide temperature data to identify objects or anomalies, particularly useful in obscured environments.
    *   Ambient Light Sensors - Measure overall light level and color temperature.
*   **Data Synchronization & Calibration:**
    *   High-precision time synchronization (e.g., using PTP) across all sensors.
    *   Extrinsic calibration routines to determine the precise spatial relationship between each sensor.
    *   Intrinsic calibration for each sensor type to correct for distortions and biases.
*   **Data Fusion Engine:**
    *   A central processing unit or distributed computing cluster to handle data ingestion and processing.
    *   A multi-stage fusion pipeline:
        1.  **Preprocessing:** Raw data is cleaned, calibrated, and transformed to a common coordinate system.
        2.  **Feature Extraction:** Key features are extracted from each sensor stream (e.g., light field rays, depth points, event edges, thermal gradients).
        3.  **Fusion & Reconstruction:** A learned fusion model (e.g., a neural radiance field – NeRF) integrates the features to reconstruct a high-resolution, dynamic 3D scene.
        4.  **Rendering & Display:**  A rendering engine generates novel views of the reconstructed scene from any viewpoint.

**Pseudocode - Fusion Model Training:**

```
// Input:  Raw sensor data (light field images, depth maps, event streams, thermal data)
// Output: Trained Fusion Model (NeRF)

function trainFusionModel(sensorData, trainingEpochs):

    for epoch in range(trainingEpochs):
        for batch in sensorData:

            // Extract features from each sensor modality
            lightFieldFeatures = extractLightFieldFeatures(batch.lightFieldImages)
            depthFeatures = extractDepthFeatures(batch.depthMaps)
            eventFeatures = extractEventFeatures(batch.eventStreams)
            thermalFeatures = extractThermalFeatures(batch.thermalData)

            // Concatenate features into a combined feature vector
            combinedFeatures = concatenate(lightFieldFeatures, depthFeatures, eventFeatures, thermalFeatures)

            // Pass combined features through NeRF network
            reconstructedImage = NeRFNetwork(combinedFeatures)

            // Calculate loss between reconstructed image and ground truth image
            loss = calculateLoss(reconstructedImage, batch.groundTruthImage)

            // Backpropagate loss and update NeRF network weights
            optimizer.step(loss)

    return NeRFNetwork
```

**Novel Applications:**

*   **Autonomous Navigation in Complex Environments:** Enables robust perception for robots and drones operating in cluttered or poorly lit spaces.
*   **Enhanced Security & Surveillance:** Provides detailed 3D reconstructions for security monitoring and forensic analysis.
*   **Interactive Virtual Reality:** Creates immersive VR experiences with high realism and dynamic content.
*   **Medical Imaging:** Enables advanced 3D visualization for surgical planning and diagnosis.
*   **Digital Twins:** Facilitates real-time monitoring and control of physical systems through accurate 3D models.
