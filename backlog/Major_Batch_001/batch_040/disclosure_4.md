## Dynamic Predictive Rendering with AI-Driven Content Decomposition

**Concept:** Extend the screenshot/image map preview approach by introducing AI-driven content decomposition *prior* to screenshot capture, and dynamically predict user focus areas for optimized progressive rendering. This moves beyond simply showing static screenshots to proactively preparing content likely to be interacted with.

**Specifications:**

**1. AI-Driven Content Decomposition Module (Server-Side):**

*   **Input:** Raw content page (HTML, CSS, Javascript, images).
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilize a trained AI model (e.g., a transformer network) to analyze the page structure and content.
    *   Identify key content blocks: headings, paragraphs, images, videos, forms, interactive elements.
    *   Assign a “focus probability” to each block based on historical user behavior, content type, and visual prominence. (Example: A large image with a clear call to action has a higher probability than a small, text-heavy paragraph.)
    *   Decompose the page into a hierarchical structure of content blocks.
    *   Generate optimized representations of each block for fast rendering (e.g., simplified SVG for vector graphics, low-resolution placeholder images).
*   **Output:** A content decomposition graph, optimized content blocks.

**2. Predictive Screenshot & Rendering Module (Server-Side):**

*   **Input:** Content decomposition graph, optimized content blocks.
*   **Process:**
    *   Generate an initial set of screenshots focusing on the highest-probability content blocks. Prioritize blocks likely to be visible in the initial viewport.
    *   Generate a sequence of ‘predicted screenshots’ for subsequent blocks, ordered by their predicted probability *and* proximity to the initial viewport (consider scrolling behavior prediction).
    *   Generate image maps linking to interactive elements within each screenshot.
    *   Create a ‘rendering queue’ of content blocks to be fully rendered on the server.
*   **Output:** Initial screenshots, predicted screenshots, rendering queue, image maps.

**3. Client-Side Rendering & Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Initial screenshots, predicted screenshots, rendering queue.
*   **Process:**
    *   Display the initial screenshots immediately.
    *   As the user interacts with the page (scrolling, mouse movement, clicks), monitor their focus.
    *   Prioritize rendering blocks from the rendering queue that align with the user's focus.
    *   Pre-fetch predicted screenshots for blocks likely to be visited next.
    *   Seamlessly replace placeholders with fully rendered content as it becomes available.
    *   **Dynamic Resolution Adjustment:** Adjust rendering resolution based on viewport size and user proximity, offering a "zoom" effect with finer detail only when necessary.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
onPageRequest(url):
    displayInitialScreenshots(getInitialScreenshots(url))
    renderingQueue = getRenderingQueue(url)

    onUserInteraction(event):
        userFocus = determineUserFocus(event)
        nextBlockToRender = prioritizeRenderingQueue(renderingQueue, userFocus)
        if nextBlockToRender:
            renderBlock(nextBlockToRender)
        prefetchNextScreenshots(userFocus)

function prioritizeRenderingQueue(queue, focus):
    // Sort queue by proximity to focus area and predicted probability
    // Return the highest priority block
    return prioritizedBlock

function prefetchNextScreenshots(focus):
    // Based on focus, predict likely next blocks
    // Fetch predicted screenshots and store for quick display
```

**4. Update Mechanism:**

*   The server continually monitors content changes and updates the decomposition graph.
*   The client periodically requests updates to the decomposition graph and predicted screenshots.

This approach moves beyond simply providing a static preview to dynamically preparing content tailored to the user’s likely interaction path. The AI-driven decomposition and prediction are key to optimizing the loading experience and minimizing perceived latency.
