## Dynamic VRF Assignment via Bluetooth Beaconing

**Concept:** Extend the VRF concept to transient network connections (e.g., mobile devices entering/exiting a network) using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beaconing for dynamic VRF assignment. This creates localized, secure network segments without manual configuration.

**Specifications:**

**1. Beacon Configuration & VRF Mapping:**

*   **Beacon Data Structure:** BLE beacons will transmit a payload containing:
    *   `Beacon ID`: Unique identifier for the beacon (e.g., MAC address).
    *   `VRF ID`:  Identifier for the VRF domain to be assigned.  A value of ‘0’ will denote a ‘guest’ VRF.
    *   `Security Key`:  An optional encryption key for secure communication within the VRF (AES-128).
*   **VRF Management Table:** The network element (router/switch) maintains a table mapping `Beacon ID` to `VRF ID` and `Security Key`. This table is dynamically updated via a central management system.  The table allows for override parameters; duration of VRF assignment, allowed bandwidth, maximum device count.

**2. Client Device Interaction:**

*   **Beacon Scanner:** Client devices (laptops, phones, IoT devices) continuously scan for BLE beacons.
*   **VRF Request:** Upon detecting a beacon, the client device transmits a VRF request to the network element, including the `Beacon ID` received.
*   **Authentication & Assignment:** The network element validates the `Beacon ID` against its VRF Management Table. If valid, the network element dynamically assigns the client device to the corresponding VRF domain.
*   **Dynamic MAC Address Allocation:** The network element allocates a unique MAC address within the assigned VRF to the client device. The client's original MAC address remains unchanged. The system uses Network Address Translation (NAT) to map between the client’s original and dynamic MAC.
*   **Security Enforcement:**  If a `Security Key` is provided in the beacon data, the network element establishes a secure tunnel (e.g., IPsec) with the client device using the key.

**3. Network Element Implementation:**

*   **BLE Receiver:** Integrated BLE receiver for detecting beacon signals.
*   **VRF Management Module:** Responsible for managing the VRF Management Table and dynamically assigning VRFs to clients.
*   **MAC Address Allocation Module:**  Manages the pool of dynamic MAC addresses and allocates them to clients.
*   **NAT Module:** Translates between the client’s original MAC address and the dynamic MAC address within the assigned VRF.
*   **Security Module:** Establishes and maintains secure tunnels with clients using the provided security key.
*   **VRF Routing Module:** Configures the network routing tables to route traffic within the assigned VRF domain.

**Pseudocode (Network Element - Receiving VRF Request):**

```
function handleVRFRequest(clientMAC, beaconID) {
  vrfInfo = lookupVRFInfo(beaconID);

  if (vrfInfo == null) {
    //Default to guest VRF
    vrfID = 0;
  } else {
    vrfID = vrfInfo.vrfID;
    securityKey = vrfInfo.securityKey;
  }

  dynamicMAC = allocateDynamicMAC(vrfID);

  if (dynamicMAC == null) {
    //Error: No dynamic MAC available
    return error;
  }

  createNATMapping(clientMAC, dynamicMAC, vrfID);

  if (securityKey != null) {
    establishSecureTunnel(clientMAC, securityKey);
  }

  updateVRFRoutingTable(dynamicMAC, vrfID);

  return success;
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Retail:** Dynamic VRF assignment for customers entering a store, providing localized network access and targeted advertising.
*   **Corporate:** Secure guest network access for visitors, isolating them from the corporate network.
*   **Smart Buildings:** Dynamic VRF assignment for IoT devices based on their location within the building.
*   **Event Spaces:** Segmenting network access for attendees at events.
