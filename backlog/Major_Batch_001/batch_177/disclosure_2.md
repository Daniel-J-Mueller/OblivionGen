## Adaptive Anomaly Contextualization via Generative Temporal Profiles

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This design proposes a system that enhances anomaly detection by creating and utilizing “Generative Temporal Profiles” (GTPs).  Instead of solely focusing on immediate deviations from a static or dynamically adjusted model, the system builds a contextual understanding of *expected* temporal variations within the data stream.  This is achieved using a generative model that learns the typical evolution of data patterns over time. Anomalies are then identified not just by deviation, but by improbable evolution *given* the learned temporal context.

**II. System Components:**

1.  **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:** Standard data ingestion pipeline. Features are scaled and normalized.

2.  **Temporal Pattern Extractor:** This component extracts short-term temporal patterns from the incoming data stream. Sliding windows of data are used, and patterns are represented as embeddings (e.g., using autoencoders or recurrent neural networks). These embeddings capture the sequential relationships within the window.

3.  **Generative Temporal Profile (GTP) Builder:** A generative model (e.g., Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), or Transformer) is trained on the embeddings generated by the Temporal Pattern Extractor. The GTP learns to generate realistic sequences of embeddings representing typical temporal evolution. The GTP is continuously updated with incoming data, allowing it to adapt to changing data patterns.

4.  **Anomaly Scoring Engine:**  For each incoming data window:
    *   The Temporal Pattern Extractor generates an embedding.
    *   The GTP attempts to reconstruct the embedding.
    *   The reconstruction error (e.g., mean squared error) is calculated.
    *   A “temporal divergence score” is calculated based on the reconstruction error, scaled by the GTP’s learned confidence in generating similar patterns. Lower confidence indicates a more significant deviation from expected temporal evolution.
    *   A conventional anomaly detection model (e.g., isolation forest, one-class SVM) is applied to the raw data features.
    *   A combined anomaly score is calculated by weighting the temporal divergence score and the conventional anomaly score.

5.  **Adaptive Weighting:** The weights assigned to the temporal divergence score and the conventional anomaly score are dynamically adjusted based on the characteristics of the data stream. For example, if the data stream is highly seasonal, the temporal divergence score should be given more weight.

**III. Pseudocode – Anomaly Scoring Engine:**

```pseudocode
function scoreAnomaly(dataWindow):
  embedding = TemporalPatternExtractor(dataWindow)
  reconstruction, confidence = GTP.reconstruct(embedding)
  temporalDivergence = calculateDivergence(embedding, reconstruction)
  temporalScore = temporalDivergence / confidence // Scale by confidence

  conventionalScore = ConventionalAnomalyDetector(dataWindow)

  // Adaptive Weighting (example)
  weightTemporal = calculateWeight(dataWindow) // Function to determine weight based on seasonality, trends, etc.
  weightConventional = 1 - weightTemporal

  combinedScore = (weightTemporal * temporalScore) + (weightConventional * conventionalScore)

  return combinedScore

function calculateWeight(dataWindow):
  // Implement logic to determine weight based on data characteristics
  // e.g., seasonality, trend strength, volatility
  // Could use Fourier analysis for seasonality detection
  // Or time series decomposition for trend analysis
  // Return a value between 0 and 1

```

**IV. Implementation Details:**

*   **GTP Model:** A Transformer-based architecture is preferred due to its ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data.
*   **Confidence Calculation:** The confidence score can be derived from the variance of the generated samples from the GTP or the likelihood of the observed embedding under the GTP.
*   **Adaptive Weighting:** Implement a separate machine learning model (e.g., a regression model) to predict the optimal weights for the temporal and conventional scores based on the characteristics of the data stream.  Features for this model could include seasonality, trend strength, volatility, and the output of the anomaly detection models.
*   **Data Visualization:** Provide a visualization interface that displays the temporal divergence score, the conventional anomaly score, the combined anomaly score, and the reconstructed embeddings. This will allow users to understand the reasoning behind the anomaly detection results.
