## Secure Enclosure - Dynamic Access Profiles & Predictive Lockdown

**Concept:** Expand the secure enclosure’s capabilities beyond simple power-state lockdown to incorporate dynamic access profiles tied to the *type* of data/computation occurring within the enclosure, and introduce a predictive lockdown feature anticipating data sensitivity increases.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Classification Engine (DCE):**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors data access patterns *within* the enclosure (not just power state). This requires network tap/mirroring capabilities within the rack.
*   **Implementation:** Software agent on each server. Agent analyzes file types, data transfer volumes, API calls, process names, and network traffic.
*   **Classification Levels:** Define 3+ levels (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Highly Confidential).  Levels assigned by pre-defined rules *and* manual override via a central management console.
*   **Output:**  DCE broadcasts a ‘Data Sensitivity Level’ to the Access Controller.

**2. Dynamic Access Control (DAC):**

*   **Integration:** DAC resides within the Access Controller.
*   **Rules Engine:** DAC maintains a matrix of Data Sensitivity Levels and corresponding Access Control profiles.
*   **Access Profiles:**
    *   *Physical Access*: Determines who (based on credential type & authorization) can physically access the enclosure.  (e.g., Confidential = only Tier 1 technicians).
    *   *Network Access*: Defines network segmentation/firewall rules for traffic originating from/destined for the enclosure.  (e.g., Highly Confidential = complete network isolation).
    *   *Remote Access*: Controls remote console/KVM access. (e.g., Confidential = multi-factor authentication required).
*   **Real-time Adjustment:** DAC dynamically adjusts these profiles based on the ‘Data Sensitivity Level’ received from the DCE.

**3. Predictive Lockdown System (PLS):**

*   **Trigger Conditions:** PLS monitors for specific events *indicating* an impending increase in data sensitivity.
    *   *Process Launch*: Launch of processes associated with data encryption, key generation, or sensitive data processing.
    *   *Data Transfer Volume Spike*:  Sudden, significant increase in outbound data transfer.
    *   *External API Calls*:  API calls to external services known to handle sensitive data (e.g., credit card processing).
*   **Lockdown Stages:**
    *   *Stage 1 (Alert):* Logs event, increases monitoring frequency, alerts security personnel.
    *   *Stage 2 (Pre-Lockdown):*  Initiates a countdown timer.  During this phase, data mirroring/replication to secure storage is prioritized.
    *   *Stage 3 (Lockdown):* Activates the physical lockdown mechanism *before* power-off.  Ensures all in-flight data is flushed to persistent storage. This stage is independent of power state.

**4. Pseudocode (PLS - Predictive Lockdown Sequence):**

```
function monitor_events() {
  while (true) {
    event = get_next_event();
    if (event.type == "process_launch" && event.process_name in sensitive_processes) {
      initiate_lockdown_sequence("process_launch");
    } else if (event.type == "data_transfer_spike" && event.volume > threshold) {
      initiate_lockdown_sequence("data_transfer_spike");
    } else if (event.type == "api_call" && event.api_url in sensitive_apis) {
      initiate_lockdown_sequence("api_call");
    }
  }
}

function initiate_lockdown_sequence(trigger_type) {
  log_event("Lockdown sequence initiated due to: " + trigger_type);
  start_timer(lockdown_delay); // Lockdown delay configurable
  prioritize_data_mirroring();
  if (timer_expired()) {
    activate_lockdown_mechanism();
  }
}

function activate_lockdown_mechanism() {
  send_signal_to_access_controller("lockdown");
  //Additional actions: Disable network ports, initiate secure wipe (if configured)
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Network Tap/Mirroring Device within each rack.
*   Increased processing power within Access Controller for DCE and PLS functions.
*   Potential for dedicated hardware security module (HSM) for key management.
