## Adaptive Predictive Buffering with Multi-Timescale Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the buffering concepts within the provided patent to incorporate predictive buffering based on multi-timescale analysis of incoming bitstreams. Instead of *reacting* to failures and adjusting buffer sizes *after* an error, proactively predict potential disruptions and adjust buffering *before* they occur. This leverages not just timing information, but also content-based analysis to anticipate issues.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Dedicated co-processor for timescale analysis (FPGA or specialized ASIC preferred). High-bandwidth, low-latency communication channels between co-processor, pipelines, and output buffer.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Timescale Analysis Engine:* This core module analyzes incoming bitstreams at multiple timescales – short-term (frame-to-frame), medium-term (group of frames/GOP), and long-term (entire stream characteristics).
    *   *Disruption Prediction Module:*  Utilizes the Timescale Analysis Engine output to predict potential disruptions. These predictions are weighted based on confidence levels.  Disruption types include: packet loss, network congestion, source instability, and content complexity spikes.
    *   *Adaptive Buffer Control:* Dynamically adjusts buffer sizes for *both* primary and redundant pipelines *before* disruptions occur, based on the Disruption Prediction Module’s output. It also considers the current output buffer fill level to prevent overflows or underflows.
    *   *Content Complexity Analyzer:* Analyzes the complexity of incoming video frames (motion vectors, scene changes, detail) to estimate decoding/processing load.  High complexity frames trigger proactive buffer pre-filling.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Buffer Control Module):**

```
function adjust_buffers(primary_pipeline, redundant_pipeline, output_buffer, disruption_prediction, complexity_analysis):

  // Get disruption prediction scores (0-1, higher = more likely disruption)
  disruption_score = disruption_prediction.get_score()

  // Get content complexity score (0-1, higher = more complex)
  complexity_score = complexity_analysis.get_score()

  // Base adjustment rate
  adjustment_rate = 0.01 // Percentage of buffer size to adjust per cycle

  // Modify adjustment rate based on prediction and complexity
  if disruption_score > 0.7:
    adjustment_rate *= 2 // Aggressive adjustment
  elif disruption_score > 0.3:
    adjustment_rate *= 1.5 // Moderate adjustment
  
  if complexity_score > 0.8:
    adjustment_rate += 0.005 // Add extra buffer for complex frames

  // Calculate buffer adjustments
  primary_adjustment = primary_pipeline.buffer_size * adjustment_rate
  redundant_adjustment = redundant_pipeline.buffer_size * adjustment_rate

  // Apply adjustments, but clamp to min/max buffer sizes
  primary_pipeline.buffer_size += primary_adjustment
  redundant_pipeline.buffer_size += redundant_adjustment

  // Ensure buffer sizes stay within safe limits
  primary_pipeline.buffer_size = clamp(primary_pipeline.buffer_size, MIN_BUFFER_SIZE, MAX_BUFFER_SIZE)
  redundant_pipeline.buffer_size = clamp(redundant_pipeline.buffer_size, MIN_BUFFER_SIZE, MAX_BUFFER_SIZE)

  //Output Buffer Adjustments
  output_buffer_adjustment = disruption_score * output_buffer.max_size * 0.05
  output_buffer.size += output_buffer_adjustment
  output_buffer.size = clamp(output_buffer.size, 0, output_buffer.max_size)

  return
```

**Novelty:**

This concept moves beyond reactive buffering to *proactive* buffering, using multi-timescale analysis and content understanding. The dynamic adjustment of both primary *and* redundant buffers, coupled with output buffer adjustments, provides a more robust and seamless failover experience, anticipating issues before they impact playback. The inclusion of content complexity analysis adds another layer of intelligence, fine-tuning buffer sizes based on processing load. It isn't about simply 'bigger' buffers, but 'smarter' buffers.
