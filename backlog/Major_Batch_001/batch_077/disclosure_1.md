## Dynamic Dependency Graph Orchestration

**Concept:** Expand the idea of tracking dependency states beyond simple data resources and code versions to a dynamically constructed and orchestrated dependency graph. This graph represents *all* dependencies – data, code, external services, infrastructure components – and their relationships, enabling proactive resource allocation and intelligent execution strategies.

**Specification:**

**1. Dependency Graph Construction Module:**

*   **Input:** Task definition (code, required resources, external service calls).
*   **Process:**
    *   Static analysis of task code to identify potential dependencies (files, libraries, network calls, etc.).
    *   Dynamic analysis (during a 'discovery' run) to resolve ambiguous dependencies and identify runtime-specific requirements. This 'discovery' run executes the code in a sandboxed environment, monitoring its behavior.
    *   Construction of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing dependencies. Nodes represent resources (data, code, services, infrastructure). Edges represent relationships (e.g., "code requires data", "service depends on infrastructure").
    *   Each node stores metadata: resource identifier, version/hash, current state (available, unavailable, loading, error), ownership (internal/external), cost (resource usage), priority.
*   **Output:** A Dependency Graph data structure.

**2. Resource Allocation & Provisioning Module:**

*   **Input:** Dependency Graph, execution request.
*   **Process:**
    *   Traverse the Dependency Graph to identify missing or outdated resources.
    *   Prioritize resource allocation based on node metadata (cost, priority).
    *   Dynamically provision resources:
        *   Internal resources: allocate from existing pools, trigger creation of new instances.
        *   External resources: request from external services, implement caching mechanisms.
    *   Manage resource lifecycles: allocate, release, scale.
*   **Output:** A fully provisioned execution environment.

**3. Execution Orchestration Module:**

*   **Input:** Provisioned execution environment, task definition.
*   **Process:**
    *   Execute the task within the provisioned environment.
    *   Monitor resource utilization and performance.
    *   Dynamically adjust resource allocation to optimize performance and cost.
    *   Capture execution state for auditing and debugging.
*   **Output:** Task execution results.

**4. State Capture & Propagation Module:**

*   **Input:** Execution results, updated resource states.
*   **Process:**
    *   Capture the final state of all resources used during the execution.
    *   Propagate state changes to the Dependency Graph.
    *   Update execution records with resource states.
*   **Output:** Updated Dependency Graph and execution records.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation):**

```
function allocateResources(dependencyGraph, executionRequest):
  missingResources = findMissingResources(dependencyGraph)
  
  while missingResources is not empty:
    resource = selectResourceToAllocate(missingResources) //Prioritize based on cost and priority
    
    if resource is internal:
      allocateFromPool(resource)
    else:
      requestFromExternalService(resource)
      
    missingResources.remove(resource)
    
  return provisionedExecutionEnvironment
```

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond simple state comparison to a proactive, dynamic orchestration of all task dependencies. It allows for intelligent resource allocation, proactive problem detection, and optimized execution strategies. This creates a far more robust and efficient on-demand execution system. It is adaptable to changing resource availability, and reduces the risks of execution failure.
