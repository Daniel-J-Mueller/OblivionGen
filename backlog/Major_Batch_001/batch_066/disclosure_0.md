## Adaptive Attestation Chains for Dynamic Trust Establishment

**Concept:** Extend the attestation process beyond static component verification to encompass dynamic, behavioral attestation. Instead of *just* verifying a component's version, establish a chain of attestation based on observed runtime behavior. This creates a 'trust score' reflecting not just *what* is running, but *how* it's running.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Sensor Suite:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate runtime data from various sources:
    *   CPU usage patterns (entropy, burstiness).
    *   Memory access patterns (read/write ratios, access locality).
    *   Network traffic characteristics (protocols, destination diversity).
    *   System call sequences (frequency, argument analysis).
    *   Peripheral device activity (sensors, cameras, microphones).
*   **Data Collection Agent:** A lightweight agent running on the client device, responsible for:
    *   Sampling runtime data.
    *   Feature extraction (applying statistical/ML techniques to create behavioral 'fingerprints').
    *   Secure transmission of feature vectors to a trust anchor.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** Implement differential privacy techniques to obfuscate individual user behavior while preserving aggregate trust signals.

**2. Trust Anchor & Attestation Chain:**

*   **Trust Anchor:** A central service (or distributed ledger) responsible for:
    *   Maintaining a baseline of 'normal' behavioral profiles for each application/component.
    *   Receiving behavioral feature vectors from client devices.
    *   Calculating a 'behavioral deviation score' based on comparison to the baseline.
    *   Issuing attestation extensions based on deviation scores.  (e.g., “Behavioral Attestation Level: High, Medium, Low”).
*   **Attestation Chain Construction:** The initial attestation (component version) is extended with behavioral attestations.
    *   `Initial Attestation: Component X, Version 1.2.3`
    *   `Extended Attestation: Component X, Version 1.2.3, Behavioral Attestation: High`
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** The trust anchor dynamically adjusts behavioral thresholds based on global threat intelligence and observed anomalies.

**3. Adaptive Access Control:**

*   **Policy Engine Integration:** The extended attestation is provided to the service provider’s policy engine.
*   **Granular Access Control:** Access is granted based on the combined strength of the component attestation *and* the behavioral attestation.
    *   High behavioral score + validated component = Full access.
    *   Low behavioral score + validated component = Limited access or multi-factor authentication required.
    *   Validated component + unusually volatile behavioral score = Access denied.

**Pseudocode (Client Device - Data Collection Agent):**

```
function collect_runtime_data():
  cpu_usage = get_cpu_usage()
  memory_access = get_memory_access_patterns()
  network_traffic = get_network_traffic_characteristics()

  features = extract_features(cpu_usage, memory_access, network_traffic)
  return features

function transmit_features(features):
  securely_transmit(features, trust_anchor_address)

loop:
  features = collect_runtime_data()
  transmit_features(features)
  sleep(5 seconds)
```

**Pseudocode (Trust Anchor - Attestation Extension):**

```
function calculate_deviation_score(received_features, baseline_features):
  # Apply statistical methods (e.g., anomaly detection algorithms)
  deviation = calculate_distance(received_features, baseline_features)
  return deviation

function issue_attestation_extension(deviation):
  if deviation < threshold_low:
    attestation_level = "High"
  elif deviation < threshold_medium:
    attestation_level = "Medium"
  else:
    attestation_level = "Low"
  return attestation_level

function process_client_data(client_features):
  deviation = calculate_deviation_score(client_features, baseline_features)
  attestation_level = issue_attestation_extension(deviation)
  return attestation_level
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond verifying *what* is running to verifying *how* it is running. This allows for detection of compromised software even if the component version is valid. The dynamic thresholds allow the system to adapt to evolving threats and provide a more robust security posture.
