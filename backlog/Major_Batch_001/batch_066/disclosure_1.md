## Dynamic UI Element 'Echoing' for Accessibility & Engagement

**Concept:** Extend the prominent UI element highlighting described in the patent to create a dynamic "echoing" effect. This isn't just about making the selected element brighter, but creating a visual 'ripple' or sequential highlight of related elements to aid discovery and accessibility.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Mechanism:** When a user selects a UI element (via remote control, touch, etc.), instead of *only* highlighting that element, a timed sequence of highlights emanates outwards to logically related elements.
*   **Relationship Graph:**  A data structure (JSON or similar) pre-defined within the content streaming device’s OS defines relationships between UI elements. This graph determines the sequence of highlighting.
    *   Example: If the selected element is a "Watch Now" button for a specific movie, the 'echo' sequence might highlight: the movie poster, the movie title, related genre tags, actor thumbnails, and then a 'more like this' recommendation section.
*   **Highlight Styles:** Customizable highlight styles beyond simple brightness/border. Options include:
    *   **Scale:** Briefly scale the element up/down.
    *   **Color Shift:** Subtly shift the element's color palette.
    *   **Animation:** Play a brief, contextual animation.
*   **Timing Control:** Adjustable timing parameters:
    *   `Echo Duration`:  Total time for the echo sequence.
    *   `Element Delay`: Time between highlighting each element in the sequence.
    *   `Highlight Persistence`:  How long each element remains highlighted.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to:
    *   Adjust the echo speed (faster/slower).
    *   Choose from preset echo styles.
    *   Disable the feature entirely.
*   **Accessibility Features:**
    *   Option for auditory feedback – a subtle 'ping' sound accompanies each highlight.
    *   High-contrast mode for the echo highlighting to aid visually impaired users.

**Pseudocode (Event Handler):**

```
function onUIElementSelected(elementID):
    // 1. Retrieve relationship graph for this element.
    relatedElements = getRelatedElements(elementID)

    // 2. Iterate through related elements, applying highlight.
    for each element in relatedElements:
        // 3. Apply highlight style to element.
        applyHighlight(element, style: chosenStyle)

        // 4. Wait for elementDelay.
        sleep(elementDelay)
```

**Implementation Considerations:**

*   The relationship graph needs to be dynamically loaded or pre-calculated based on the content being displayed.
*   Performance optimization is crucial to ensure smooth transitions without lag.
*   A robust testing framework is needed to verify the accuracy of the relationship graph and the responsiveness of the highlighting effect.
*   The UI element highlighting is extended to use 'sound echoing' to increase accessibility for all users. The sounds should be gentle and customizable.
*   The highlighting effects are also customizable for individual profiles and accounts.
