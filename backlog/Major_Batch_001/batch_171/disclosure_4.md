## Autonomous Workspace Reconfiguration & Predictive Pathing

**Concept:** Extend the intersection/collision avoidance system to dynamically reconfigure the workspace itself *around* mobile drive units to preemptively eliminate potential intersections, rather than reactively avoiding them. This leverages the system’s path prediction to proactively adjust physical barriers, floor markings, or even temporarily raised/lowered sections of the workspace floor.

**Specs:**

*   **Workspace Mapping Module:** High-resolution 3D mapping of the workspace, updated continuously via LiDAR, cameras, and/or ultrasonic sensors.  Data includes static obstacles (walls, fixed machinery) and dynamic elements (people, temporary storage).
*   **Predictive Path Analysis Engine:**  Algorithm that analyzes the current and predicted paths of *all* mobile drive units, projecting potential intersection points 5-10 seconds into the future.  This utilizes the core pathing/collision avoidance algorithms from the base patent.
*   **Reconfiguration Actuator Control System:** Interface with physical reconfiguration elements.  These elements may include:
    *   **Retractable Barriers:** Physical barriers (e.g., lightweight, modular walls) that can be raised/lowered.
    *   **Dynamic Markings:** Projected or illuminated floor markings that guide mobile drive units.  (Consider electroluminescent paint or micro-projectors.)
    *   **Variable-Height Flooring:** Sections of the floor that can be raised or lowered a few inches (e.g., pneumatic or hydraulic actuators). Limited range, focused on directing traffic.
    *   **Robotic Obstacles:** Small, mobile robots programmed to temporarily block off areas.
*   **Safety Override System:** Manual and automated overrides to prevent reconfiguration actions that might create new hazards. Prioritizes human safety above all else.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Secure, low-latency communication between mobile drive units, the mapping module, and the reconfiguration actuator control system.

**Pseudocode (Reconfiguration Logic):**

```
// Main Loop – Runs continuously

FOR EACH mobileDriveUnit IN mobileDriveUnitList:
    predictedPath = predictPath(mobileDriveUnit, predictionTime = 5 seconds)

    FOR EACH otherMobileDriveUnit IN mobileDriveUnitList:
        IF mobileDriveUnit != otherMobileDriveUnit:
            otherPredictedPath = predictPath(otherMobileDriveUnit, predictionTime = 5 seconds)
            intersectionPoint = findIntersection(predictedPath, otherPredictedPath)

            IF intersectionPoint != NULL:
                // Prioritize avoidance based on speed, load, and criticality
                avoidancePriority = calculateAvoidancePriority(mobileDriveUnit, otherMobileDriveUnit)

                IF avoidancePriority == mobileDriveUnit:
                    // Reconfigure workspace to divert otherMobileDriveUnit
                    reconfigurationAction = determineReconfigurationAction(intersectionPoint, otherMobileDriveUnit)
                    executeReconfigurationAction(reconfigurationAction)
                ELSE:
                    // Mobile Drive Unit should yield
                    adjustVelocity(mobileDriveUnit, intersectionPoint)
```

**Detailed Specifications:**

*   **Mapping Resolution:** Minimum 1cm resolution for static obstacles, 5cm for dynamic.
*   **Reconfiguration Speed:** Barrier deployment/retraction within 2 seconds.  Floor height adjustment within 1 second.
*   **Communication Latency:**  < 100ms.
*   **Power Supply:** Redundant power systems for critical components.
*   **Fail-Safe Mechanisms:**  Emergency stop buttons, automated shutdown sequences.

**Novelty:** The existing patent focuses on reactive collision avoidance. This adaptation focuses on *preventative* collision avoidance via dynamic workspace reconfiguration, turning the workspace itself into an active participant in traffic management.
