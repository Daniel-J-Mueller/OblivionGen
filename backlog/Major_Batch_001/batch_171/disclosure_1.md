## Dynamic Surface Treatment via Acoustic Levitation & Microfluidics

**Concept:** Combining acoustic levitation of liquid droplets with localized surface treatment to create patterned surface energies with sub-micron resolution. This leverages the precision of acoustic trapping and the ability to control droplet composition/treatment within the levitated volume.

**Specs:**

*   **Acoustic Levitation System:**
    *   Frequency: 40kHz – 1MHz (tunable).
    *   Transducer Array: 2D phased array for precise 3D positioning and droplet shaping. Minimum 1024 elements.
    *   Levitation Chamber: Enclosed, environmentally controlled chamber (temperature, humidity, gas composition).
    *   Droplet Size Control:  Capable of levitating droplets from 10um to 500um diameter.
*   **Microfluidic Integration:**
    *   Droplet Generation:  Microfluidic chip integrated beneath the levitation chamber for continuous droplet generation.  Flow rates programmable from nL/min to µL/min per channel. Multiple channels for multi-component droplet creation.
    *   Droplet Composition Control:  Reservoirs for a variety of treatment precursors (e.g., silanes, polymers, acids, bases) connected to the microfluidic chip.  Precise mixing ratios controlled via software.
*   **Localized Surface Treatment System:**
    *   Treatment Source:  Plasma jet or UV-ozone source positioned above the levitation chamber.  Focusable beam diameter < 10um.
    *   Synchronization:  Treatment source synchronized with droplet position and movement. Programmable dwell time and intensity.
    *   Surface Stage: High-precision XYZ stage for sample positioning and scanning. Resolution < 1um.
*   **Control Software:**
    *   Droplet Trajectory Planning: Software for defining complex 3D droplet trajectories.
    *   Treatment Parameter Control:  Software interface for setting treatment parameters (intensity, dwell time, precursor composition).
    *   Feedback System:  Optical microscopy integrated with the system for real-time monitoring of droplet shape, position, and treatment effects. Feedback loop for automatic trajectory correction and parameter optimization.
*   **Materials:**
    *   Substrates: Compatible with a wide range of materials (e.g., silicon, glass, polymers, metals).
    *   Precursors:  Selection of precursors for surface modification (e.g., silanes, polymers, acids, bases).

**Operation:**

1.  A liquid droplet containing the desired surface treatment precursor is generated by the microfluidic chip and levitated within the acoustic levitation chamber.
2.  The droplet is positioned above the target substrate using the phased array transducers.
3.  The localized surface treatment source (plasma jet or UV-ozone) is activated, and the substrate is exposed to the precursor via the levitated droplet.
4.  The droplet is moved across the substrate surface according to a pre-defined trajectory.
5.  The treatment parameters (intensity, dwell time, precursor composition) are dynamically adjusted based on real-time feedback from the optical microscopy.
6.  This process is repeated to create patterned surface energies with sub-micron resolution.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Microfluidic device fabrication
*   Lab-on-a-chip devices
*   Biomarker detection
*   Cell patterning
*   Micro-robotics
*   Advanced materials fabrication.
