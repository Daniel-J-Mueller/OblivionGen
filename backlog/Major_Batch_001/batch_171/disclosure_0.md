## Autonomous Swarm Predictive Maintenance - Multi-UAV Collaboration

**Concept:** Extend the single-UAV prognostics system to a collaborative swarm model, enabling predictive maintenance across a fleet of UAVs, leveraging data from all units to improve individual predictions and optimize overall mission success. This builds on the existing sensor data and predictive modeling, adding inter-UAV communication and a centralized (or distributed) data fusion layer.

**Specs:**

*   **UAV Hardware:**
    *   Each UAV equipped with existing sensor suite as defined in the patent.
    *   Dedicated short-range, secure communication module (e.g., 802.11ad, UWB) for inter-UAV communication. Range: 500m minimum. Data Rate: 10 Mbps minimum.
    *   Increased onboard processing capability to handle communication overhead and distributed processing.
    *   Standardized data communication protocol (defined below).

*   **Data Communication Protocol:**
    *   **Message Type:** Sensor Data Update, Predictive Model Update, Status Report, Request for Assistance.
    *   **Data Payload:** Compressed sensor data, model parameters (delta updates preferred), UAV health status, assistance request details (subsystem, severity).
    *   **Addressing:** Unique UAV ID for directed communication, broadcast address for general status updates.
    *   **Security:** AES-256 encryption for all communications.

*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Local Prognostics Module:**  Enhanced version of the existing module, capable of receiving and integrating data from other UAVs.
    *   **Swarm Manager:** Distributed across the fleet. Responsible for:
        *   Maintaining a real-time map of the swarm topology.
        *   Facilitating data sharing and synchronization.
        *   Aggregating and fusing predictive model outputs.
        *   Allocating resources (e.g., adjusting mission parameters) based on collective health assessment.
    *   **Data Fusion Algorithm:** Bayesian Network or Kalman Filter-based approach to combine sensor data and predictive model outputs from multiple UAVs. Account for sensor noise, communication delays, and UAV-specific operating conditions.
    *   **Adaptive Model Training:**  The swarm collectively refines predictive models. When a UAV experiences a failure, the data is shared with the swarm, enabling all UAVs to update their models.
    *   **Failure Propagation Prediction:** Analyze historical failure data to model how failures in one subsystem might cascade to others, potentially affecting multiple UAVs.

*   **Operational Procedure:**
    1.  **Initialization:**  UAVs establish a communication network upon deployment.
    2.  **Data Sharing:**  Each UAV periodically broadcasts its sensor data and predictive model outputs.
    3.  **Data Fusion:** The swarm manager aggregates and fuses the received data.
    4.  **Predictive Maintenance:** The swarm manager identifies potential failures and triggers corrective actions.
    5.  **Adaptive Learning:** The swarm updates its predictive models based on observed failures and performance data.
    6.  **Assistance Request:** If a UAV detects a critical failure, it broadcasts an assistance request. Neighboring UAVs can provide support (e.g., temporarily share resources, provide guidance, or assume the failing UAV's tasks).

**Pseudocode (Swarm Manager - Data Fusion):**

```
function fuseData(sensorDataList, modelOutputList):
  // sensorDataList: List of sensor data from all UAVs
  // modelOutputList: List of predictive model outputs from all UAVs

  fusedSensorData = average(sensorDataList)  // Simple average, can be weighted
  fusedModelOutput = combineModelOutputs(modelOutputList)

  //combineModelOutputs:
  //  1. Apply Bayesian Network or Kalman Filter to combine model outputs.
  //  2. Account for confidence intervals and data uncertainty.
  //  3. Output: Combined predictive model with improved accuracy.

  return fusedModelOutput
```

**Novelty:** This extends single-UAV prognostics to a swarm-level system, enabling proactive maintenance across a fleet, improved prediction accuracy, and enhanced mission resilience through collaborative assistance. The distributed nature of the system and the ability to learn from collective data represent a significant advancement.
