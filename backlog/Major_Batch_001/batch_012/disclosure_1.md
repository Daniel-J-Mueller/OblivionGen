## Dynamic Exposure Bracketing with Predictive Stitching

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-camera array (minimum 3 cameras, expandable), processing unit with GPU acceleration, high-bandwidth communication bus between cameras and processing unit.
*   **Software:** Real-time image processing pipeline, machine learning model for scene understanding and exposure prediction, stitching algorithm optimized for variable exposure images, user interface for system control and monitoring.

**Innovation Description:**

This system moves beyond static exposure settings and *predictively* brackets exposures across a multi-camera array *before* capturing images, specifically for optimized stitching. It’s not just about merging differently exposed images *after* capture, but *anticipating* exposure needs based on scene content *during* capture.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Scene Analysis Module:** Uses a lightweight CNN running on the processing unit to analyze the live video feed from all cameras. This module identifies key scene elements (bright highlights, dark shadows, texture density, depth estimation from stereo vision).  The output is a ‘dynamic range map’ – a per-pixel indication of the required exposure range.

2.  **Predictive Exposure Controller:**  This module receives the dynamic range map and uses a trained machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network) to *predict* the optimal exposure settings for each camera, *before* the image is captured. The model is trained on a large dataset of scenes and corresponding optimal exposure settings, with specific emphasis on reducing stitching artifacts. It considers not just the absolute exposure values, but also the *differences* in exposure between cameras, aiming for minimal variation while maximizing dynamic range. It aims to minimize the *gradients* of exposure across potential stitching seams.

3.  **Asynchronous Capture & Pre-Processing:** Cameras capture images asynchronously, triggered by the Predictive Exposure Controller. Each camera’s image undergoes initial pre-processing (noise reduction, distortion correction) in parallel.

4.  **Stitching Module with Adaptive Gain Mapping:** The core stitching algorithm utilizes a robust feature-matching technique (e.g., SIFT or ORB).  However, *before* blending, it applies an adaptive gain mapping based on the predicted exposure differences. The original patent’s spatially-varying gains are refined by incorporating edge-aware smoothing to minimize visible seams. This smoothing is weighted by the confidence score from the scene analysis module – higher confidence means more aggressive smoothing.

5.  **Real-Time Feedback Loop:**  The system analyzes the stitched image and assesses the quality of the result (e.g., sharpness, seam visibility, dynamic range). This feedback is used to refine the machine learning model in the Predictive Exposure Controller, creating a continuous learning loop.

**Pseudocode (Simplified - Predictive Exposure Controller):**

```
// Input: Live video feed from each camera
// Output: Exposure settings for each camera

function predictExposure(cameraID, dynamicRangeMap) {
  // 1. Feature extraction from dynamicRangeMap (CNN)
  features = extractFeatures(dynamicRangeMap)

  // 2. Predict optimal exposure settings using trained RNN model
  exposureSettings = RNN_Model.predict(features)

  // 3. Apply constraints (minimum/maximum exposure, step size)
  constrainedExposure = constrain(exposureSettings)

  return constrainedExposure
}

function optimizeStitching(camera1Exposure, camera2Exposure, seamRegion) {
  //Calculate exposure diff
  exposureDiff = abs(camera1Exposure - camera2Exposure);
  //Calculate gain ratio based on exposure diff
  gainRatio = calculateGain(exposureDiff);

  //Apply gainRatio to seamRegion pixels
  adjustSeamPixels(seamRegion, gainRatio);
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Light Field Capture Integration:**  Combine with light field capture to enable view synthesis and refocusing after stitching.
*   **Temporal Consistency:**  Track scene features over time to improve stitching accuracy and reduce flickering in video sequences.
*   **AI-Powered Seam Editing:**  Use AI to automatically detect and remove any remaining visible seams or artifacts in the stitched image.
