## Dynamic Refraction Mapping for Enhanced Situational Awareness

**Concept:** Expand the FOV extender concept beyond simple light redirection for wider coverage. Instead, utilize dynamically adjustable prism arrays to *map* the external environment onto the image sensor, creating a pseudo-3D representation.

**Specs:**

*   **Prism Array:** Replace the static prism arrangement with an array of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) controlled, individually addressable liquid crystal prisms. Each prism functions as a steerable light deflector.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Integrate a low-resolution depth sensor (e.g., time-of-flight) to capture rudimentary depth information of the scene. This isn’t for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction, but to inform the prism steering logic.
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded system (FPGA or low-power SoC) to process depth data and calculate optimal prism deflection angles.
*   **Mapping Algorithm:**
    1.  Depth data is segmented into regions of interest (e.g., objects, ground plane, sky).
    2.  For each region, calculate a ‘mapping vector’ based on distance and desired projection point on the image sensor. The goal is to “flatten” the 3D scene onto the 2D sensor, prioritizing key areas.
    3.  Control each liquid crystal prism to deflect incoming light based on its corresponding mapping vector.
    4.  Implement a feedback loop – analyze the resulting image and refine mapping vectors for improved clarity and reduced distortion.
*   **Image Stitching:** Software to intelligently stitch together the redirected image data from the prisms with the standard lens image, creating a seamless, widened field of view. Implement edge blending algorithms for smooth transitions.
*   **Calibration:** Automated calibration procedure to account for prism imperfections and sensor variations.
*   **Power:** Low-power operation via efficient MEMS control and optimized processing algorithms.
*   **Physical Dimensions:** Design the prism array to integrate seamlessly with existing camera housings, minimizing added bulk.

**Pseudocode (Prism Control Loop):**

```
FOR each prism IN prism_array:
    depth_data = get_depth_data(prism.location)
    mapping_vector = calculate_mapping_vector(depth_data, desired_projection_point)
    prism.set_deflection_angle(mapping_vector.x, mapping_vector.y)
END FOR

// Image processing and stitching routine
processed_image = stitch_images(standard_image, prism_images)

display(processed_image)
```

**Innovation:**  This moves beyond simple FOV extension to actively *shape* the captured image, providing a form of dynamic perspective control. It allows the camera to ‘look around corners’ or emphasize specific areas of interest. Potential applications include enhanced surveillance, autonomous navigation, and immersive virtual/augmented reality.  The ability to adapt the perspective dynamically makes it more than just a wide-angle lens – it’s a smart imaging system.
