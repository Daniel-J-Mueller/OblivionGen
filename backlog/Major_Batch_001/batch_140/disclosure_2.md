## Dynamic API View Composition via User-Defined Transformations

**Specification:** A system enabling end-users (non-developers) to compose API views with on-the-fly data transformations using a visual, node-based editor.

**Core Concept:** Expand on the existing API view definition capability by allowing users to define transformation logic *within* the view definition itself, applied to data retrieved from underlying web services. This moves beyond simple data selection and formatting to true data manipulation.

**Components:**

1.  **Visual Editor:** A web-based, drag-and-drop interface.
    *   **Nodes:** Represent data sources (web services), transformations (e.g., filtering, mapping, calculations, string manipulation), and output fields.
    *   **Connections:** Define data flow between nodes.
    *   **Transformation Library:** A library of pre-built transformations (expandable).  Includes functions for common operations (e.g., date formatting, unit conversion, regular expression matching).
    *   **Expression Builder:** Allows users to define custom transformations using a simple scripting language (e.g., a subset of JavaScript or Python) or a visual expression builder.

2.  **View Definition Storage:** The view definition now includes not only the web service references and data field mapping but also the entire transformation graph (serialized as JSON or similar).

3.  **Execution Engine:** A component responsible for executing the transformation graph.
    *   Receives data from the web services.
    *   Processes the data through the transformation nodes.
    *   Formats the output according to the view definition.

**Workflow:**

1.  The user creates a new view definition in the visual editor.
2.  The user drags and drops web service nodes to specify data sources.
3.  The user adds transformation nodes to manipulate the data.  Example transformations:
    *   Filter records based on a condition (e.g., "status = 'active'").
    *   Map fields from different web services.
    *   Calculate new fields (e.g., "total_cost = price * quantity").
    *   Format dates or numbers.
    *   Concatenate strings.
4.  The user connects the nodes to define the data flow.
5.  The user specifies the output fields and their format.
6.  The view definition is saved.
7.  When a request for the view is received:
    *   The view service retrieves the view definition.
    *   The execution engine retrieves data from the web services.
    *   The execution engine processes the data through the transformation graph.
    *   The execution engine formats the output according to the view definition.
    *   The response object is returned.

**Pseudocode (Execution Engine):**

```
function executeView(viewDefinition, requestData):
    graph = viewDefinition.transformationGraph
    dataSources = viewDefinition.dataSources
    outputFields = viewDefinition.outputFields

    // Retrieve data from data sources
    rawData = {}
    for dataSource in dataSources:
        rawData[dataSource.name] = callWebService(dataSource)

    // Traverse the transformation graph
    transformedData = traverseGraph(graph, rawData)

    // Extract output fields
    output = {}
    for field in outputFields:
        output[field.name] = transformedData[field.source]

    return output
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Version Control:** Allow users to version their view definitions.
*   **Collaboration:** Enable multiple users to collaborate on view definitions.
*   **Sharing:** Allow users to share view definitions with others.
*   **Real-Time Updates:**  Enable view updates in near real-time as underlying data changes.
*   **AI-Assisted Transformation:**  Suggest transformations based on the data and the desired output.
