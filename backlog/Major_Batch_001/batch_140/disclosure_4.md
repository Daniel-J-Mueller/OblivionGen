## Adaptive Resource Prefetching Based on Predicted User Interaction

**Concept:** Extend the consolidation/grouping idea to *proactively* prefetch resource sets based on predicted user interaction, anticipating needs *before* a request is even made. This isn’t about optimizing existing requests, but about anticipating future ones.

**Specifications:**

**1. Interaction Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** User interaction data (mouse movements, scrolling, click patterns, dwell time on elements, keyboard input), contextual data (time of day, location, device type), content metadata (article topic, embedded media type, page layout).
*   **Process:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on historical user interaction data. The LSTM will predict the *next* likely resource request based on the current user interaction sequence.  The prediction is expressed as a probability distribution over possible resource sets (defined as consolidated groups from the original patent).
*   **Output:** Ranked list of predicted resource sets, with associated confidence scores.  For example: `[ResourceSet_A (0.85), ResourceSet_B (0.10), ResourceSet_C (0.05)]`.

**2. Prefetching Engine:**

*   **Input:** Ranked list of predicted resource sets (from Interaction Prediction Module), current network bandwidth, device capabilities (screen size, processing power), prefetch cache status.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Bandwidth & Device Awareness:**  Dynamically adjust the number of prefetched resource sets based on available bandwidth and device limitations.
    *   **Cache Prioritization:** Prioritize prefetching resource sets that are *not* already in the cache.
    *   **Prefetch Initiation:** Initiate asynchronous requests for the top-ranked resource sets.
*   **Output:**  Prefetched resources stored in a client-side cache (e.g., browser cache, service worker cache).

**3. Resource Delivery Mechanism:**

*   **Integration with Existing System:**  When a client requests a resource, the system first checks the prefetch cache. If the resource is present, it is served immediately.
*   **Fallback Mechanism:** If the resource is *not* in the cache, the system falls back to the traditional resource loading process.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Engine):**

```
function prefetchResources(predictedResourceSets, availableBandwidth, deviceCapabilities, cacheStatus):
  resourcesToPrefetch = []
  bandwidthAllocation = calculateBandwidthAllocation(availableBandwidth, deviceCapabilities)

  for resourceSet in predictedResourceSets:
    if isResourceSetInCache(resourceSet, cacheStatus):
      continue  # Skip if already cached

    prefetchCost = calculatePrefetchCost(resourceSet, bandwidthAllocation)

    if prefetchCost <= availableBandwidth:
      resourcesToPrefetch.append(resourceSet)
      availableBandwidth -= prefetchCost

  # Initiate asynchronous requests for resourcesToPrefetch
  for resourceSet in resourcesToPrefetch:
    initiateAsynchronousRequest(resourceSet)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **ResourceSet:**  A container representing a group of consolidated embedded resources (as defined in the original patent).  Includes metadata (e.g., size, content type, dependencies).
*   **CacheEntry:**  Stores a ResourceSet in the cache, along with its last access time and expiration date.

**Novelty:** This isn't simply about making existing resource loading more efficient. It's about *predicting* what the user will need *before* they need it, and proactively preparing for that need. This introduces a layer of predictive caching that is independent of the current user request.  The LSTM-based prediction model is key to adapting to individual user behavior and content context.
