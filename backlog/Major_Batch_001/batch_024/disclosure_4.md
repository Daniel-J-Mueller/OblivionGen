**Adaptive Environmental Storytelling via Biofeedback-Driven Projection Mapping**

**System Specs:**

*   **Data Acquisition:** Multi-sensor array – EEG (electroencephalography) headset, Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor, heart rate monitor. Data sampled at minimum 30Hz.
*   **Processing Unit:** Edge computing device (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano) for real-time data processing and feature extraction.
*   **Feature Extraction:** Algorithms to identify emotional states (valence, arousal, dominance) from biofeedback data. Machine learning models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forests) trained on labelled biofeedback datasets.
*   **Projection Mapping System:** High-resolution projector capable of dynamic keystone correction and blending.  Coverage area customizable via software. Utilize a Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor to map the environment in 3D, enabling accurate projection onto non-planar surfaces.
*   **Content Engine:**  Procedurally generated visual and auditory content library linked to emotional states. Content includes abstract visual patterns, nature scenes, ambient soundscapes, and subtle haptic feedback (via integrated vibrotactile actuators).
*   **Software API:**  Software Development Kit (SDK) allowing developers to create custom content and integrate with other applications.

**Operational Description:**

The system creates an immersive, emotionally responsive environment.  A user wears the biofeedback sensors. The edge computing device analyzes their emotional state in real-time.  Based on the detected emotion, the content engine selects and projects relevant visuals and sound onto the surrounding environment. The projection mapping system dynamically adapts the content to the shape of the room and objects within it.

**Pseudocode – Core Loop:**

```
LOOP:
    READ biofeedback data (EEG, GSR, Heart Rate)
    ANALYZE biofeedback data --> EMOTIONAL_STATE (Valence, Arousal, Dominance)
    LOOKUP content in CONTENT_LIBRARY based on EMOTIONAL_STATE
    GENERATE projection mapping parameters (keystone, blending, color, intensity)
    PROJECT content onto environment using projection mapping system
    ADJUST content and projection parameters based on real-time biofeedback
    REPEAT
```

**Content Example:**

*   **High Arousal, Positive Valence:** Energetic visual patterns (flowing lines, bright colors), upbeat ambient music, gentle vibration.
*   **Low Arousal, Negative Valence:**  Calming nature scenes (forest, ocean), slow, melancholic music, subtle dimming of lights.
*   **Neutral State:**  Abstract geometric patterns, ambient soundscapes, neutral lighting.

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond passive emotional recognition to actively shape the environment in response to user emotions, creating a feedback loop that enhances emotional experience.  The integration of biofeedback with dynamic projection mapping and procedural content generation provides a level of environmental responsiveness not currently available.
