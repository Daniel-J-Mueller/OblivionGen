## Dynamic Symbol Injection via Federated Learning

**Concept:** Extend the symbol table functionality by allowing symbols and their values to be learned and updated *across* multiple service provider environments (different instances, providers, or even user-specific environments) using federated learning. This creates a continuously improving, globally aware symbol table without centralizing data.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component 1: Federated Symbol Table (FST) Agent:** Each service provider environment runs an FST agent. This agent manages a local symbol table and participates in federated learning rounds.
*   **Component 2: Global Aggregator:** A central (but non-data holding) aggregator coordinates federated learning. It receives model updates (symbol/value mappings) from FST agents and averages them to create a new global model.
*   **Component 3: Symbol Request Interceptor:** Within the interpreter, a component intercepts symbol requests. It first checks the local symbol table. If not found, it initiates a request to the FST agent.
*   **Component 4: Value Propagation Mechanism:** Mechanism for rapidly distributing updated symbol/value pairs from the global model to all FST agents. A bloom filter based approach for efficient dissemination.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initial State:** Each FST agent starts with a minimal, predefined symbol table.
2.  **Symbol Request:** Interpreter requests a symbol. Local check fails.
3.  **Federated Request:** FST agent checks if the symbol exists in the *current* global model. If not, it generates a temporary value (e.g., a placeholder) and begins a request for a learned value.
4.  **Learning Round:**
    *   The FST agent collects usage data (frequency of symbol access, context of symbol use) within its environment.
    *   It trains a local model to predict an appropriate value for the missing symbol based on the collected data.
    *   The local model update (changes to symbol/value mapping) is sent to the Global Aggregator.
    *   The Global Aggregator averages updates from all participating FST agents.
    *   The aggregated update is broadcast to all FST agents.
    *   Each FST agent updates its local model (and symbol table).
5.  **Value Provision:** The updated symbol/value mapping is returned to the interpreter.
6.  **Continuous Learning:** Steps 4-5 repeat continuously, adapting the symbol table to evolving usage patterns.

**Pseudocode (FST Agent â€“ Simplified):**

```
function handleSymbolRequest(symbol):
  if symbol in localSymbolTable:
    return localSymbolTable[symbol]

  # Initiate Federated Learning Request
  requestLearningRound(symbol)

  # Return Placeholder Value (temporary)
  return "PLACEHOLDER"

function requestLearningRound(symbol):
  collectUsageData(symbol)
  trainLocalModel(symbol)
  sendModelUpdateToAggregator()
  receiveGlobalModelUpdate()
  updateLocalSymbolTable()
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Local Symbol Table:**  `Dictionary<Symbol, Value>`
*   **Usage Data:** `List<Tuple<Context, Symbol, Frequency>>` (Context can be code snippet, function call, etc.)
*   **Model Update:**  `List<Tuple<Symbol, ValueUpdate>>` (ValueUpdate could be a delta or a complete new value)



**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Accuracy:** Symbol values learned from diverse environments are likely more accurate and robust.
*   **Automatic Adaptation:** The symbol table adapts automatically to changing application needs and usage patterns.
*   **Reduced Latency:** Frequently used symbols will be available locally, reducing the need for external lookups.
*   **Privacy:** Federated learning ensures data remains distributed, protecting user privacy.
*   **Scalability:** The distributed nature of the system allows it to scale to a large number of service provider environments.
