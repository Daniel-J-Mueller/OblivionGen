## Adaptive Acoustic Zones

**Concept:** Create a system where the voice-controlled device dynamically establishes and adjusts “acoustic zones” based on signal strength from the external signaling device, and potentially, other networked devices. This goes beyond simple proximity detection.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Voice-controlled device with multi-microphone array (minimum 4 microphones).
    *   External signaling device (button, app, etc.) with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beaconing capability.  Beacon signal includes signal strength (RSSI) and a unique device ID.
    *   Optionally:  Integration with existing smart home ecosystem (e.g., WiFi-based location services for other devices).
*   **Software:**
    *   **Zone Mapping Module:**  Upon receiving a signal from the external device, the device initiates a “listening sweep.” The microphone array captures audio, and signal processing algorithms (beamforming, sound source localization) determine the relative direction and distance of the signaling device. This creates a preliminary acoustic zone centered on the device.
    *   **Dynamic Zone Adjustment:**  The zone isn’t static.  The system continuously monitors the RSSI of the BLE beacon. Decreasing signal strength indicates the user is moving away, causing the acoustic zone to *expand* and become more sensitive to ambient noise. Increasing signal strength causes the zone to *contract* and focus more narrowly on the user’s location.  
    *   **Multi-User/Device Support:**  If multiple signaling devices are present, the system creates overlapping zones. Algorithms prioritize the zone with the strongest signal or allow the user to select a preferred device.
    *   **Ambient Noise Cancellation (Adaptive):**  Based on the size of the acoustic zone, the system dynamically adjusts noise cancellation algorithms. Smaller zones allow for aggressive noise cancellation, while larger zones use more subtle filtering to avoid cutting off legitimate voice commands.
    *   **Directional Audio Feedback:**  The device can output directional audio cues (e.g., a subtle chime) to indicate that it has successfully identified the user’s location and is ready to receive a voice command.

**Pseudocode (Zone Mapping Module):**

```
function map_acoustic_zone(signal_data):
  device_id = signal_data.device_id
  rssi = signal_data.rssi

  // Initiate microphone array scan
  audio_data = capture_audio()

  // Apply beamforming/sound source localization algorithms
  location_data = analyze_audio(audio_data)

  // Calculate zone boundaries based on location_data and rssi
  zone_center = location_data.center
  zone_radius = calculate_radius(rssi)  // RSSI maps to radius

  // Create zone object
  zone = {
    id: device_id,
    center: zone_center,
    radius: zone_radius
  }

  return zone
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   Explore the use of machine learning to predict user movement and proactively adjust the acoustic zone.
*   Implement gesture recognition using the microphone array to allow users to “point” towards desired objects or locations within the zone.
*   Integrate with other sensors (e.g., cameras) to provide visual feedback and enhance zone mapping accuracy.
