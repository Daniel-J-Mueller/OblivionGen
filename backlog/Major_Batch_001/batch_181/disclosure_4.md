## Dynamic Environmental Audio-Visual Sculpting

**Concept:** Extend the voice-command/device-handoff paradigm into a spatially aware, dynamic audio-visual ‘sculpting’ system. Instead of simply directing content *to* a secondary display, leverage multiple nearby devices (speakers, displays, lights) to create immersive, contextualized experiences that react to both the voice command *and* the user's physical environment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Environmental Mapping & Device Registry:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** First device (voice input) incorporates:
    *   Wide-angle microphone array (direction of voice).
    *   Low-resolution depth sensor (e.g., time-of-flight) – identifies surfaces, approximate room dimensions.
    *   Bluetooth/Wi-Fi scanning – detects nearby devices (speakers, displays, smart lights) and their capabilities.
*   **Mapping Process:** Upon activation, the first device performs:
    *   Room geometry estimation.
    *   Device discovery and capability profiling (speaker frequency response, display resolution, light color range).
    *   Creation of a dynamic “environmental map” - a data structure representing the room and available devices.

**2. Command Interpretation & ‘Sculpting’ Profile Selection:**

*   **Voice Command Analysis:** Standard speech-to-text & intent recognition.
*   **'Sculpting' Profile Database:** Predefined profiles associating command types with environmental ‘sculpting’ behaviors. Examples:
    *   **News Briefing:** Audio from primary speaker. Ambient lighting shifts to a calming blue. Secondary display shows scrolling headlines.
    *   **Music Playback:** Audio distributed to multiple speakers for spatialized sound. Lighting pulses with the beat. Visualizer on secondary display.
    *   **Recipe Guidance:** Audio instructions from primary speaker. Display shows recipe steps. Smart lights highlight relevant kitchen tools.
*   **Dynamic Profile Adaptation:** System analyzes environment (room size, surface materials) and adjusts sculpting profile parameters (speaker volume, light intensity, visualizer complexity).

**3. Content Distribution & Synchronization:**

*   **Content Segmentation:** Incoming content (audio, video, data) is segmented into meaningful elements (narrative voice, background music, visual cues, data points).
*   **Device Assignment:** Segments are assigned to specific devices based on sculpting profile and device capabilities.
*   **Synchronization Protocol:** A low-latency synchronization protocol ensures seamless content delivery across multiple devices.  Time-stamping & predictive buffering are critical.
*   **Spatial Audio Engine:** Employs head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to create a 3D soundscape, enhancing the sense of immersion.

**4. Interactive Response & User Customization:**

*   **Gesture Control:** Integrate with a wearable device or camera to enable gesture-based control of the environmental sculpting.  (e.g., hand wave to adjust lighting, swipe to change music volume)
*   **Voice-Based Customization:** Allow users to modify sculpting profiles using voice commands. (“Make the lights brighter,” “Show the news on the kitchen display”)
*   **Learning & Adaptation:** System learns user preferences over time and automatically adjusts sculpting profiles to optimize the experience.

**Pseudocode (Core Content Distribution Loop):**

```
function distributeContent(command, content, environmentMap) {

  // 1. Select Sculpting Profile based on command
  profile = selectSculptingProfile(command, environmentMap)

  // 2. Segment Content
  segments = segmentContent(content, profile)

  // 3. Assign Segments to Devices
  deviceAssignments = assignSegmentsToDevices(segments, environmentMap, profile)

  // 4. Synchronize Content Delivery
  synchronizeContentDelivery(deviceAssignments)

  // 5. Monitor & Adapt (based on user feedback & environment)
  adaptSculpting(environmentMap)
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   First Device: Microphone array, depth sensor, Bluetooth/Wi-Fi, processing unit.
*   Second/Other Devices: Speakers, displays, smart lights – compatible with a standard communication protocol (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Mesh).
*   Optional: Wearable device with motion sensors.
