## Adaptive Forensics Based on VM Behavioral Profiling

**Concept:** Extend block-level forensics with real-time VM behavior analysis to dynamically prioritize forensic investigation, and create adaptive imaging strategies. Current systems seem to treat all file modifications and alerts equally. This system will create a ‘normal’ baseline for each VM, and flag deviations as higher priority for forensic imaging and analysis.

**Specs:**

**1. Behavioral Profiler Module:**

*   **Data Collection:** Collects system call data, network traffic metadata (destination IPs, ports, protocol), CPU/Memory usage, disk I/O patterns, and process execution data *continuously* from each running VM.
*   **Baseline Creation:** Establishes a behavioral baseline for each VM over a defined ‘learning’ period (e.g., 7 days). This baseline is a statistical model representing ‘normal’ behavior. Utilize time-series analysis, anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., isolation forests, autoencoders) to create profiles, and establish confidence intervals for behavior metrics.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Continuously compares current VM behavior against the established baseline.  Flags deviations exceeding defined thresholds (configurable per metric). Severity levels assigned based on the degree of deviation and the criticality of the metric.
*   **Output:** Generates real-time anomaly scores for each VM.  Provides a prioritized list of VMs based on anomaly score. Logs all anomaly events with timestamps and associated behavioral data.

**2. Adaptive Imaging Trigger:**

*   **Integration:** Receives anomaly scores from the Behavioral Profiler Module.
*   **Trigger Logic:** Configurable rules to trigger forensic imaging based on anomaly scores. For example:
    *   High anomaly score (e.g., >80) immediately triggers full disk imaging.
    *   Medium anomaly score (e.g., 50-80) triggers incremental imaging (only changed blocks since last image).
    *   Low anomaly score (e.g., 20-50) triggers increased logging and monitoring.
*   **Dynamic Prioritization:** Prioritizes imaging requests based on anomaly score, criticality of the VM (e.g., production vs. test), and resource availability.

**3. Intelligent Block Selection & Imaging:**

*   **Change Tracking:** Maintain a bit-level change map for each logical volume.
*   **Smart Differencing:**  During incremental imaging, only copy blocks that have changed *since the last image, and which are flagged as relevant by the Behavioral Profiler*. This combines traditional change tracking with behavioral relevance – focusing on blocks associated with anomalous activity.
*   **De-duplication:** Implement block-level de-duplication across all VM images to reduce storage requirements and imaging time.
*   **Metadata Enrichment:**  Embed anomaly scores, timestamps of anomalous activity, and associated behavioral data within the VM image metadata.

**4. Forensic Analysis Integration:**

*   **Prioritized Analysis:** The forensic analysis pipeline prioritizes images based on the embedded anomaly scores.
*   **Behavioral Context:**  The forensic tools leverage the embedded behavioral context to guide the analysis – focusing on files and processes associated with anomalous activity.
*   **Automated Correlation:** Automate the correlation of file modification timestamps, intrusion detection alert information, and behavioral data to identify root causes.



**Pseudocode (Adaptive Imaging Trigger):**

```
function triggerImaging(vmID, anomalyScore, criticality) {
  if (anomalyScore > 80) {
    imagingType = "full";
  } else if (anomalyScore > 50) {
    imagingType = "incremental";
  } else {
    imagingType = "none";
    increaseLogging(vmID);
    return;
  }

  if (resourceAvailable()) {
    if (imagingType == "full") {
      fullDiskImage(vmID);
    } else {
      incrementalImage(vmID);
    }
  } else {
    queueImagingRequest(vmID, imagingType);
  }
}

function resourceAvailable() {
  // Check storage space, CPU utilization, network bandwidth
  // Return true if sufficient resources are available
}

```
