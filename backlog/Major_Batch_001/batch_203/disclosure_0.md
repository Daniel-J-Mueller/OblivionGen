## Adaptive Packet Prioritization via Bio-Inspired Neural Networks

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Network adapter device (integrated within SoC, FPGA, or ASIC) with dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) or access to system NPU. Minimum 128MB dedicated SRAM for neural network weights and activations.
*   **Software:** Firmware module integrated into network adapter driver. Real-time operating system (RTOS) support for deterministic performance. Python API for training and updating the neural network model.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `PacketMetadata`: Structure containing packet header information, sequence identifier (as per patent claim 18), destination address, packet size, time of arrival, and calculated priority score.
    *   `NeuralNetworkModel`: Representation of a recurrent neural network (RNN) with LSTM or GRU cells, trained to predict packet priority based on input features.
    *   `PriorityQueue`: Data structure used to buffer packets based on calculated priority.

**Innovation Description:**

This system dynamically adjusts packet prioritization not based on pre-defined Quality of Service (QoS) rules, but via a bio-inspired neural network that *learns* optimal prioritization based on network conditions and application behavior. It builds on the patentâ€™s concept of maintaining transport context but adds a layer of real-time, adaptive intelligence.

The neural network is trained offline using data reflecting expected network traffic profiles and application requirements. This training data includes parameters like inter-packet arrival times, packet sizes, destination addresses, and application types. During runtime, the network adapter examines each incoming packet and extracts relevant features (from `PacketMetadata`).  These features are fed into the neural network, which outputs a priority score. Packets are then placed into a `PriorityQueue` based on this score.

**Pseudocode (Network Adapter Firmware):**

```
// Initialization
load_neural_network_model("trained_model.bin");

// Per-Packet Processing
function process_packet(packet):
  metadata = extract_metadata(packet);
  priority_score = neural_network_model.predict(metadata.features);
  priority_queue.enqueue(packet, priority_score);

  // Optionally, monitor packet status (claim 18)
  monitor_packet_status(packet);

// Background Training (Optional)
function background_training(new_training_data):
  // Periodically retrain the neural network using new data
  // to adapt to changing network conditions.
  neural_network_model.retrain(new_training_data);
```

**Key Differences/Novelty:**

*   **Adaptive Prioritization:** Existing QoS systems use static rules. This system learns and adapts.
*   **Bio-Inspired Intelligence:** Leverages the predictive power of recurrent neural networks.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Utilizes transport context information (from patent) as input to the neural network, enhancing prioritization accuracy.
*   **Real-Time Learning:** The system can be updated with new training data in the background, allowing it to adapt to changing network conditions and application requirements.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Dedicated NPU accelerates neural network inference, ensuring low latency and high throughput.
