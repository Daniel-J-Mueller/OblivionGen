## Adaptive Data Sharding with Predictive Integrity

**Concept:** Extend the idea of partitioning data for integrity verification by introducing *predictive* sharding â€“ dynamically adjusting partition sizes *during* data storage and retrieval based on predicted access patterns and data sensitivity. This builds on the patent's core concept of multiple partition schemes but adds a layer of behavioral adaptation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Access Pattern Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Data access logs (read/write frequency, data types accessed, user profiles).
*   **Process:** Utilizes a time-series forecasting algorithm (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to predict future access patterns for data objects.  Focuses on identifying 'hot' and 'cold' segments within the data.  Segments are identified with a confidence score.
*   **Output:**  Access pattern prediction report: A ranked list of data segments with predicted access frequency and a confidence score.

**2. Sensitivity Classification Module:**

*   **Input:** Data object metadata (user-defined tags, data type, origin).
*   **Process:** Employs a rule-based system or a machine learning classifier to assign a sensitivity level to each data object (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
*   **Output:** Sensitivity level for each data object.

**3. Adaptive Sharding Engine:**

*   **Input:** Access pattern prediction report, data object sensitivity level, initial partition scheme (from the base patent), configurable parameters (minimum/maximum partition size, sensitivity weighting).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Partition Scheme Selection:** Based on sensitivity level, select a base partition scheme (e.g., small partitions for high sensitivity, large partitions for low sensitivity).
    2.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**
        *   For 'hot' segments (high predicted access), dynamically *reduce* partition size to improve read performance and granularity of integrity checks.
        *   For 'cold' segments (low predicted access), dynamically *increase* partition size to reduce metadata overhead and storage space.
        *   Adjust partition boundaries to align with predicted access patterns, minimizing cross-partition reads.
    3.  **Integrity Verification:** Calculate multiple verification values per partition using the original verification algorithm.  Use the verification values from multiple partition sizes to confirm integrity across the adaptive scheme.
    4.  **Metadata Management:** Maintain a metadata map linking logical data blocks to physical partitions, tracking partition size changes over time.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function AdaptiveShard(dataObject, accessLogs, sensitivityMetadata):
  sensitivityLevel = ClassifySensitivity(sensitivityMetadata)
  basePartitionScheme = SelectBaseScheme(sensitivityLevel)
  accessPrediction = PredictAccess(accessLogs, dataObject)

  partitionMap = {}  // Map logical blocks to physical partitions
  for block in dataObject.blocks:
    predictedAccess = accessPrediction.getBlockAccess(block)
    if predictedAccess > thresholdHigh:
      partitionSize = basePartitionSize / factorHigh  // Small partition
    elif predictedAccess < thresholdLow:
      partitionSize = basePartitionSize * factorLow  // Large partition
    else:
      partitionSize = basePartitionSize

    partition = CreatePartition(block, partitionSize)
    partitionMap[block] = partition
    CalculateVerificationValue(partition)

  return partitionMap
```

**4. Verification Enhancement:**

*   **Multi-Level Digests:**  Instead of single verification values, generate a hierarchy of digests (e.g., per-partition, per-segment, object-level) to provide granular integrity checks.
*   **Temporal Digests:** Store verification values at different points in time to track changes and detect tampering.
*   **Cryptographic Anchoring:**  Cryptographically sign the digests with a key managed by a trusted entity.

**Storage Requirements:**

*   Metadata map detailing partition schemes, sizes, and timestamps.
*   Hierarchical digests.
*   Temporal verification logs.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved read/write performance by adapting to access patterns.
*   Enhanced data security through granular integrity checks.
*   Reduced storage overhead by dynamically adjusting partition sizes.
*   Better support for archival data by optimizing storage for infrequently accessed data.
