## Dynamic Network Persona Creation

**Concept:** Extend the network duplication concept to create ‘network personas’ – ephemeral, tailored network instances designed for specific simulated events or threat responses. These personas aren't static copies, but dynamically assembled from a library of pre-configured virtual devices and behavioral profiles.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Definition Language (PDL):**

*   A declarative language (YAML/JSON based) for defining network personas.
*   Fields include:
    *   `name`: Persona identifier.
    *   `description`: Human-readable description.
    *   `event_trigger`: Conditions that activate the persona (e.g., specific firewall alerts, simulated attack vectors).
    *   `duration`:  Persona lifespan (time-based or event-driven termination).
    *   `device_templates`: List of virtual device templates to instantiate. Each template includes:
        *   `type`: (switch, firewall, server, etc.)
        *   `configuration_profile`:  Pre-defined configuration settings (OS image, software packages, baseline rules).
        *   `behavioral_profile`:  (See section 2)
        *   `connectivity`: Rules defining network connections to other devices within the persona and to external networks.
    *   `resource_limits`: CPU, memory, bandwidth constraints for the persona.
    *   `logging_level`: Granularity of logging during persona operation.

**2. Behavioral Profiles:**

*   Modular definitions of device behavior.
*   Implemented as a rule engine (e.g., based on Snort rules, YARA rules, or a custom DSL).
*   Profiles define:
    *   Expected network traffic patterns (protocols, ports, frequencies).
    *   Response to specific events (e.g., port scans, malware detection).
    *   Simulated user activity (e.g., accessing specific resources, generating logs).
*   Profiles can be chained or combined to create complex behaviors.

**3. Persona Orchestration Engine:**

*   Component responsible for creating, activating, and managing personas.
*   Functions:
    *   `create_persona(pdl_definition)`:  Instantiates the persona based on the PDL definition, deploying virtual devices and configuring their behavioral profiles.
    *   `activate_persona(persona_id)`:  Routes traffic to the persona, effectively isolating it from the production network.
    *   `deactivate_persona(persona_id)`:  Removes the persona from the network, restoring normal traffic flow.
    *   `monitor_persona(persona_id)`: Collects metrics and logs from the persona for analysis.
    *   `snapshot_persona(persona_id)`:  Captures the state of the persona for later review or replay.

**4. Dynamic Routing & Traffic Mirroring:**

*   Utilize software-defined networking (SDN) principles to dynamically route traffic to personas.
*   Implement traffic mirroring to send a copy of production traffic to a persona for testing or analysis without impacting production systems.

**Pseudocode (Persona Orchestration Engine – `create_persona` function):**

```
function create_persona(pdl_definition) {
  persona_id = generate_unique_id()
  for each device_template in pdl_definition.device_templates {
    virtual_device = instantiate_device(device_template.type, device_template.configuration_profile)
    apply_behavioral_profile(virtual_device, device_template.behavioral_profile)
    connect_device(virtual_device, pdl_definition.connectivity)
  }
  set_persona_resource_limits(persona_id, pdl_definition.resource_limits)
  set_persona_logging_level(persona_id, pdl_definition.logging_level)
  return persona_id
}
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Cybersecurity Threat Simulation:** Create realistic attack environments to test defenses.
*   **Application Testing:** Simulate production traffic to validate application performance and scalability.
*   **Incident Response Training:** Provide a safe environment for security teams to practice incident response procedures.
*   **Vulnerability Research:** Isolate and analyze vulnerabilities without impacting production systems.
