## Dynamic Environmental Storytelling via Gaze-Contingent Narrative Insertion

**Concept:** Extend gaze tracking beyond area of interest determination to dynamically insert narrative elements – audio, visual effects, or even limited AR overlays – directly into the user's perceived environment within the panoramic video. This turns passive viewing into a subtly interactive storytelling experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** 360° Video Data, Gaze Vectors (per viewer/head detected – as per patent), Pre-authored “Narrative Fragments” (audio clips, short visual effects, AR models – categorized by environment/object type).
*   **Environment Mapping:** Generate a dynamic 3D environment map from the video data (similar to patent claim 8). This map serves as the spatial anchor for narrative insertion.
*   **Object Recognition & Tagging:** Implement object recognition (using machine learning) to identify key objects/areas within the environment map. These objects are tagged with metadata indicating potential narrative associations (e.g., "Old Tree" -> "Folklore Story," "Abandoned House" -> "Ghost Story").
*   **Gaze-Triggered Narrative Selection:**
    *   Continuously monitor gaze vectors.
    *   Raycast from gaze vector into the 3D environment map to identify the intersected object.
    *   Retrieve associated narrative fragments for that object.
    *   Employ a “relevance score” – based on gaze duration, gaze stability, and proximity of multiple gazes (if multiple viewers are present) – to determine the likelihood of triggering a narrative fragment.
*   **Narrative Insertion Engine:**
    *   **Audio:** Spatialized audio playback (pan, distance falloff) corresponding to the gazed-at object. The audio should blend seamlessly with the existing video audio.
    *   **Visual Effects:** Subtle visual effects (e.g., a momentary glow, a flickering light, a brief apparition) overlaid onto the video stream, localized to the gazed-at object.
    *   **AR Overlay (Advanced):** If sufficient processing power and AR hardware are available, overlay simple 3D AR models onto the video stream, anchored to the gazed-at object.  These models should be stylized and non-intrusive.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment & Coherence:**
    *   Maintain a “narrative state” to track triggered fragments and avoid repetition or conflicting narratives.
    *   Adjust the timing and intensity of narrative insertion based on user activity and environmental changes.
    *   Employ a “coherence filter” to ensure that triggered fragments align with the overall narrative flow.
*   **Multi-User Synchronization:** (For shared viewing experiences)
    *   Share gaze data between viewers.
    *   Prioritize narrative insertion based on the collective gaze of the group.
    *   Allow viewers to “vote” on narrative choices.

**Pseudocode (Narrative Insertion Loop):**

```
Loop:
    For each viewer:
        raycast = Raycast(viewer.gazeVector, environmentMap)
        If raycast.hit:
            object = raycast.hit.object
            narrativeFragments = object.getNarrativeFragments()
            relevanceScore = CalculateRelevanceScore(viewer.gazeDuration, viewer.gazeStability, viewer.proximityToOtherGazes)
            If relevanceScore > threshold:
                fragment = SelectFragment(narrativeFragments, relevanceScore)
                If fragment.notYetTriggered:
                    TriggerFragment(fragment)
                    fragment.markAsTriggered()
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Immersive storytelling experiences.
*   Interactive museum tours.
*   Enhanced virtual tourism.
*   Gamified exploration of panoramic environments.
*   Personalized learning experiences.
