## Adaptive Predictive Power Allocation & Energy Harvesting

**System Overview:** Integrate a predictive algorithm with the existing power management system, coupled with localized energy harvesting to dynamically optimize doorbell operation and extend battery life indefinitely.

**Core Innovation:** Move beyond simply *limiting* AC power draw to *predicting* power needs and proactively supplementing with harvested energy *before* AC power is strained.

**Specifications:**

*   **Energy Harvesting Module:**
    *   Type: Piezoelectric Vibration Harvester & Miniature Thermoelectric Generator (TEG)
    *   Location: Integrated into doorbell mounting plate, utilizing vibrations from door knocks/nearby sounds & temperature differential between doorbell and wall.
    *   Output: DC voltage regulated to 3.7V, stored in a supercapacitor bank (minimum 100mF).
*   **Predictive Algorithm:**
    *   Data Inputs:
        *   Historical usage patterns (time of day, day of week, seasonal variations).
        *   Motion sensor data (detecting approaching individuals).
        *   Audio analysis (detecting knocking/doorbell press sounds *before* physical impact).
        *   Network data (scheduled deliveries, visitor notifications).
    *   Algorithm Type: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture.  Trained to predict future power consumption 1-5 seconds in advance.
    *   Output: Projected power demand curve (mW) for the next 5 seconds.
*   **Power Management Controller:**
    *   Primary Power Source: AC/DC rectifier & DC/DC converter (as existing).  Maximum draw: 1.4A (configurable).
    *   Secondary Power Source: Supercapacitor bank (from energy harvesting).
    *   Control Logic:
        1.  RNN predicts power demand.
        2.  If predicted demand < 1.4A, prioritize charging supercapacitor bank with excess AC power.
        3.  If predicted demand > 1.4A:
            *   Draw 1.4A from AC.
            *   Supplement remaining power from supercapacitor bank.
        4.  Implement a “boost” mode:  During high-demand events (video streaming, two-way communication), temporarily discharge supercapacitor bank to provide peak power while maintaining 1.4A AC draw.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   Local: I2C communication between energy harvesting module, RNN processor, and power management controller.
    *   Network: Utilize existing Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity to transmit usage data to cloud for model retraining and performance optimization.
*   **Firmware Updates:** Over-the-air (OTA) updates for RNN model and power management algorithms.

**Pseudocode (Power Management Controller):**

```
// Variables
float predictedPowerDemand;
float acPowerDraw;
float supercapPowerSupply;

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    predictedPowerDemand = getPredictedPowerDemand();

    if (predictedPowerDemand < 1.4) {
        acPowerDraw = predictedPowerDemand;
        supercapPowerSupply = 0;
        chargeSupercapacitor(1.4 - predictedPowerDemand); // Charge with excess AC power
    } else {
        acPowerDraw = 1.4;
        supercapPowerSupply = predictedPowerDemand - 1.4;
        dischargeSupercapacitor(supercapPowerSupply);
    }

    // Apply power to doorbell components
    supplyPower(acPowerDraw, supercapPowerSupply);
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Indefinite Battery Life:** Energy harvesting can offset power consumption, eliminating the need for battery replacements.
*   **Increased Reliability:** Reduced reliance on battery power improves system stability and minimizes downtime.
*   **Enhanced Performance:** Supercapacitor boost mode ensures consistent power delivery during demanding tasks.
*   **Smart Energy Management:** Predictive algorithm optimizes power usage and minimizes environmental impact.
