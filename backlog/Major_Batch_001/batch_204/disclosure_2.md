## Adaptive Haptic Ring for Multi-User Spatial Audio

**Concept:** Expand on the light ring concept to incorporate localized haptic feedback, creating a spatially aware communication experience. This isn't just *seeing* who's talking, but *feeling* where they are in relation to the user.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Circular haptic ring (approx. 8-10 inch diameter) comprised of individually addressable linear resonant actuators (LRAs) or ultrasonic transducers. Minimum 64 actuators, ideally 128 or 256 for finer granularity.
    *   Integrated multi-microphone array (beamforming capable) for accurate source localization.
    *   High-precision inertial measurement unit (IMU) to track head/body orientation.
    *   Bluetooth 5.2 or Wi-Fi 6E connectivity for wireless communication.
    *   USB-C for power and potential data transfer.
    *   Adjustable strap/mount for secure attachment (headband, desk mount, etc.).
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Real-time audio processing pipeline.
    *   Beamforming algorithm to estimate the direction of arrival (DoA) of each speaker's voice.
    *   Head tracking algorithm to compensate for user head movements.
    *   Spatial mapping algorithm to translate DoA and head tracking data into actuator activation patterns.
    *   User profile management (for contact association/customization).
    *   API for integration with conferencing platforms.

**Operation:**

1.  The microphone array captures audio from the surrounding environment.
2.  The beamforming algorithm identifies the dominant sound source (the active speaker).
3.  The head tracking algorithm determines the user's orientation.
4.  The spatial mapping algorithm calculates the relative direction of the speaker from the userâ€™s perspective.
5.  The algorithm activates a specific set of LRAs on the haptic ring corresponding to the calculated direction. The intensity of the LRA activation corresponds to the loudness or prominence of the speaker's voice.
6.  Multiple speakers will result in multiple activated LRAs, creating a distributed haptic representation of the conversational space.
7.  User profiles can be used to associate specific contacts with unique haptic patterns (e.g., different vibration frequencies or intensities).

**Pseudocode (Spatial Mapping Algorithm):**

```
function map_audio_to_haptics(audio_data, head_orientation):
    doa = calculate_direction_of_arrival(audio_data)  // Returns angle in degrees
    relative_angle = doa - head_orientation
    normalized_angle = wrap_angle(relative_angle) // Ensure angle is between 0 and 360
    actuator_index = map_angle_to_actuator(normalized_angle, num_actuators)
    activation_intensity = calculate_intensity(audio_data)
    activate_actuator(actuator_index, activation_intensity)
end function

function wrap_angle(angle):
    while angle < 0:
        angle += 360
    while angle >= 360:
        angle -= 360
    return angle
end function

function map_angle_to_actuator(angle, num_actuators):
    return int(angle / (360 / num_actuators))
end function

function calculate_intensity(audio_data):
    // Calculate intensity based on volume, speech recognition confidence, etc.
    // Implement appropriate scaling and normalization.
    return intensity
end function
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Dynamic Intensity Mapping:** Adjust haptic intensity based on distance to speaker (estimated via audio processing).
*   **Multi-Layered Haptics:** Incorporate texture or temperature variations into the haptic ring for richer sensory feedback.
*   **Ambient Awareness:** Integrate environmental audio cues (e.g., approaching vehicles) into the haptic display.
*    **Directional Sound Coupling:** Integrate micro speakers into the ring, directed towards the user's ear, to complement the haptic and visual information.
