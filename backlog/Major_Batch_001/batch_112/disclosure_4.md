## Dynamic Chimney Array - Heat Reclamation & Distribution

**Concept:** Expand upon the passive exhaust concept by creating a modular, dynamically adjustable chimney array capable of not only exhausting warm air but also *reclaiming* and *redistributing* that heat within the structure. This system will move beyond simple exhaust to become an active thermal regulation component.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Dimensions:** 60cm x 60cm x 80cm (H). Standardized size for interoperability.
*   **Module Construction:** Double-walled, vacuum-insulated stainless steel. Internal heat exchanger matrix composed of high-thermal-conductivity copper alloy.
*   **Chimney Core:** A central, vertically-oriented chimney core within each module, acting as the primary exhaust path.
*   **Heat Exchanger:** Surrounding the chimney core, a network of microchannels filled with a thermally conductive fluid (e.g., nanofluid with enhanced heat transfer properties).
*   **Fluid Circulation:** Each module contains a miniature, low-power thermoelectric pump to circulate the heat transfer fluid.
*   **Fluid Distribution Manifold:** A network of interconnected manifolds beneath the roof, connecting all modules. This allows fluid to be circulated between modules and a central thermal storage tank.
*   **Thermal Storage Tank:** A large, insulated tank containing a phase-change material (PCM) to store excess heat for later use.
*   **Control System:** A distributed sensor network monitoring temperature, humidity, and airflow within each module and throughout the structure.  A central controller manages pump speeds, fluid flow rates, and exhaust damper positions.
*   **Damper System:** Each module features adjustable dampers controlling both exhaust airflow and the amount of reclaimed heat directed back into the structure.
*   **Exterior Shielding:** UV-resistant, weatherproof shielding around each module, integrated with solar cells for supplemental power.

**Operation:**

1.  **Warm Air Capture:** Warm air rises and enters modules through roof voids, as in the original patent.
2.  **Heat Extraction:** As air passes through the heat exchanger matrix, heat is transferred to the circulating fluid.
3.  **Heat Transfer & Storage:** Heated fluid is circulated to the thermal storage tank, storing excess heat.  Fluid can also be circulated to other modules requiring heat.
4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The control system continuously monitors thermal conditions and adjusts damper positions and pump speeds to optimize heat capture, storage, and distribution. Modules can function as pure exhaust, pure heat reclaim, or a combination of both.
5.  **Zonal Control:**  Modules are grouped into zones, allowing for independent thermal regulation of different areas of the structure.
6.  **Integration with HVAC:** The system integrates with existing HVAC systems, providing supplemental heating and cooling as needed.

**Pseudocode (Control System):**

```
// Define parameters
float targetTemperature;
float moduleTemperature[N]; // N = number of modules
float storageTankTemperature;
float pumpSpeed[N];
float damperPosition[N];

// Main loop
while (true) {
    // Read sensor data
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        moduleTemperature[i] = readTemperature(moduleSensor[i]);
    }
    storageTankTemperature = readTemperature(storageTankSensor);

    // Calculate average module temperature
    float averageTemperature = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        averageTemperature += moduleTemperature[i];
    }
    averageTemperature /= N;

    // Control logic
    if (averageTemperature > targetTemperature + 2) {
        // Increase exhaust, reduce reclaim
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            damperPosition[i] = min(1.0, damperPosition[i] + 0.05);
            pumpSpeed[i] = max(0.0, pumpSpeed[i] - 0.05);
        }
    } else if (averageTemperature < targetTemperature - 2) {
        // Reduce exhaust, increase reclaim
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            damperPosition[i] = max(0.0, damperPosition[i] - 0.05);
            pumpSpeed[i] = min(1.0, pumpSpeed[i] + 0.05);
        }
    }

    // Apply control signals
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        setDamperPosition(damperActuator[i], damperPosition[i]);
        setPumpSpeed(pumpActuator[i], pumpSpeed[i]);
    }

    delay(60); // Update every 60 seconds
}
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond passive exhaust to create an active thermal management system. It reclaims waste heat, stores it for later use, and distributes it throughout the structure, reducing energy consumption and improving thermal comfort. The dynamic adjustability allows the system to respond to changing conditions and optimize performance. The integration of solar cells provides a sustainable power source.
