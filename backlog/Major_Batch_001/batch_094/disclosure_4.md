## Dynamic Query Result 'Ecosystems'

**Concept:** Expand the idea of contextual information insertion beyond simple additional items/content. Instead, create a dynamically generated “ecosystem” of related information *around* the primary query result, visualized as interactive nodes within the user interface.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Structure – ‘Information Graph’:**

*   Each item in the catalog is a node in a graph.
*   Edges between nodes represent relationships (e.g., “frequently bought together”, “similar features”, “part of a set”, “complementary product”, “user reviews mentioning both”). Edge weight indicates relationship strength.
*   Relationships are calculated using a combination of:
    *   Purchase history data.
    *   Product metadata.
    *   Natural Language Processing (NLP) of user reviews & product descriptions.
    *   Clickstream data (items viewed together).

**2. Query Processing & Ecosystem Generation:**

*   Upon receiving a query, identify the primary item node.
*   Traverse the graph outwards from the primary node, identifying related nodes based on edge weight and a ‘relevance threshold’.
*   Nodes exceeding the threshold become members of the ‘query ecosystem’.
*   Ecosystem node types:
    *   **Directly Related:** Strongest connections – frequent co-purchases, key accessories.
    *   **Complementary:** Items enhancing the primary item’s functionality.
    *   **Alternative:** Similar items offering different features/price points.
    *   **Informational:** User reviews, expert articles, comparison charts.
    *   **Community:** Forum threads, social media posts referencing the item.

**3. User Interface – Interactive Node Visualization:**

*   Primary query result displayed prominently.
*   Ecosystem nodes visualized as orbiting ‘bubbles’ or interconnected nodes around the primary result.
*   Node size corresponds to relationship strength/relevance.
*   Node color indicates node type (e.g., blue = direct relation, green = informational).
*   **Interaction:**
    *   Hovering over a node displays a summary of the related item/information.
    *   Clicking a node expands it to reveal more details (e.g., a product page, a review excerpt).
    *   Users can ‘pin’ or ‘hide’ nodes to customize their ecosystem view.
    *   The ecosystem adapts in real-time based on user interactions (e.g., if a user clicks on a ‘repair guide’ node, the system prioritizes nodes related to maintenance).

**4.  Dynamic Relevance Adjustment:**

*   The system continuously monitors user behavior within the ecosystem.
*   If a user consistently ignores certain node types (e.g., ‘alternative products’), the system reduces the weight of those connections in future queries.
*   Personalized ecosystems develop over time based on user preferences.
*   Utilize reinforcement learning to optimize ecosystem relevance and user engagement.

**Pseudocode (Ecosystem Generation):**

```
function generateEcosystem(query, primaryItemNode, graph):
    ecosystemNodes = []
    visitedNodes = {primaryItemNode} // To avoid cycles
    queue = [primaryItemNode]

    while queue:
        currentNode = queue.pop(0)

        for neighbor, weight in currentNode.neighbors.items():
            if neighbor not in visitedNodes and weight > RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD:
                ecosystemNodes.append((neighbor, weight))
                visitedNodes.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)

    // Sort nodes by weight (descending)
    ecosystemNodes.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    return ecosystemNodes
```
