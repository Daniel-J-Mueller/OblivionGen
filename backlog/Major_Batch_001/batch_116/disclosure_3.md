## Dynamic Vendor Collaboration & Predictive Allocation

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing budget & allocation system to include a real-time, collaborative platform for vendors to directly influence allocation based on predictive modeling and their own internal data – shifting from a ‘push’ to a ‘pull’ system.

**System Specs:**

*   **Vendor Portal:** Secure web/app interface for registered vendors.
*   **Data Integration API:**  Bi-directional API allowing vendors to upload/integrate internal data (inventory, production capacity, projected lead times, marketing plans, promotional calendars). Data must be validated against schema.
*   **Predictive Modeling Engine:**  Leverages historical sales, vendor data, external market trends (social media sentiment, weather, economic indicators) to forecast demand at a granular level (SKU, location, timeframe). Model trained on both platform data & integrated vendor data.
*   **Collaborative Allocation Interface:**  Visual interface displaying projected demand, current allocation, vendor capacity, and potential revenue impact. Allows vendors to ‘suggest’ adjustments to allocated budget based on their forecasts. These suggestions are presented as ‘what-if’ scenarios.
*   **Automated Negotiation Engine:** AI-powered engine that analyzes vendor suggestions against overall business goals, inventory constraints, and other vendor proposals. Engine proposes compromises and optimal allocation scenarios. 
*   **Commitment Signal Integration:** Signals from the Commitment Tracker feed directly into the Predictive Modeling Engine, refining forecasts and informing allocation decisions. Changes in commitment levels trigger immediate re-evaluation of allocations.
*   **Dynamic Budget Adjustment Rules:**  Rules engine that automatically adjusts allocated budget based on pre-defined criteria (e.g., vendor performance, market shifts, promotional events).
*   **Alerting & Notification System:**  Real-time alerts for critical events (e.g., low inventory, capacity constraints, significant forecast deviations).
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Granular access control to protect sensitive data.

**Pseudocode - Allocation Adjustment Loop:**

```
//Main Loop runs periodically (e.g. hourly)

FOR EACH Vendor
    GET Vendor’s Projected Demand (from Predictive Model)
    GET Vendor’s Current Allocation
    GET Vendor’s Capacity Constraints

    Vendor Suggestion = Vendor.SuggestAllocationAdjustment(Projected Demand, Current Allocation, Capacity Constraints)

    IF Vendor Suggestion Valid THEN
        Negotiated Allocation = NegotiationEngine.Negotiate(Vendor Suggestion, OverallBudget, OtherVendorSuggestions)
    ELSE
        Negotiated Allocation = Current Allocation

    IF Negotiated Allocation != Current Allocation THEN
        Update Budget Allocation
        Send Notification to Vendor & Internal Stakeholders
    ENDIF
ENDIF
```

**Data Schemas (Example - Vendor Data):**

```json
{
  "vendor_id": "string",
  "production_capacity": {
    "units_per_week": "integer",
    "lead_time_days": "integer"
  },
  "inventory_levels": [
    {
      "sku": "string",
      "quantity": "integer"
    }
  ],
  "marketing_calendar": [
    {
      "event_name": "string",
      "start_date": "date",
      "end_date": "date",
      "expected_impact": "float" // Expected sales lift
    }
  ]
}
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems are largely ‘push’ based. This adds a ‘pull’ element, leveraging vendor intelligence to improve forecasting accuracy and reduce waste. The integration of vendor data *directly* into the predictive modeling engine is a key differentiator. The automated negotiation engine adds a layer of sophistication lacking in current solutions.
