**Dynamic Resource Bundling & Predictive Storage**

**Concept:** Expand the idea of grouping network resources, but move beyond simple metadata or attributes. Implement *dynamic* resource bundling based on user interaction *and* predictive storage allocation. The goal is to anticipate user needs *before* explicit requests, pre-staging resources for seamless access, and intelligently managing storage costs.

**Specs:**

**1. Interaction Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time browser activity – URLs visited, time spent on page, scrolling behavior, element interactions (clicks, hovers, form entries), content type (images, video, text), identified entities within content (names, places, products via NER - Named Entity Recognition).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Affinity Scoring:** Assign an affinity score to network resources based on user interaction. Higher scores indicate a higher probability of future access.  Use a decaying average to give more weight to recent interactions.
    *   **Co-occurrence Analysis:** Identify resources frequently accessed *together*. This could be pages within a website, or resources across different websites related to a single topic.
    *   **Temporal Analysis:** Track access patterns over time.  Identify resources accessed at specific times of day or days of the week.
*   **Output:** A dynamic “interest profile” for the user, listing ranked network resources and associated affinity scores.

**2. Predictive Storage Engine:**

*   **Input:** User’s interest profile (from Interaction Analysis Module). Available storage tiers (cost, speed, redundancy).  User-defined storage preferences (e.g., preferred storage location, maximum storage cost).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Resource Bundling:** Group network resources based on affinity scores and co-occurrence analysis. Create "bundles" of related content.
    *   **Storage Tier Assignment:** Dynamically assign storage tiers to resource bundles based on predicted access frequency and user preferences. Frequently accessed bundles are assigned to faster, more expensive tiers. Infrequently accessed bundles are assigned to slower, cheaper tiers.
    *   **Pre-staging:** Automatically download and store resource bundles to the assigned storage tiers *before* the user explicitly requests them.  Employ a "warm-up" period, where resources are pre-staged with lower priority, and then promoted to higher priority as the predicted access time approaches.
*   **Output:** A storage allocation plan, specifying which resource bundles are stored in which storage tiers.

**3. Browser Integration:**

*   **Transparent Access:** When the user accesses a network resource, the browser first checks if it is already stored locally. If so, it loads the resource from local storage. This happens transparently, without any user intervention.
*   **Dynamic Bundle Adjustment:** Monitor user behavior and dynamically adjust resource bundles and storage tier assignments. If a resource is accessed more or less frequently than predicted, adjust the bundle and storage tier accordingly.
*   **User Controls:** Provide the user with controls to customize storage preferences, view storage allocation plans, and manually adjust resource bundles.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Interaction Analysis Module
function analyzeInteraction(url, interactionType, timestamp) {
  // Update affinity score for URL
  affinityScores[url] = calculateAffinityScore(affinityScores[url], interactionType, timestamp);
  // Update co-occurrence matrix
  updateCoOccurrenceMatrix(url);
}

// Predictive Storage Engine
function allocateStorage(userProfile) {
  bundles = createBundles(userProfile);
  for (bundle in bundles) {
    tier = determineStorageTier(bundle);
    storeBundle(bundle, tier);
  }
}

// Browser Integration
function accessResource(url) {
  if (isResourceCached(url)) {
    loadResourceFromCache(url);
  } else {
    loadResourceFromNetwork(url);
    cacheResource(url);
  }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Performance:** Faster access to frequently used resources.
*   **Reduced Bandwidth Costs:** Less data downloaded from the network.
*   **Optimized Storage Costs:** Intelligent allocation of resources to different storage tiers.
*   **Seamless User Experience:** Transparent access to resources without any user intervention.
*   **Proactive Content Delivery:** Anticipate user needs and pre-stage content for seamless access.
