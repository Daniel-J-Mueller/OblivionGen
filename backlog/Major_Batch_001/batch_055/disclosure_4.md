## Dynamic Resolution Pixel Shifting with Predictive Interlace

**Concept:** Enhance perceived resolution and reduce bandwidth requirements by dynamically shifting pixel data *within* a frame, leveraging predictive interlacing based on motion vectors.

**Specifications:**

*   **Display Hardware:** Compatible with existing interlaced or progressive scan displays. Requires a display timing controller with a high-speed internal buffer (at least 2x the displayed resolution) and support for sub-pixel manipulation.

*   **Image Processing Unit (IPU):**
    *   **Motion Vector Analysis:** Analyze incoming video frames to generate dense motion vectors. Utilize optical flow algorithms for accuracy.
    *   **Resolution Prediction:** Based on motion vectors, predict areas of high and low detail. Areas with minimal motion are considered suitable for reduced resolution, while areas of high motion require full/enhanced resolution.
    *   **Pixel Shift Mapping:** Generate a pixel shift map for each frame. This map dictates how each pixel should be shifted horizontally and vertically by sub-pixel increments (e.g., 0.25, 0.5 pixel). The shift is determined by the predicted resolution for that pixel's region and the overall image characteristics. Regions of low detail receive larger shifts, effectively increasing the sampling rate in high-detail areas.
    *   **Interlace Pattern Generation:**  Instead of a fixed interlacing pattern, the IPU dynamically generates an interlace pattern based on the pixel shift map.  This allows for prioritizing the display of shifted pixels from high-detail regions during the active scan lines, and strategically placing lower-detail pixels in less noticeable areas.
    *   **Adaptive Frame Rate Control:** Adjust frame rate dynamically based on computational load and perceived visual quality.  Prioritize maintaining a smooth viewing experience, even if it requires reducing the overall frame rate slightly.

*   **Display Timing Controller (DTC) Enhancements:**
    *   **Sub-Pixel Addressability:**  Support for addressing individual sub-pixels within each pixel.
    *   **Dynamic Interlace Control:** Ability to dynamically adjust the interlacing pattern on a frame-by-frame basis.
    *   **Shift Buffer:** High-speed buffer to store shifted pixel data before it is sent to the display.
    *   **Pixel Correction:** Implement algorithms to correct any artifacts caused by the pixel shifting process (e.g., blurring, color fringing).

**Pseudocode (IPU â€“ simplified):**

```
FOR each frame:
    Calculate motion vectors
    FOR each pixel:
        IF motion vector magnitude < threshold:
            resolution = low
        ELSE:
            resolution = high

        IF resolution == low:
            shift_x = random(-0.5, 0.5)  // Sub-pixel shift
            shift_y = random(-0.5, 0.5)
        ELSE:
            shift_x = 0
            shift_y = 0

        pixel_data[x + shift_x][y + shift_y] = original_pixel_data[x][y]

    Generate Interlace Pattern based on pixel shift data
    Send shifted pixel data and interlace pattern to DTC
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static interlacing or fixed resolution shifting by combining dynamic resolution prediction, sub-pixel shifting, and adaptive interlacing. This approach provides a greater degree of flexibility and control over the displayed image, potentially resulting in a higher perceived resolution and a more efficient use of bandwidth. It dynamically adapts the display characteristics to the content being viewed, optimizing the viewing experience for each frame.
