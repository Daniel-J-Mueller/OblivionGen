## Dynamic Permission Drift Analysis & Predictive Mitigation

**Concept:** Extend the existing authorization data collection to actively identify "permission drift" – the gradual accumulation of unnecessary or overly broad permissions granted to users or services. This system will not just *collect* data, but *analyze* it to predict potential security risks *before* they are exploited, and then automatically propose mitigation strategies.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Augmentation:**

*   Modify existing usage data records to include a "permission entropy" score. This score is calculated based on the diversity of permissions actually *used* within a specific timeframe for a given principal (user/service).  Higher entropy = wider range of permissions used.
*   Add a "permission coverage" metric, representing the percentage of granted permissions *not* utilized within the timeframe.
*   Capture "permission chains" - sequences of permission usage during a single transaction/operation.  This provides context beyond individual permission grants.

**2. Drift Detection Engine:**

*   **Baseline Establishment:**  For each principal, establish a baseline profile of "normal" permission usage (entropy, coverage, common permission chains). Utilize historical data for this.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement a time-series anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to monitor permission entropy and coverage over time.  Alert when deviations exceed a configurable threshold.
*   **Chain Analysis:** Analyze permission chains for unexpected or unusual sequences. Flag chains that deviate significantly from established norms or represent potentially risky combinations.
*   **Risk Scoring:** Assign a risk score to each principal based on the combined output of anomaly detection and chain analysis. Factor in the sensitivity of the resources accessed.

**3. Predictive Mitigation Engine:**

*   **Automated Recommendation:** Generate recommendations for permission revocation or tightening based on risk scores and drift patterns.  Prioritize recommendations based on potential impact.
*   **Just-in-Time (JIT) Access:** Implement a JIT access control mechanism. Instead of granting standing permissions, temporarily grant only the minimum necessary permissions for a specific operation, based on real-time analysis of the operation’s requirements.
*   **Policy Generation:**  Automatically generate policy updates that reflect recommended permission adjustments.
*   **Simulation & Testing:**  Before implementing any policy changes, simulate the impact on existing applications and services to identify potential disruptions.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Data Pipeline:** Existing data collection framework augmented to capture new metrics.
*   **Analysis Engine:** Microservice responsible for drift detection, risk scoring, and recommendation generation.  Utilize machine learning models.
*   **Policy Management Interface:** UI for reviewing recommendations, approving policy changes, and monitoring system health.
*   **API Integration:** APIs for integration with existing access control systems (e.g., IAM, RBAC).

**Pseudocode (Drift Detection Engine):**

```
function detectDrift(principal, usageData):
  baseline = getBaseline(principal)
  entropy = calculateEntropy(usageData)
  coverage = calculateCoverage(usageData)
  chainScore = calculateChainScore(usageData, baseline)

  driftScore = (entropy - baseline.entropy) + (coverage - baseline.coverage) + chainScore

  if driftScore > threshold:
    riskLevel = calculateRiskLevel(driftScore)
    return riskLevel, driftScore
  else:
    return "normal", 0
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `BaselineProfile`:  `{entropy: float, coverage: float, commonChains: list}`
*   `UsageData`: `list of {permission: string, timestamp: datetime}`
*   `RiskLevel`:  `{level: string, severity: int, recommendations: list}`
