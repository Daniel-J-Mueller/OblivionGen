## Dynamic Power Distribution & Harvesting - Multi-Device Ecosystem

**Concept:** Expand the dynamic power management beyond a single device/battery pack relationship to a localized, multi-device ecosystem capable of intelligent power sharing and ambient energy harvesting.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Unit - “Nexus”:**

*   **Processor:** ARM Cortex-M7 (or equivalent) - for handling complex power distribution algorithms and communication.
*   **Communication:** Integrated Wi-Fi 6E/Bluetooth 5.3 - for device discovery, communication, and potential cloud connectivity (for analytics/firmware updates).
*   **Power Input/Output:**
    *   DC Input: 5V-20V (USB-C PD compatible) - for external power source.
    *   Wireless Charging Receiver (Qi standard) – for ambient wireless power capture.
    *   Multiple (4-8) configurable Power Ports: USB-C (PD), USB-A (QC), and dedicated battery connectors (Li-Ion, LiPo, NiMH) – to support diverse device types.
    *   Dedicated Port for Solar Panel Connection (voltage range 5-30V).
*   **Energy Storage:** High-density Li-Ion battery (capacity scalable – 5000mAh – 20000mAh) – serves as buffer and emergency power source.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   Voltage/Current sensors on each Power Port.
    *   Ambient Light Sensor.
    *   Temperature Sensor (internal & external).

**2. Device Nodes ("Satellites"):**

*   Minimalist design. Focus on power receiving capability.
*   Communication: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) – for broadcasting power needs and receiving allocation commands.
*   Power Input: USB-C (PD) or dedicated connector.
*   Battery Monitoring: Report battery level and charging status to the Nexus.

**3. Software & Algorithm:**

*   **Device Discovery:** Nexus scans for nearby Satellite nodes via BLE.
*   **Power Negotiation:** Satellites broadcast power requirements (voltage, current, minimum level). Nexus calculates optimal allocation based on:
    *   Nexus battery level.
    *   Available input power (external source, solar, wireless).
    *   Priority assigned to each Satellite (user configurable via mobile app).
*   **Dynamic Allocation:** Continuously adjusts power delivery to Satellites based on changing conditions.
*   **Energy Harvesting Integration:** Prioritizes power distribution from harvested sources (solar, wireless) before drawing from the battery or external input.
*   **Predictive Power Management:** Uses historical usage data to anticipate power needs and proactively allocate resources.
*   **Load Balancing:** Distributes load across multiple Satellites to prevent overheating or battery degradation.
*   **Emergency Mode:** Shuts down non-critical Satellites to conserve power in case of low battery.
*   **User Interface:** Mobile app for:
    *   Device management (add/remove Satellites, assign priority).
    *   Energy usage monitoring.
    *   Setting power preferences.
    *   Firmware updates.

**Pseudocode (Power Allocation):**

```
function allocatePower() {
  // 1. Gather power requests from all Satellites
  requests = getSatelliteRequests()

  // 2. Calculate total power available
  availablePower = getAvailablePower()

  // 3. Sort Satellites by priority
  sortedSatellites = sortSatellitesByPriority(satellites)

  // 4. Iterate through sorted Satellites
  for each satellite in sortedSatellites {
    // 5. Determine allocated power based on request and available power
    allocatedPower = min(satellite.request, availablePower)

    // 6. Update available power
    availablePower -= allocatedPower

    // 7. Send power allocation command to Satellite
    sendPowerAllocation(satellite, allocatedPower)
  }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Portable workstation for photographers/videographers.
*   Mobile gaming setup.
*   Emergency power backup for essential devices.
*   Off-grid power solution for camping/outdoor activities.
*   Smart home energy management system.
