## Dynamic Acoustic Feature Weighting with User-Specific Noise Profiles

**Concept:** Extend dynamic weight adjustment to not just language model transitions, but also to acoustic feature weighting based on a continuous, user-specific noise profile.

**Specification:**

**I. Noise Profile Generation & Maintenance:**

1.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement a background audio monitoring system on the user’s device (microphone always active – optional user control).
2.  **Feature Extraction:** Continuously extract acoustic features from the background audio (e.g., spectral centroid, noise floor, harmonicity).
3.  **Noise Profile Creation:** Create a dynamic “noise profile” representing the ambient sound environment. This profile is a vector of weighted acoustic features.  Weights can be updated using a moving average or Kalman filter.
4.  **User Association:**  Associate the noise profile with the user account.
5.  **Profile Storage:** Store noise profiles either locally (on device) or centrally (in the cloud). Local storage prioritizes privacy, central storage enables cross-device consistency.
6.  **Noise Event Detection:** Implement a system to detect significant noise events (e.g., sudden loud noises, speech from another source).  These events trigger an immediate profile update.

**II. Acoustic Feature Weighting Integration:**

1.  **Feature Map:** Define a map of acoustic features used by the ASR system (e.g., MFCCs, PLP).
2.  **Weight Adjustment:** During ASR, dynamically adjust the weights of these features based on the user’s current noise profile.
    *   Features correlated with noise in the user’s profile receive *reduced* weights.
    *   Features less affected by noise receive *increased* weights.
3.  **Weight Calculation Pseudocode:**

    ```
    // Input:
    //   userNoiseProfile: Vector of noise feature weights
    //   acousticFeatureVector: Vector of acoustic feature values
    //   baseFeatureWeights: Baseline weights for each acoustic feature

    // Output: Adjusted feature weights

    adjustedFeatureWeights = {}
    for i in range(length(acousticFeatureVector)):
        noiseCorrelation = calculateCorrelation(acousticFeatureVector[i], userNoiseProfile[i])
        adjustedWeight = baseFeatureWeights[i] * (1 - noiseCorrelation) // Scale by (1-correlation)
        adjustedFeatureWeights[i] = adjustedWeight

    return adjustedFeatureWeights
    ```

4.  **Contextual Blending:** Combine the noise-adjusted weights with the existing dynamic language model weights (from the source patent). This requires a blending function to ensure compatibility and prevent one system from overwhelming the other. Consider a weighted sum or a more complex non-linear function.

**III.  System Architecture**

1.  **Noise Profile Manager:** A dedicated module responsible for generating, storing, and updating user noise profiles.
2.  **ASR Feature Weighting Module:** A module integrated with the ASR engine.  It receives the user noise profile from the Noise Profile Manager and dynamically adjusts the acoustic feature weights.
3.  **Context Manager:**  A module responsible for integrating the noise-adjusted feature weights with the dynamic language model weights.
4.  **API:** Expose an API for third-party applications to access the user noise profile and contribute to its generation (e.g., through environmental sensor data).

**IV. Implementation Notes:**

*   Privacy is critical. Implement robust privacy controls and obtain explicit user consent for audio monitoring.
*   Consider the computational cost of continuous audio analysis. Optimize the algorithms for real-time performance.
*   Experiment with different weighting functions and blending strategies to achieve optimal ASR accuracy in noisy environments.
*   Develop a robust error handling mechanism to gracefully handle unexpected audio events or corrupted noise profiles.
