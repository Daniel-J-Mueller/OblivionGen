## Address Space Partitioning with Dynamic Granularity

**Concept:** Expand the address decoding concept to support dynamically adjustable address space partitioning granularity. Instead of fixed region sizes, allow the decoder to operate with variable-sized regions, defined at runtime. This allows for more flexible memory allocation and security features.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   **Granularity Control Unit (GCU):** A dedicated hardware module that receives a "granularity factor" input. This factor determines the size of the address space regions the decoder manages.  The GCU translates this factor into control signals for the shifting hardware and combinatorial logic.
    *   **Variable Shift Module (VSM):**  A modified shifting hardware module capable of performing shifts of varying lengths, determined by the GCU.  This replaces the fixed multi-bit shift. The VSM utilizes a cascaded series of multiplexers.
    *   **Dynamic Mask Generator (DMG):** The VSM feeds into the DMG which generates the mask signal.
    *   **Address Comparator Array (ACA):** Instead of a single combinatorial logic block, employ an array of smaller comparators. This increases parallelism and speeds up the decoding process.

*   **Input Signals:**
    *   **Transaction Address:** The address to be decoded.
    *   **Base Address:** The starting address of the region.
    *   **Granularity Factor:** A digital value that defines the size of the address regions. This could be a logarithmic scale.
    *   **Region ID:**  An identifier for the address region.  This allows for managing multiple regions with different granularity levels.

*   **Output Signals:**
    *   **Region Hit Indicator:** A signal indicating if the transaction address falls within the specified region.
    *   **Region ID Match:** A signal indicating if the Region ID matches the active region.

*   **Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
function decodeAddress(transactionAddress, baseAddress, granularityFactor, regionID):
  // Calculate region size based on granularity factor
  regionSize = 2 ^ granularityFactor

  // Calculate upper bound of region
  regionUpperBound = baseAddress + regionSize

  // Check if transaction address falls within the region
  if (transactionAddress >= baseAddress AND transactionAddress < regionUpperBound):
    regionHitIndicator = TRUE
  else:
    regionHitIndicator = FALSE

  //Check if region ID matches the active region
  if (currentRegionID == regionID):
    regionIDMatch = TRUE
  else:
    regionIDMatch = FALSE

  return regionHitIndicator, regionIDMatch
```

*   **Operation:** The GCU receives the granularity factor and region ID. It configures the VSM to shift the constant by the appropriate number of bits, creating a mask tailored to the desired region size. The ACA compares the transaction address with the base address and the regionâ€™s upper bound.  The outputs of the ACA, combined with the mask, produce the Region Hit Indicator and Region ID Match.

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Fine-Grained Memory Protection:** Dynamically adjust region sizes for specific security requirements.
    *   **Virtual Memory Management:** Implement more flexible virtual memory mapping.
    *   **Hardware Acceleration:** Assign different regions to different hardware accelerators.
    *   **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Dynamically allocate memory resources based on application needs.
