## Aerial Vehicle Power System - Multi-Stage Load Balancing & Predictive Current Control

**Concept:** Extend the multi-stage switching concept presented in the patent to encompass not just initial inrush current suppression, but *dynamic* load balancing and predictive current control for enhanced efficiency and safety in aerial vehicles.  Instead of just two stages (initial resistance, final low resistance), implement a variable, multi-stage resistive network that adjusts *in real-time* based on predictive algorithms and sensor data, actively distributing load across multiple parallel power paths.

**Specs:**

*   **System Architecture:** A modular power distribution unit (PDU) integrated into the aerial vehicle's frame. The PDU comprises:
    *   A primary power input from the battery.
    *   A microcontroller unit (MCU) with integrated ADC and PWM capabilities.
    *   An array of digitally controlled resistive elements (e.g., MOSFETs acting as variable resistors) forming a dynamically configurable resistive network. Each resistive element corresponds to a specific parallel power path to the load.
    *   Current sensors on each parallel path.
    *   Voltage sensors on the input and load sides.
    *   An inertial measurement unit (IMU) providing flight dynamics data.
    *   A flight controller interface (e.g., UART, CAN) for receiving command and telemetry data.
*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Startup/Inrush Suppression:**  Initial state with high overall resistance, gradually decreasing as the system stabilizes.
    *   **Cruise/Normal Operation:**  Dynamic load balancing based on real-time current draw and predictive algorithms.
    *   **High-Demand/Maneuver Mode:**  Proactive distribution of current across all available paths to maximize power delivery during aggressive maneuvers.
    *   **Fault Tolerance/Redundancy:**  Automatic isolation of faulty paths and redistribution of load to functioning paths.
*   **Predictive Algorithm:**
    *   A machine learning model (trained on historical flight data and system telemetry) predicts the vehicle's current demand based on:
        *   Flight controller commands (throttle, pitch, roll, yaw).
        *   IMU data (acceleration, angular velocity).
        *   Battery state of charge (SOC) and health (SOH).
        *   Environmental factors (wind speed, temperature).
    *   The model outputs a predicted current demand curve for the next 1-2 seconds.
*   **Control Logic (Pseudocode):**

```pseudocode
// Main Control Loop
while (true) {
  // Read sensor data
  current_readings = read_current_sensors();
  voltage_input = read_input_voltage();
  voltage_load = read_load_voltage();
  imu_data = read_imu_data();
  flight_commands = read_flight_commands();

  // Run predictive model
  predicted_current = predict_current(flight_commands, imu_data);

  // Calculate desired resistive network configuration
  desired_resistance = calculate_resistance(predicted_current, voltage_input, voltage_load);
  resistance_per_path = desired_resistance / num_paths;

  // Adjust resistive elements on each path
  for (i = 0; i < num_paths; i++) {
    set_resistance(i, resistance_per_path);
  }

  // Monitor for fault conditions
  for (i = 0; i < num_paths; i++) {
    if (current[i] > threshold) {
      isolate_path(i); // Disable faulty path
      redistribute_load(); // Rebalance across remaining paths
    }
  }

  delay(10ms); // Control loop frequency
}
```

*   **Materials:** High-conductivity copper traces, low-resistance MOSFETs, thermally conductive potting compound, lightweight aluminum housing.
*   **Communication:** A dedicated communication channel to the flight controller for reporting system status, fault conditions, and optimized power delivery recommendations.
