## Adaptive Predictive Maintenance System with Digital Twin Integration

**Concept:** Augment the existing system with a predictive maintenance capability leveraging digital twin technology and real-time anomaly detection. This moves beyond simply *requesting* service from electromechanical systems to *anticipating* failures and preemptively addressing them.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Digital Twin Creation:** Each electromechanical system will have a corresponding digital twin—a virtual representation mirroring its real-world counterpart.  The twin will be populated with:
    *   CAD models/engineering schematics.
    *   Historical performance data (from the existing service request/reply system).
    *   Real-time sensor data (temperature, vibration, current draw, etc. – requiring sensor retrofits or integration where not present).
    *   Material properties and degradation models.
*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:** A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM neural network, Isolation Forest) trained on historical data *and* simulated data from the digital twins. This engine will:
    *   Monitor real-time sensor data streams.
    *   Compare observed data to expected behavior (as predicted by the digital twin).
    *   Flag anomalies—deviations exceeding a defined threshold.  Thresholds will be dynamically adjusted based on system operating conditions and learned patterns.
*   **Predictive Failure Modeling:** Utilize the digital twins to simulate component degradation under various operating conditions.  This allows for the prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) for critical components.
*   **Automated Service Request Generation:**  Based on RUL predictions and anomaly detection, the system will automatically generate service requests *before* failures occur.  Requests will include:
    *   Component identification.
    *   Recommended maintenance procedure.
    *   Required parts.
    *   Estimated downtime.
*   **Service Request Prioritization:**  Requests will be prioritized based on:
    *   Severity of the predicted failure.
    *   Impact on overall system operation.
    *   Availability of resources.
*   **Closed-Loop Learning:**  Maintenance data (e.g., repair logs, replaced components) will be fed back into the anomaly detection engine and digital twin to improve prediction accuracy over time.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Engine):**

```
// Input: Real-time sensor data stream
// Output: Anomaly score

function detectAnomaly(sensorData):
  // 1. Data Preprocessing: Clean, normalize, and format sensor data
  processedData = preprocess(sensorData)

  // 2. Digital Twin Prediction: Predict expected sensor values using the digital twin
  predictedValues = digitalTwin.predict(processedData)

  // 3. Calculate Error: Measure the difference between observed and predicted values
  error = calculateError(processedData, predictedValues)

  // 4. Anomaly Scoring: Assign an anomaly score based on the error magnitude
  anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(error)

  // 5. Thresholding: Compare the anomaly score to a defined threshold
  if anomalyScore > threshold:
    return "Anomaly Detected"
  else:
    return "Normal Operation"
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Edge computing devices for real-time data processing and anomaly detection.
*   High-bandwidth network connectivity for data transmission.
*   Retrofit sensors for systems lacking comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Digital twin modeling software.
*   Machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Data visualization and reporting tools.
*   Integration with existing service request system.
