## Dynamic Proximity-Based Service Bundling

**Concept:** Expand the waiting list functionality to proactively bundle services from geographically proximal merchants *before* a user even joins a waitlist, creating pre-emptive value and potentially reducing wait times via incentivized shifting.

**Specifications:**

**1. Geo-Fencing and Predictive Modeling:**

*   **Data Sources:** Utilize real-time user location data (with explicit consent, obviously), historical wait times for various services, merchant service capacities, and local event schedules.
*   **Algorithm:** A predictive algorithm analyzes user proximity to multiple merchants offering *related* services. Relatedness is defined by a configurable taxonomy (e.g., "coffee shop" and "bakery" are related, "auto repair" and "florist" are not).
*   **Bundling Logic:** When a user enters a defined proximity zone (adjustable sensitivity), the system generates potential service bundles.  These bundles combine a "primary" service (the service the user might be waiting for) with "secondary" services offered by nearby merchants.  Bundle desirability is scored based on predicted user preference (see section 4).

**2. Dynamic Bundle Presentation:**

*   **Pre-emptive Offers:** *Before* the user initiates a waitlist request, present a dynamic "bundle offer" via the user device.  This offer could be a pop-up notification, a banner within a dedicated app, or a targeted advertisement.
*   **Offer Components:** The offer details:
    *   The primary service and estimated wait time.
    *   The secondary service(s) and associated discounts/benefits.
    *   A clear statement of the total value proposition (e.g., "Skip the 30-minute wait at [primary merchant] and get 20% off a pastry at [secondary merchant]!").
*   **Acceptance/Rejection:** The user can immediately accept the bundle offer (automatically joining the waitlist at the primary merchant and receiving the secondary service benefit) or reject it.

**3. Waitlist Prioritization & Shifting:**

*   **Bundle Incentive:** Users who accept bundle offers are given a slightly higher priority in the primary merchant's waitlist (configurable weighting).
*   **Waitlist Shifting:** The system encourages users already on the waitlist to accept bundle offers by offering additional incentives (e.g., a larger discount on the secondary service, a complimentary item). If a user accepts a bundle offer, their position in the waitlist is *slightly* lowered, effectively shifting them towards an earlier seating/service time.
*   **Dynamic Price Adjustment:**  Implement a dynamic pricing model for secondary service benefits. The value of the benefit (discount, complimentary item) can be adjusted based on real-time demand, waitlist length, and user profile.

**4. User Preference Engine:**

*   **Data Collection:** Gather user preference data through various channels:
    *   Explicit ratings/reviews of services.
    *   Purchase history.
    *   Location history (pattern analysis – e.g., frequenting coffee shops in the morning).
    *   Social media integration (with user consent).
*   **Preference Modeling:**  Employ machine learning algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering) to build a user preference profile. This profile is used to personalize bundle offers and maximize acceptance rates.
*   **Real-time Adaptation:** Continuously update the user preference profile based on new data and user interactions.



**Pseudocode (Bundle Offer Generation):**

```
function generateBundleOffer(userLocation, userProfile) {
  nearbyMerchants = findNearbyMerchants(userLocation);
  primaryServices = findPrimaryServices(nearbyMerchants, userProfile); // Services user likely wants
  secondaryServices = findRelatedSecondaryServices(primaryServices, userProfile);

  bundleOffers = [];
  for (primaryService in primaryServices) {
    for (secondaryService in secondaryServices) {
      bundle = {
        primaryMerchant: primaryService.merchant,
        primaryService: primaryService.service,
        secondaryMerchant: secondaryService.merchant,
        secondaryService: secondaryService.service,
        estimatedWaitTime: getEstimatedWaitTime(primaryService.merchant, primaryService.service),
        discount: calculateDiscount(secondaryService.merchant, secondaryService.service, userProfile),
        bundleScore: calculateBundleScore(primaryService, secondaryService, userProfile)
      };
      bundleOffers.push(bundle);
    }
  }

  // Sort bundleOffers by bundleScore (highest score first)
  sortedBundleOffers = sortBundleOffers(bundleOffers);

  return sortedBundleOffers;
}
```

This system moves beyond simply adding users to a waitlist and proactively creates value by incentivizing them to consider alternative options and reducing overall wait times. It’s a win-win for both users and merchants.
