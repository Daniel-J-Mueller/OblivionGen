**Dynamic Product Storytelling via Multi-Modal Data Fusion**

**Concept:** Expand the user profiling beyond purchase history to create dynamic, personalized “product stories” presented *within* the shopping experience. These stories leverage not just what a user *buys*, but how they *interact* with products – dwell time on images, zoom levels, scrolling behavior, even micro-expressions captured via device cameras (with explicit user permission).

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Ingestion Layer:**
    *   **Purchase History:** As defined in the patent.
    *   **Visual Engagement Tracking:**  Monitor dwell time, zoom, pan, and region-of-interest on product images/videos. Track scrolling speed/patterns when viewing product details.
    *   **Micro-Expression Analysis (Optional):**  Utilize device camera (with user opt-in) to detect subtle facial expressions indicative of interest, confusion, or aversion.  Data is processed *locally* on the device for privacy; only aggregated sentiment scores are transmitted.
    *   **Textual Interaction:**  Monitor search queries, product review reads, and chatbot interactions. Analyze sentiment and keywords.
    *   **Environmental Data (Optional):** If the device has access to location data (with user permission), infer contextual information (e.g., weather, time of day) to further refine the story.

2.  **Data Fusion & Story Engine:**
    *   **Behavioral Scoring:** Assign weights to each data point (purchase, dwell time, expression, query, etc.).  Weights are adjusted dynamically based on user feedback and A/B testing.
    *   **Affinity Clusters:**  Refine the existing affinity/aversion clustering from the patent. Create more granular clusters based on *why* users like or dislike products, not just *what* they buy.
    *   **Narrative Generation:**  Based on the behavioral scores and cluster membership, generate a short, personalized "product story" highlighting relevant attributes and benefits.  Example: “Based on your interest in sustainable materials and your recent purchases of outdoor gear, you might appreciate this new line of eco-friendly hiking boots.”
    *   **Multi-Modal Presentation:** Display the story using a combination of text, images, and short videos. Use animations and visual cues to draw attention to key features.

3.  **Dynamic Interface Integration:**
    *   **Contextual Display:** Show the product story at relevant moments within the shopping experience (e.g., when the user is browsing a related product category, after they’ve added an item to their cart, or when they return to the site after a period of inactivity).
    *   **Interactive Elements:** Allow users to provide feedback on the story (e.g., "Helpful," "Not Relevant," "Show me more like this"). Use this feedback to refine the behavioral scoring and narrative generation.
    *   **Personalized Recommendations:**  Integrate the story with the existing recommendation engine to suggest products that align with the user's inferred needs and preferences.

**Pseudocode (Story Generation):**

```
function generateProductStory(userID, productID) {
  userProfile = getUserProfile(userID);
  productAttributes = getProductAttributes(productID);
  affinityCluster = getUserAffinityCluster(userID);

  behavioralScore = calculateBehavioralScore(userID, productAttributes, affinityCluster);

  if (behavioralScore > threshold) {
    storyText = generateStoryText(productAttributes, affinityCluster, behavioralScore);
    storyImage = selectStoryImage(productAttributes);
    return {text: storyText, image: storyImage};
  } else {
    return null; // No story to display
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simply identifying what users like/dislike, to understanding *why*, and then communicating that understanding *to the user* in a dynamic, engaging way.  The multi-modal data fusion and personalized storytelling create a more immersive and effective shopping experience.  It reframes the patent’s focus on assigning products, to creating a dialogue *with* the user based on observed behavior.
