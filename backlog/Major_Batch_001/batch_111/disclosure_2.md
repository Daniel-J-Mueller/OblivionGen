## Dynamic Focus Region Enhancement & Predictive Color Grading

**Concept:** Extend the existing color adjustment capabilities to incorporate a dynamic focus region and predictive color grading based on object tracking and scene understanding. The system will not just adjust color, but *anticipate* where the user’s attention will be and proactively enhance that region for a more immersive experience.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-resolution multi-camera array (as per base patent)
*   Dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for real-time object tracking and scene analysis.
*   Increased RAM capacity (minimum 32GB) for buffering high-resolution video streams and NPU processing.
*   Fast storage (NVMe SSD) for storing processed video data and model parameters.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Object Tracking Module:** Utilizing a combination of deep learning models (e.g., YOLO, SSD) and Kalman filtering to track multiple objects within the stitched panoramic video. Outputs bounding box coordinates, object class, and confidence score.
*   **Saliency Map Generator:**  A neural network trained to predict human visual attention.  Input is the stitched video frame; output is a saliency map highlighting regions likely to attract the viewer’s gaze.
*   **Dynamic Focus Region Selector:**  Combines output from Object Tracking Module and Saliency Map Generator. Prioritizes objects with high confidence scores *and* high saliency. Defines a “focus region” encompassing these elements.
*   **Predictive Color Grading Engine:**  This is the core innovation.
    *   **Scene Understanding:** A deep learning model (e.g., a convolutional neural network trained on a large dataset of scenes) analyzes the video frame to determine the scene type (e.g., outdoor landscape, indoor portrait, action sequence).
    *   **Grading Profile Selection:** Based on scene understanding, the engine selects a pre-defined color grading profile (e.g., vibrant for landscapes, cinematic for portraits, high contrast for action).
    *   **Local Adjustment Module:**  This module adjusts color parameters *locally* within the focus region.  It goes beyond simple contrast/brightness adjustments and includes:
        *   **Color Harmony:** Adjusts color tones to create a more visually pleasing composition.
        *   **Dynamic Range Compression:**  Enhances detail in both highlights and shadows.
        *   **Selective Saturation:**  Boosts saturation in the focus region while maintaining natural colors elsewhere.
*   **Blending & Stitching Enhancement Module:** Integrates color adjustments seamlessly into the existing stitching algorithm. Uses advanced blending techniques (e.g., multi-band blending) to minimize artifacts and ensure smooth transitions between cameras.
*    **User Customization Interface:** Allows users to adjust parameters such as focus region size, grading profile intensity, and custom color palettes.

**III. Pseudocode (Predictive Color Grading Engine):**

```
function PredictiveColorGrade(frame, object_data, scene_type):

  // 1. Select Grading Profile
  profile = SelectGradingProfile(scene_type)

  // 2. Determine Focus Region
  focus_region = DefineFocusRegion(frame, object_data)

  // 3. Local Adjustment
  for each pixel in focus_region:
    // Apply color transformations based on profile
    pixel.color = ApplyColorTransform(pixel.color, profile)

  // 4. Global Adjustment (subtle adjustments to the entire frame)
  ApplyGlobalColorCorrection(frame, profile)

  return frame
```

**IV.  Workflow:**

1.  Multi-camera array captures video data.
2.  Video data is stitched together.
3.  Object Tracking Module identifies and tracks objects.
4.  Saliency Map Generator predicts visual attention.
5.  Dynamic Focus Region Selector defines the focus region.
6.  Predictive Color Grading Engine adjusts color locally within the focus region and globally across the frame.
7.  Blending & Stitching Enhancement Module integrates color adjustments seamlessly.
8.  Output: Enhanced panoramic video with dynamic focus and improved visual appeal.
