## Dynamic Network Topology Reconstruction & Predictive Failure Mitigation

**Concept:** Extend the link health scoring beyond individual link assessment to create a dynamic, reconstructed network topology map coupled with predictive failure analysis. This goes beyond simply identifying a failing link; it anticipates cascading failures based on topology and inter-link dependencies.

**Specs:**

*   **Topology Discovery Agent:** Deployable software agents on each network asset (servers, switches, routers). These agents periodically probe and map direct connections, creating a constantly updated network topology graph.  Data includes link latency, bandwidth, and initial health scores.
*   **Dependency Mapping:** The system analyzes the topology graph to identify critical dependencies.  For example, if server A relies on switch B, and switch B relies on link C, the system establishes a dependency chain.
*   **Predictive Failure Model:** A machine learning model trained on historical link health data, topology information, and dependency chains. This model predicts the probability of failure for *not just* individual links, but for entire dependency chains.  Key input features:
    *   Current link health scores
    *   Historical link health trends (rate of degradation)
    *   Topology metrics (link centrality, path length)
    *   Dependency chain length and criticality
*   **Cascading Failure Simulation:**  The system simulates the impact of individual link failures on the network topology. This helps identify single points of failure and predict the scope of potential outages. The simulation accounts for dynamic routing protocols and failover mechanisms.
*   **Proactive Remediation Engine:**  Based on the predictive failure model and simulation results, the system triggers proactive remediation actions *before* failures occur. Examples:
    *   Traffic rerouting:  Shifting traffic away from predicted failing links.
    *   Resource pre-provisioning:  Allocating additional bandwidth or compute resources to mitigate potential congestion.
    *   Automated failover testing:  Initiating failover tests to verify the effectiveness of redundancy mechanisms.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** The failure threshold isn't static. The system dynamically adjusts thresholds based on network load, time of day, and historical data. During peak hours, the threshold might be higher to avoid false positives.
*   **Visualization Interface:**  A graphical interface that displays the network topology, link health scores, predicted failure probabilities, and recommended remediation actions.  Color-coding is used to highlight critical links and potential failure points.

**Pseudocode (Remediation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION ProactiveRemediation()
  FOREACH Link IN NetworkTopology
    IF PredictiveFailureProbability(Link) > AdaptiveThreshold()
      // Identify affected services/applications
      AffectedServices = IdentifyServicesUsingLink(Link)

      // Determine best remediation strategy
      RemediationStrategy = SelectBestStrategy(AffectedServices, Link)

      // Execute remediation
      IF RemediationStrategy == "TrafficRerouting"
        RerouteTraffic(Link)
      ELSE IF RemediationStrategy == "ResourcePreProvisioning"
        ProvisionResources(Link)
      ELSE IF RemediationStrategy == "FailoverTest"
        RunFailoverTest(Link)
      ENDIF

      // Log action and monitor impact
      LogRemediationAction(Link)
      MonitorImpact(Link)
    ENDIF
  ENDFOREACH
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **NetworkTopology:** Graph data structure (nodes = network assets, edges = links)
*   **LinkHealthScore:**  Float value (0.0 - 1.0) representing link health.
*   **DependencyChain:** List of linked network assets.
*   **RemediationAction:** Enumeration (TrafficRerouting, ResourcePreProvisioning, FailoverTest)
