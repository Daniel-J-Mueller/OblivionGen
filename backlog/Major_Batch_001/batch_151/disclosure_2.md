## Adaptive Prefetching based on Predicted User Attention

**Specification:** Implement a system that predicts user attention levels during media consumption and prefetches content fragments accordingly, adjusting prefetch rate *before* buffering issues arise, rather than reactively.

**Core Concept:**  The existing patent focuses on *retrieval* rate matching playback. This builds on that by anticipating *need* based on predicted attention, dynamically adjusting prefetch priority and quantity. If the system detects waning attention (eyes off screen, audio muted, device movement), it reduces prefetching, conserving bandwidth. If it anticipates increased engagement (e.g., fast-paced scene change, interactive element), it aggressively prefetches.

**Components:**

1.  **Attention Prediction Module:** 
    *   **Input:** Video/Audio features (scene changes, audio complexity, motion vectors), User device sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, camera – gaze tracking if available, microphone – ambient sound analysis),  Historical user interaction data (pause/play patterns, rewind/fast-forward, volume adjustments, content completion rates).
    *   **Processing:**  A multi-layered neural network trained to predict a continuous “attention score” (0-1) representing the probability of active user engagement.  Separate models for audio and video, combined with weighting based on content type (e.g., podcast vs. action movie).  Recurrent layers to capture temporal dependencies.
    *   **Output:**  Predicted Attention Score (0-1) with a time horizon (e.g., 5-10 seconds).

2.  **Prefetch Prioritization Engine:**
    *   **Input:**  Predicted Attention Score, Current buffer level, Fragment size, Fragment priority (determined by content sequence - e.g., key scene vs. background transition), Available bandwidth.
    *   **Processing:**  A rule-based system combined with a reinforcement learning agent.
        *   **Rule-Based:** If attention score > 0.8 and buffer < 20%, increase prefetch rate by 2x. If attention score < 0.2 and buffer > 80%, reduce prefetch rate by 0.5x.
        *   **Reinforcement Learning:**  An agent trained to optimize prefetch decisions based on rewards for uninterrupted playback and penalties for excessive bandwidth usage.  State space includes attention score, buffer level, and available bandwidth.  Action space includes prefetch rate adjustment (e.g., -2x, -1x, 0x, 1x, 2x).
    *   **Output:**  Prefetch Rate Adjustment Factor (float).

3.  **Adaptive Prefetch Scheduler:**
    *   **Input:**  Prefetch Rate Adjustment Factor, Fragment Priority List (generated from content metadata), Available Bandwidth.
    *   **Processing:**  Dynamically adjusts the order and rate at which content fragments are requested from the origin server.  Prioritizes high-priority fragments and adjusts the prefetch rate based on the calculated adjustment factor.  Implements a “graceful degradation” strategy – if bandwidth is severely limited, prioritizes the *most essential* fragments for continuous playback, even if it means lower quality.
    *   **Output:**  Prefetch Request Queue.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Prefetch Scheduler):**

```
function schedule_prefetch(prefetch_queue, fragment_priority_list, adjustment_factor, available_bandwidth) {

  // Apply adjustment factor to fragment request rate
  target_rate = base_prefetch_rate * adjustment_factor;

  // Cap rate based on available bandwidth
  actual_rate = min(target_rate, available_bandwidth);

  // Sort fragment priority list (high to low)
  sorted_fragments = sort(fragment_priority_list, descending);

  // Iterate through sorted fragments
  for each fragment in sorted_fragments {
    if (fragment is not already in prefetch queue) {
        add fragment to prefetch queue
        request fragment from origin server at actual_rate
    }
  }

  return prefetch queue
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced buffering interruptions.
*   Optimized bandwidth usage.
*   Improved user experience.
*   Personalized media delivery based on predicted engagement.
*   Potential for integration with other intelligent media features (e.g., dynamic quality adjustment).
