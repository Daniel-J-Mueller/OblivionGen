## Dynamic Acoustic-Optical Projection System

**Core Concept:** Integrate the lighting assembly not just for visual feedback, but as an active component in directional audio projection, creating localized sound "sweet spots" for individual users.

**Specifications:**

*   **Substrate:** Flexible OLED array embedded within a multi-layer PCB. Dimensions: 150mm x 75mm x 3mm.
*   **Lighting Elements:** Micro-LED array, individually addressable, with peak luminance of 1000 nits. Pixel pitch: 0.5mm. Integrated diffraction gratings patterned onto each micro-LED surface.
*   **Microphone Array:** Circular array of 8 MEMS microphones, beamforming capable, with noise cancellation algorithms. Integrated within the substrate.
*   **Reflector:** Concave, multi-faceted reflector constructed from a highly polished, optically clear polymer.  Surface treatment to maximize reflectivity across a wide spectrum (visible light & ultrasound).
*   **Light Guide:**  Segmented, transparent acrylic waveguide forming a curved "sound bar" profile. Internal acoustic damping material.
*   **Acoustic Transducers:**  Piezoelectric transducers bonded to the rear surface of the light guide, aligned with each segment.
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded ARM Cortex-A72 processor with dedicated DSP for real-time audio/visual processing.
*   **Power:** USB-C Power Delivery (5V/3A).

**Functional Description:**

1.  **Audio Input:** Microphone array captures user voice commands or audio input.
2.  **Spatial Audio Processing:** DSP analyzes the audio signal. This analysis determines the direction and distance of the sound source, and identifies individual voices in a multi-user scenario.
3.  **Light Modulation:** Based on the spatial analysis, the micro-LED array is dynamically modulated.  The diffraction gratings on each LED create interference patterns. These patterns shape the light emitted.  The intensity and direction of the light are *synchronized* with the audio signal.
4.  **Acoustic Beamforming:**  The modulated light strikes the concave reflector, creating a focused beam.  This beam excites the piezoelectric transducers bonded to the light guide.  The transducers generate ultrasound waves.
5.  **Localized Sound Projection:** The ultrasound waves interfere constructively in specific zones within the room. This creates a localized “sweet spot” of audible sound *directed towards the user’s ears*.  The light patterns visually emphasize this focused zone. The light acts as a visual cue for the directed audio.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Microphone input
audio_signal = capture_audio()

// Spatial audio analysis
source_direction, source_distance = analyze_audio(audio_signal)

// Calculate light pattern for diffraction
light_pattern = generate_diffraction_pattern(source_direction, source_distance)

// Set Micro-LED array
set_microled_pattern(light_pattern)

// Generate ultrasound signal
ultrasound_signal = generate_ultrasound(source_direction, source_distance)

// Activate piezo transducers
activate_transducers(ultrasound_signal)
```

**Novelty:**  Combines visual feedback with *directional* audio projection using light and ultrasound. The system dynamically adjusts the light and ultrasound to create highly localized sound zones.  This would move beyond simple notifications to creating personalized audio experiences. The light isn't *just* feedback, it's an integral part of the sound projection system.
