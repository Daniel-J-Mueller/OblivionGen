## Dynamic Contextual Overlay for Physical Spaces

**Concept:** Extend the patent's concept of restricted access to information by layering it onto physical spaces using augmented reality. Instead of modifying presented *digital* information, the system modifies the userâ€™s perception of the *physical* environment by displaying restricted-access contextual data.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** AR-capable glasses or a mobile device with AR functionality (camera, depth sensor, IMU).
*   **Software Core:** A client application running on the AR device, communicating with a server system.
*   **Server Components:**
    *   **Space Mapping Database:** A database containing 3D models of physical spaces (offices, warehouses, factories, retail stores). This could be built from scans, blueprints, or manual modeling.
    *   **Restricted Data Layer:**  Associated with each mapped space, this layer holds restricted-access information relevant to authorized users (e.g., maintenance schedules, security protocols, inventory levels, confidential project details visible only on specific equipment).
    *   **User Authentication & Authorization:** System to verify user identity and permissions based on roles and groups.
*   **Operation:**
    1.  **Environment Scan:** User wears AR glasses. The device scans the surrounding environment and attempts to match it to a known space within the Space Mapping Database.
    2.  **User Authentication:** User authenticates with the system (biometrics, password, etc.).
    3.  **Permission Check:** The server verifies the user's permissions for the currently identified space.
    4.  **Data Overlay:** Based on user permissions, the system dynamically overlays restricted-access data onto the user's view of the physical environment.
        *   **Visual Indicators:** Highlights specific equipment with color-coded status indicators (e.g., green = operational, yellow = warning, red = critical).
        *   **Contextual Information:** Displays relevant data when the user looks at specific objects (e.g., inventory count on a shelf, maintenance schedule for a machine, security clearance levels for a room).
        *   **Augmented Instructions:** Projects step-by-step instructions onto physical equipment for maintenance or repair tasks.
        *   **Spatial Audio:** Provides audio cues related to specific objects or events within the environment.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// AR Device Code
function onEnvironmentScanComplete(environmentModel) {
    sendToServer(environmentModel, userAuthenticationToken);
}

function onServerResponse(restrictedData) {
    if (restrictedData) {
        for (each object in restrictedData) {
            if (object.isVisibleInEnvironment) {
                displayObjectData(object.data, object.location); //Augmented Reality Display
            }
        }
    }
}

//Server Side Code
function processEnvironmentScan(environmentModel, userToken) {
    user = authenticateUser(userToken);
    permissions = getUserPermissions(user);

    restrictedData = getRestrictedDataForEnvironment(environmentModel, permissions);

    sendDataToClient(restrictedData);
}
```

**Possible Extensions:**

*   **Real-time Collaboration:** Allow multiple authorized users to see and interact with the same augmented environment, sharing information and collaborating on tasks.
*   **Predictive Maintenance:** Use sensor data from equipment to predict failures and proactively display maintenance instructions to users.
*   **Security Enhancements:** Overlay security zones and access restrictions onto the physical environment, alerting users to potential breaches.
*   **Integration with IoT Devices:** Connect to IoT sensors to display real-time data about environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, air quality) within the augmented environment.
