## Temporal Influence Mapping for Proactive Trend Identification

**Concept:** Extend the reverse temporal graph concept to model *influence* rather than just adoption timing. This allows for proactive identification of emerging trends *before* they reach mainstream adoption.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Sources:**
    *   Item access data (as in the source patent).
    *   Social network data: User connections (followers, friends, etc.)
    *   Content metadata: Tags, categories, descriptions associated with accessed items.
    *   Geographic data: Location of users accessing items (optional, for localized trend detection).

2.  **Graph Construction – Influence Graph:**
    *   Nodes: Users and items.
    *   Edges:
        *   *Adoption Edges:*  As in the source patent, directed from later adopters to earlier adopters. Weighted by the time difference between accesses.
        *   *Influence Edges:*  Directed from users to items *and* from users to other users (based on social network connections). Weighting based on the strength of the social connection. If a user shares/likes/comments on an item, a weighted edge is created from that user to the item. Edges between users are created if they frequently interact (follow each other, comment on each other’s posts, etc.).
        *   *Content Similarity Edges:* Between items, based on metadata similarity (tags, categories, etc.). Weighted by the degree of similarity.

3.  **Temporal Weighting Function:**
    *   All edges have a temporal decay factor. The further in time an action occurred, the lower its weight. This prevents old data from dominating the analysis.
    *   Formula: `Weight = BaseWeight * e^(-k * Δt)`
        *   `BaseWeight`: Initial weight of the edge.
        *   `k`: Decay constant (tunable parameter).
        *   `Δt`: Time difference between events.

4.  **Centrality Measures – Enhanced Algorithm:**
    *   Combine PageRank (or similar algorithm) with a new metric: *Influence Score*.
    *   *Influence Score* is calculated for each user based on:
        *   Their PageRank score in the combined graph.
        *   The aggregate *Influence Score* of the items they have interacted with.
        *   The number of users they directly influence (out-degree of influence edges).

5.  **Trend Detection Algorithm:**
    *   Monitor the *Influence Score* of items over time.
    *   Identify “Emerging Items” as those with rapidly increasing *Influence Score*, but still relatively low overall adoption.
    *   Utilize a change point detection algorithm (e.g., CUSUM) to identify significant shifts in *Influence Score*.
    *   Cluster emerging items based on content similarity to identify potential new trends.

6.  **Proactive Recommendation System:**
    *   Recommend emerging items to users *before* they become mainstream.
    *   Target recommendations to users with high *Influence Score* who are likely to become early adopters and spread the trend.
    *   Employ a bandit algorithm to optimize recommendation strategies and balance exploration (recommending new items) with exploitation (recommending items with high known success rates).

7.  **System Architecture:**
    *   Real-time data ingestion pipeline for item access, social network, and content metadata.
    *   Distributed graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to store and process the influence graph.
    *   Stream processing engine (e.g., Apache Kafka, Apache Flink) to perform real-time analysis and trend detection.
    *   Machine learning pipeline for training and deploying recommendation models.

**Pseudocode for Trend Detection:**

```
// Initialize graph database with item access, social network, content data
// Every time interval:

// Update influence graph with new item access events, social interactions
graph.update()

// Calculate Influence Score for all users
userScores = calculateInfluenceScores(graph)

// Identify emerging items based on Influence Score change
emergingItems = detectEmergingItems(graph, userScores)

// Cluster emerging items to identify potential new trends
trends = clusterEmergingItems(emergingItems)

// Recommend emerging items to targeted users
recommend(trends, userScores)
```
