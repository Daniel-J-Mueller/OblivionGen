## Adaptive Content Sandboxing with Behavioral Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the existing virtual machine-based content analysis to incorporate dynamic behavioral profiling and adaptive sandboxing levels. Instead of relying solely on DOM comparisons and static analysis, the system actively learns the expected behavior of content and adjusts the sandbox restrictions accordingly.

**Specification:**

**1. Behavioral Baseline Generation:**

*   **Phase 1 (Learning):**  When initially encountering content (e.g., a new advertisement network), the system renders it within the virtual machine under minimal restrictions. During this phase, all actions (network requests, DOM manipulations, cookie access, script execution) are logged and analyzed. This establishes a "behavioral baseline" – a statistical profile of typical actions.
*   **Data Points:** Log the following:
    *   API calls made by scripts (e.g., `XMLHttpRequest`, `localStorage`)
    *   Network domains contacted
    *   Frequency of DOM element modifications
    *   Types of events triggered (e.g., clicks, mouseovers)
    *   Cookie read/write operations
*   **Statistical Modeling:** Employ anomaly detection techniques (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to model the expected behavior based on the collected data.  Establish thresholds for each data point to define ‘normal’ behavior.

**2. Dynamic Sandbox Adjustment:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** As content renders, continuously monitor its actions against the established behavioral baseline.
*   **Anomaly Scoring:** Assign an anomaly score to each action based on its deviation from the baseline. The score is a function of the magnitude of the deviation and the importance of the action (e.g., a network request to a known malicious domain receives a high score).
*   **Sandbox Level Adjustment:**  Based on the accumulated anomaly score, dynamically adjust the sandbox restrictions:
    *   **Low Anomaly Score:** Minimal restrictions – content operates with near-native browser capabilities.
    *   **Medium Anomaly Score:**  Increased restrictions – network access limited to whitelisted domains, stricter JavaScript execution policies, monitoring of sensitive API calls.
    *   **High Anomaly Score:**  Maximum restrictions – content effectively isolated, all actions logged and potentially blocked, alerts generated.

**3. System Components:**

*   **Behavioral Profiler:**  Responsible for learning and maintaining behavioral baselines for different content sources.
*   **Anomaly Detector:**  Continuously monitors content actions and calculates anomaly scores.
*   **Sandbox Controller:**  Dynamically adjusts sandbox restrictions based on anomaly scores.
*   **Virtual Machine Manager:**  Manages the virtual machine environment.
*   **Logging & Alerting:** Records all actions and generates alerts for suspicious behavior.

**4. Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
For each ContentSource:
    Create BehavioralBaseline (empty)

//Real-time Analysis
On Content Render:
    Reset AnomalyScore
    For each Action:
        Calculate Deviation from BehavioralBaseline
        AnomalyScore += Deviation * ActionImportance
        If AnomalyScore > Threshold:
            AdjustSandboxLevel(AnomalyScore)

//AdjustSandboxLevel Function
Function AdjustSandboxLevel(AnomalyScore):
    If AnomalyScore < LowThreshold:
        SandboxLevel = Minimal
    Else If AnomalyScore < HighThreshold:
        SandboxLevel = Medium
    Else:
        SandboxLevel = Maximum
    ApplySandboxLevel(SandboxLevel)
```

**5. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Federated Learning:** Share behavioral profiles across multiple instances of the system to improve accuracy and detect emerging threats.
*   **Explainable AI:** Provide insights into why specific actions were flagged as anomalous.
*   **Automated Baseline Updates:**  Periodically update behavioral baselines to account for legitimate changes in content behavior.
*   **Content Tagging:** Assign risk scores to content sources based on their historical behavior.
