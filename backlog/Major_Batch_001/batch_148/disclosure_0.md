## Personalized Affective Language Modeling for Proactive Assistance

**Specification:** A system integrating real-time affective state detection with personalized language models to proactively offer assistance tailored to the user’s emotional context.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on *what* a user says/does. This builds on that by understanding *how* they say/do it, and anticipating needs based on affective state changes.

**System Components:**

1.  **Multimodal Affect Detection Module:**
    *   **Input:** Audio (speech), Video (facial expressions, body language), Text (message content, sentiment analysis).
    *   **Processing:** Utilizes deep learning models (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) trained on large datasets of affective expression.  Combines data streams via sensor fusion.
    *   **Output:** Real-time estimation of user's affective state (e.g., happiness, sadness, frustration, confusion) represented as a vector of probabilities.

2.  **Dynamic Affective Language Model (DALM):**
    *   **Base Model:** Leverages the personalized language model from the original patent.
    *   **Affect Embedding Layer:** Adds an embedding layer that incorporates the affective state vector from the Affect Detection Module.  This layer learns to associate specific affective states with changes in language usage and predictive probabilities.
    *   **Contextual Gating Mechanism:** Implements a gating mechanism that dynamically weights the contribution of the base language model and the affect embedding layer based on the current context and affective state.  When the user is in a neutral state, the base model dominates.  When an extreme affective state is detected, the affect embedding layer gains more influence.
    *   **Training:**  Continuously trained on user interactions, leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize for user engagement and successful task completion.  Reward signals are based on explicit user feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down) and implicit signals (e.g., task completion time, error rate).

3.  **Proactive Assistance Engine:**
    *   **State Monitoring:** Continuously monitors the user’s affective state and context (e.g., current application, ongoing task, time of day).
    *   **Need Prediction:** Uses the DALM to predict the user’s likely needs based on their affective state and context.  For example, if the user is detected as frustrated while composing an email, the system might proactively suggest relevant phrases or offer assistance with grammar and spelling.
    *   **Action Selection:**  Chooses the most appropriate action to take based on the predicted need and user preferences. Actions could include: providing helpful information, offering assistance with a task, suggesting a break, or initiating a conversation.
    *   **Adaptive Assistance Level:** Dynamically adjusts the level of assistance provided based on user feedback and observed behavior.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Assistance Engine):**

```
loop:
  affect_state = AffectDetectionModule.detect()
  context = SystemContext.get()
  predicted_need = DALM.predict_need(affect_state, context)
  assistance_level = UserPreferences.get_assistance_level()

  if predicted_need != None and assistance_level > 0:
    action = ActionSelector.choose_action(predicted_need, assistance_level)
    execute_action(action)

  wait(100ms)
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply personalizing the language model based on *what* the user says. It integrates affective state detection to predict *why* the user might need assistance and proactively offer help tailored to their emotional context. This offers a more nuanced and empathetic user experience.
