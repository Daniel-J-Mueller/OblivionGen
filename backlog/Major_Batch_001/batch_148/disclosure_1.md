## Adaptive Acoustic Environment Mapping & Personalized Echo Cancellation

**Concept:** Instead of simply disabling/enabling echo cancellation based on wakeword detection, proactively map the acoustic environment and personalize the echo cancellation profile *before* the user even speaks. This moves from reactive to predictive echo control, dramatically improving performance in complex environments.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** Minimum 4 microphones – front, left, right, and top-facing. This allows for 3D sound source localization.
*   **Low-Latency Processor:**  Dedicated processor for real-time signal processing.  Must support parallel processing for the microphone array.
*   **Environmental Sensors:**  Optional: Integrate with room sensors (temperature, humidity) to refine the acoustic model.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Acoustic Mapping Module:**
    *   **Continuous Environment Scan:**  Periodically (e.g., every 5 seconds) emit a short, inaudible (or very low volume) “ping” – a specific frequency sweep.
    *   **Time-of-Flight Analysis:** Analyze the arrival times of the ping's reflections at each microphone to create a 3D map of the room’s surfaces. This map identifies potential echo sources (walls, furniture, windows).
    *   **Reverberation Time (RT60) Calculation:**  Estimate the RT60 for different areas of the room based on the reflected signal data.
    *   **Dynamic Map Updates:**  Continuously update the acoustic map to account for changes in the environment (e.g., someone moving furniture).

*   **User Profile Management:**
    *   **User Identification:**  Utilize voice recognition or other authentication methods to identify the user.
    *   **Personalized Acoustic Profile:**  Store each user’s preferred voice characteristics (tone, volume, speaking rate) and listening preferences.
    *   **Historical Data:** Track the user’s typical locations within the room and the associated acoustic conditions.

*   **Predictive Echo Cancellation Module:**
    *   **Environmental Condition Assessment:** Combine the acoustic map with the user’s location and historical data to predict the likely echo characteristics.
    *   **Adaptive Filter Pre-Configuration:**  Pre-configure the adaptive echo cancellation filter coefficients based on the predicted echo characteristics *before* the user speaks. This significantly reduces the initial convergence time of the echo cancellation algorithm.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Continuously monitor the audio signal and refine the filter coefficients in real-time to adapt to changing conditions.
    *   **Beamforming Integration:** Use beamforming techniques to focus on the user's voice and suppress noise and echoes from other directions.

**3. Pseudocode (Predictive Echo Cancellation Module):**

```pseudocode
//Initialization
Create Acoustic Map object
Create User Profile object

//Main Loop
while (Device is ON) {
    Update Acoustic Map (Periodic Scan)
    Identify User
    Load User Profile

    //Predict Echo Characteristics
    predictedEchoProfile = CalculatePredictedEcho(Acoustic Map, User Profile)

    //Pre-configure Adaptive Filter
    ConfigureAdaptiveFilter(predictedEchoProfile)

    //Process Audio Input
    audioInput = GetAudioInput()
    echoCancelledAudio = ApplyAdaptiveFilter(audioInput)

    //Real-time Adjustment
    MonitorAudioSignal(echoCancelledAudio)
    RefineAdaptiveFilter(based on monitoring data)
}

//Function: CalculatePredictedEcho
function CalculatePredictedEcho(acousticMap, userProfile) {
    location = userProfile.currentLocation
    roomGeometry = acousticMap.getRoomGeometry(location)
    predictedReflectionPoints =  FindPotentialReflectionPoints(roomGeometry)
    predictedEchoDelays = CalculateEchoDelays(predictedReflectionPoints)
    predictedEchoAmplitudes = CalculateEchoAmplitudes(predictedReflectionPoints)
    return {delays: predictedEchoDelays, amplitudes: predictedEchoAmplitudes}
}
```

**4. Advanced Features:**

*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Integrate with other smart home devices (e.g., lights, thermostat) to further refine the acoustic model based on the current context.
*   **Machine Learning:**  Utilize machine learning algorithms to continuously improve the accuracy of the acoustic map and the effectiveness of the echo cancellation algorithm.
*    **Noise Shaping:** Integrate a noise shaping algorithm to mask residual echoes and improve speech intelligibility.
