## Adaptive Biometric Resonance Profiling

**Concept:** Expand the biometric data collection beyond static measurements (heart rate, pupil dilation) to incorporate *resonant frequencies* within the biometric signals. The premise is that duress alters the natural resonant frequencies of physiological systems.  Think of it like a tuning fork – under stress, its tone subtly shifts.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sensor Suite:** Integrated sensor array including:
    *   High-resolution ECG/EMG (electromyography) for detailed muscle and heart electrical activity.
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) for subtle blood volume changes beyond heart rate – capturing micro-vasculature responses.
    *   Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) – assess cerebral blood oxygenation and neural activity patterns.
    *   Contactless Radar/Doppler for minute movement detection (tremors, subtle postural shifts) – integrated into signing surface.

2.  **Resonance Extraction Module:**
    *   Real-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Wavelet analysis on sensor data streams. This extracts dominant frequencies and frequency shifts within each biometric signal.
    *   Adaptive filtering to isolate relevant frequencies, removing noise and artifacts. The filter parameters adjust based on baseline readings and individual biometric profiles.

3.  **Biometric Resonance Profile (BRP) Generation:**
    *   Establish a baseline BRP for each signatory during a relaxed state. This includes dominant frequencies, amplitude ranges, and inter-frequency relationships.
    *   The BRP is a multi-dimensional vector representing the signatory's resonant biometric signature.

4.  **Duress Detection Engine:**
    *   Compare real-time resonance data to the baseline BRP.
    *   Calculate a “Resonance Deviation Score” (RDS) based on the magnitude of frequency shifts, amplitude changes, and altered inter-frequency relationships.
    *   Implement a machine learning model (e.g., anomaly detection algorithm) trained on a diverse dataset of stressed/relaxed biometric data to classify the RDS as indicative of duress.
    *   Weighting parameters for each biometric signal within the RDS calculation are personalized to the signatory based on their individual physiology.

5.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   The duress threshold is not static. It dynamically adjusts based on:
        *   Signatory’s historical RDS data.
        *   Environmental factors (e.g., ambient noise, temperature) measured by integrated sensors.
        *   The criticality of the document being signed (user-defined or automated based on document content).

6.  **Output/Action:**
    *   RDS and confidence level are reported alongside the signature.
    *   If duress is detected above a defined threshold, trigger actions as outlined in the original patent (hide accounts, notify security, etc.).
    *   Generate an "Adaptive Biometric Resonance Report" providing detailed analysis of the signature event for forensic purposes.

**Pseudocode (Duress Detection Engine):**

```
function detectDuress(realtimeData, baselineBRP, realtimeFeatures, historicalData, environmentalData, documentCriticality) {

  // Extract features from realtimeData (FFT, Wavelet) -> realtimeFeatures
  // Calculate deviation from baseline for each feature (realtimeFeatures - baselineBRP)
  deviationScores = calculateDeviation(realtimeFeatures, baselineBRP)

  // Apply weighting based on historical data and environmental factors
  weightedDeviationScores = applyWeighting(deviationScores, historicalData, environmentalData)

  // Calculate overall Duress Score based on weighted deviations and document criticality
  duressScore = calculateDuressScore(weightedDeviationScores, documentCriticality)

  // Classify duress level using trained ML model
  duressLevel = classifyDuress(duressScore, ML_Model)

  return duressLevel
}
```

This system moves beyond simple biometric measurements and aims to capture more nuanced physiological responses indicative of duress through the analysis of resonant frequencies. It allows for a more sensitive and adaptive duress detection system.
