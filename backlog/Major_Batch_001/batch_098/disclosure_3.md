## Dynamic Key Fragmentation with Stochastic Reassembly

**Concept:** Instead of rotating a *single* key, fragment the key into multiple shares. These shares are distributed across hardware security modules (HSMs). Reassemble the key only when needed for an operation, with the reassembly process itself being governed by stochastic processes. This offers a finer-grained control over key exposure and increases the attack surface.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Key Fragmentation Module:**
    *   Input: A cryptographic key (e.g., AES-256).
    *   Process: Splits the key into *n* shares using a Secret Sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing).
    *   Output: *n* key shares.

2.  **Share Distribution Module:**
    *   Input: *n* key shares, a list of *m* HSMs.
    *   Process: Distributes the shares amongst the HSMs. Each HSM receives one or more shares. A mapping of HSM ID to share ID(s) is maintained.
    *   Output: Confirmation of share distribution.

3.  **Reassembly Trigger Module:**
    *   Input: Request for an operation requiring the key.
    *   Process: Generates a stochastically-determined 'reassembly probability'. This is a value between 0 and 1, calculated using a pseudorandom number generator seeded with a unique request ID.
    *   Output: 'Reassemble' flag (True/False) based on the reassembly probability exceeding a threshold (configurable parameter).

4.  **Dynamic Reassembly Orchestrator:**
    *   Input: ‘Reassemble’ flag, HSM ID to Share ID mapping.
    *   Process:
        *   If ‘Reassemble’ flag is True:
            *   Identifies HSMs holding required key shares.
            *   Initiates secure communication channels with those HSMs.
            *   Requests key shares.
            *   Combines shares to reconstruct the full key *only within a secure enclave*.
            *   Performs the cryptographic operation.
            *   Destroys the reconstructed key immediately after operation.
        *   If ‘Reassemble’ flag is False:
            *   Signals operation failure or uses a fallback mechanism (e.g., using a different key, delaying the operation).

5.  **Stochastic Threshold Adjustment Module:**
    *   Input: Current reassembly probability threshold, system load, threat intelligence feeds.
    *   Process: Dynamically adjusts the reassembly probability threshold based on system conditions and perceived threats. This allows for adaptive security levels.
    *   Output: Updated reassembly probability threshold.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Reassembly Orchestrator):**

```
function perform_operation(request):
    reassembly_probability = generate_random_number()
    if reassembly_probability > current_threshold:
        required_hsms = get_hsms_for_key(request.key_id)
        shares = request_shares_from_hsms(required_hsms)
        key = reconstruct_key(shares)
        result = perform_operation_with_key(request, key)
        destroy_key(key)
        return result
    else:
        #Handle failure or fallback
        log_failure("Reassembly probability threshold not met")
        return ERROR_CODE
```

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond simple key rotation to dynamic key *fragmentation and reassembly*, governed by stochastic processes. This introduces uncertainty for potential attackers and significantly increases the complexity of compromise. The adaptive threshold adjustment adds a layer of resilience against evolving threats.
