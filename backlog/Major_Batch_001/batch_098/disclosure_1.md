## Dynamic Sensory Profile Generation & Projection

**Concept:** Expand beyond audio-visual adaptation to include *all* sensory inputs, and introduce predictive, anticipatory adjustment based on user biometrics and environmental analysis. Essentially, create a “sensory bubble” tailored to the content and user state.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sensory Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Inputs:**
    *   Content Identifier (from existing system)
    *   User Biometrics: Heart rate variability, skin conductance, EEG (via wearable sensors – smartwatch, headband, etc.).
    *   Environmental Sensors: Ambient lighting, temperature, humidity, air quality, detected smells (via small, integrated sensors), proximity to surfaces (using ultrasonic or infrared sensors).
    *   User Input:  Existing controller data, eye-tracking data, voice analysis (emotional state detection).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Real-time data streaming from all sensors.
    *   Noise filtering and signal amplification.
    *   Data normalization and feature extraction.
    *   Sensor fusion – combining data streams into a unified sensory profile.

**2. Predictive Sensory Profile Generator:**

*   **Core Algorithm:**  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.  This is trained on a massive dataset of sensory responses to content (similar to existing profile generation, but expanded to *all* sensory modalities).
*   **Training Data:**  Data collected from a large user base, correlating content segments with sensor readings (biometrics, environment, input).  Labeling data with subjective user feedback (e.g., “immersing,” “tense,” “relaxed”) to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Output:**  A time-series prediction of optimal sensory settings for each moment in the content. Settings include:
    *   **Audio:** Volume, equalization, spatialization, dynamic range compression.
    *   **Visual:** Brightness, contrast, color temperature, HDR settings, field of view (if VR/AR).
    *   **Haptic:** Vibration intensity and patterns (controller, chair, vest), temperature (localized cooling/heating).
    *   **Olfactory:** Scent dispersal (using small, controlled scent diffusers).
    *   **Thermal:** Localized temperature adjustments (using thermoelectric modules).

**3. Sensory Projection System:**

*   **Output Devices:**
    *   Smart Speakers (enhanced with spatial audio capabilities).
    *   Smart Lighting (controllable brightness, color, and direction).
    *   Haptic Feedback Controllers/Suits.
    *   Olfactory Diffusers (with a cartridge system for different scents).
    *   Thermoelectric Modules (integrated into chair, vest, or room environment).
    *   AR/VR Headsets (integrated visual and spatial audio adjustments).
*   **Control Logic:**
    *   Real-time adjustment of output devices based on the predictive sensory profile.
    *   Smooth transitions between settings to avoid jarring experiences.
    *   User override options – allowing users to customize settings or disable certain modalities.

**4. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
Loop:
    // Acquire data
    biometrics = getBiometrics()
    environment = getEnvironmentData()
    userInput = getUserInput()
    contentID = getContentID()

    // Generate sensory profile
    sensoryProfile = predictSensoryProfile(contentID, biometrics, environment, userInput)

    // Adjust output devices
    adjustAudio(sensoryProfile.audio)
    adjustLighting(sensoryProfile.visual)
    adjustHaptics(sensoryProfile.haptic)
    adjustOlfactory(sensoryProfile.olfactory)
    adjustThermal(sensoryProfile.thermal)
End Loop
```

**Novelty:** This expands the scope of adaptive presentation beyond audio and visual to encompass *all* sensory modalities, leveraging biometrics and environmental data to create a truly immersive and personalized experience.  The predictive algorithm aims to anticipate user responses and proactively adjust sensory settings, rather than simply reacting to changes in user input.
