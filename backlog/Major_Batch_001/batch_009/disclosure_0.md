## Adaptive Resource Access based on Behavioral Biometrics & Predictive Modeling

**Specification:** A system augmenting credential expiration with real-time behavioral analysis to dynamically adjust access rights *before* and *beyond* scheduled expiration. This goes beyond simply limiting access as time passes; it proactively adapts based on perceived risk.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Sensor Suite:** Captures a wide range of user behaviors:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, pressure)
    *   Mouse/Touchpad movements (speed, acceleration, patterns)
    *   Scroll behavior
    *   Application usage patterns (frequency, duration, sequence)
    *   Network traffic analysis (request patterns, data volumes, geographic locations)
    *   Device posture (orientation, motion, ambient conditions)

2.  **Baseline Profile Builder:** Creates a personalized behavioral baseline for each user using machine learning (specifically, anomaly detection algorithms like autoencoders or isolation forests).  This establishes a "normal" behavior profile.

3.  **Real-Time Anomaly Detector:** Continuously monitors user behavior, comparing it to the established baseline.  Deviation scores are calculated for each behavior category.  These scores represent the likelihood that the current behavior is anomalous.

4.  **Predictive Risk Engine:** This is the core innovation. It uses the deviation scores *and* historical access data (as used in the original patent) to predict the probability of a security breach or compromise.  Crucially, it extends beyond simple access denial.

    *   **Input:**
        *   Deviation scores from the Anomaly Detector
        *   Historical Access Data (as per the patent)
        *   Sensor data indicating security breaches (as per the patent)
        *   Contextual Information: Time of day, location, resource being accessed, user role, network conditions.

    *   **Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – is used to model the temporal dependencies in user behavior and predict the risk score. The LSTM is trained on a large dataset of both legitimate and malicious user activity.

    *   **Output:** A risk score between 0 and 1, representing the probability of a security breach.

5.  **Dynamic Access Controller:** Adjusts access rights based on the risk score. Instead of simply limiting access as the credential expiration nears, it employs a granular system:

    *   **Risk Score < 0.2:** Normal access granted.
    *   **0.2 <= Risk Score < 0.5:** Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) required. The MFA method can be dynamically chosen based on the type of anomaly detected (e.g., biometric challenge for keystroke anomalies, location-based challenge for unexpected login locations).
    *   **0.5 <= Risk Score < 0.8:** Session monitoring is activated. User activity is logged in detail and audited in real-time.  Resource access is limited to read-only mode.
    *   **Risk Score >= 0.8:** Access is immediately blocked, and security alerts are triggered. A full forensic investigation is initiated.

6.  **Adaptive Credential Adjustment:** The system can also *extend* or *shorten* the grace period for credential expiration based on ongoing risk assessment. If a user consistently demonstrates low-risk behavior, the grace period can be extended. Conversely, if a user consistently exhibits anomalous behavior, the grace period can be shortened or even eliminated.



**Pseudocode (Dynamic Access Control):**

```
function adjustAccess(riskScore, accessRequest):
  if riskScore < 0.2:
    return grantAccess(accessRequest)
  else if riskScore < 0.5:
    requireMFA(accessRequest)
    if MFA_successful:
      return grantAccess(accessRequest)
    else:
      denyAccess(accessRequest)
  else if riskScore < 0.8:
    activateSessionMonitoring(accessRequest)
    setAccessMode(accessRequest, "readOnly")
    return grantAccess(accessRequest)
  else:
    blockAccess(accessRequest)
    triggerSecurityAlert()
    initiateForensicInvestigation()
    return denyAccess(accessRequest)

```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Risk Assessment:** Moves beyond reactive access control to anticipate and prevent security breaches.
*   **Granular Access Control:** Provides a much finer level of control than simple access/denial.
*   **Adaptive Credential Management:** Dynamically adjusts credential expiration based on user behavior.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of security breaches.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Variety:**  Dynamically chooses MFA methods.
