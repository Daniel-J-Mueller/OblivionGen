## Dynamic Region Proposal via User Gaze Tracking

**Concept:** Augment the region-of-interest (ROI) definition not just with static anatomical landmarks (waistlines, torso boundaries) but *dynamically* with user gaze data. This allows the system to prioritize image regions the *user* is visually attending to, improving object identification accuracy and creating a more intuitive, personalized experience.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Gaze Tracking Integration:**
    *   Hardware: Integrate with existing eye-tracking hardware (integrated webcam-based or dedicated eye-tracking devices).
    *   Software:  Real-time acquisition of gaze coordinates (x, y) relative to the image frame.
    *   Calibration: Implement a user calibration routine to map gaze coordinates to the image plane, accounting for head pose and individual eye characteristics.

2.  **Dynamic ROI Generation:**
    *   *Gaze-Weighted Regions:* Create initial ROIs (torso, legs as in the patent) but assign a 'gaze weight' to each region. This weight is proportional to the amount of time the user's gaze falls within that region.
    *   *Gaze-Triggered Subdivision:* If gaze dwells within an ROI for a specified duration (e.g., 500ms), subdivide that ROI into smaller regions. This allows for finer-grained analysis of areas of interest. The division pattern (e.g., quad-tree decomposition) should be configurable.
    *   *Gaze-Driven Expansion/Contraction:*  Implement a mechanism to dynamically adjust the size of ROIs based on gaze proximity.  ROIs should expand slightly when the userâ€™s gaze approaches their boundaries, and contract when the gaze moves away.

3.  **Feature Analysis & Classification:**
    *   *Gaze-Weighted Feature Vectors:*  When extracting features from ROIs for classification, weight the features according to the gaze weight of the corresponding region. This emphasizes features from areas the user is actively viewing.
    *   *Attention Maps:* Generate attention maps overlaid on the image, visualizing the regions where the system is focusing its analysis based on gaze data.
    *   *Adaptive Classifier:* Train a classifier (CNN as mentioned in the patent) using gaze-weighted feature vectors.  The classifier should be continuously updated with new gaze data to improve accuracy over time.

4. **Pseudocode (ROI Generation):**

```
function generate_rois(image_data, gaze_data):
    # Initial ROIs (Torso, Legs - as defined in patent)
    rois = [define_torso_roi(image_data), define_legs_roi(image_data)]

    # Calculate gaze weights
    gaze_weights = calculate_gaze_weights(rois, gaze_data)

    # Subdivide ROIs based on dwell time and gaze weight
    for roi in rois:
        if gaze_weights[roi] > threshold_dwell_time:
            subdivide_roi(roi, gaze_data) # uses quadtree or similar

    #Adjust ROI size based on gaze proximity
    for roi in rois:
        roi_size = adjust_roi_size(roi, gaze_data)

    return rois
```

5.  **Output:**  The system outputs not only the identification of objects but also the gaze-weighted ROIs, attention maps, and the confidence level of the object identification.  This provides valuable insights into *why* the system made a particular decision, increasing transparency and trust.
