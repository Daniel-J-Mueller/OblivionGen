## Dynamic Event-Based Item Bundling & Predictive Gifting

**Concept:** Expand the tag/hashtag system to dynamically create and suggest item *bundles* based on predicted life events, moving beyond simple item association. This system anticipates needs *before* a user explicitly searches, functioning as a proactive gifting/event preparation assistant.

**Specifications:**

**1. Event Profile Creation:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate with calendar APIs (with user permission), social media event announcements (birthdays, engagements), publicly available data (baby registries, graduation announcements), and historical purchase data.
*   **Event Type Categorization:**  Define a comprehensive taxonomy of life events: Birthdays, Anniversaries, New Baby, Graduations, Housewarming, Get Well Soon, Congratulations (Job, Achievement), Sympathy, Holidays (expand beyond major ones).
*   **Event Intensity/Formality:** Model event 'intensity' (e.g., 1st Birthday vs. 50th Birthday, casual get-together vs. formal dinner). This is determined through analysis of associated data - guest list size, location, communicated themes, etc.

**2. Bundle Generation Engine:**

*   **Bundle Templates:** Pre-defined bundle templates exist for each event type, ranging in price points & formality (e.g., “Basic New Baby Bundle” - diapers, wipes, lotion; “Luxury Anniversary Bundle” - jewelry, gourmet food, experience voucher).
*   **AI-Driven Customization:** Employ a recommendation engine to customize bundles based on user preferences (analyzed from purchase history, browsing data, social media interests), recipient profiles (if known), event intensity, and seasonal trends.
*   **Dynamic Pricing & Inventory:** Bundles dynamically adjust to reflect real-time pricing and inventory levels of constituent items.

**3. Predictive Gifting & Suggestion Interface:**

*   **Proactive Notifications:** System proactively suggests relevant bundles to users *before* event dates.  Example: “John’s niece is turning 5 next month.  Check out these suggested birthday bundles.”
*   **‘Gift Now’ / ‘Save for Later’ Options:**  Users can immediately purchase a suggested bundle, save it for later, or modify it.
*   **"Recipient Profile" Completion:**  If the system lacks recipient data, it prompts the user to complete a short “Recipient Profile” (interests, preferences, allergies, etc.).
*   **Multi-User Collaboration:**  Option to share bundle suggestions with other users (e.g., family members) for collaborative gifting.

**Pseudocode - Bundle Generation:**

```
function generate_bundle(event_type, user_profile, recipient_profile, event_intensity):
  // Load base bundle template for event_type
  base_bundle = load_template(event_type)

  // Apply user preferences (from user_profile) to adjust items in base_bundle
  filtered_items = filter_items(base_bundle.items, user_profile.preferences)

  // If recipient profile available, refine items further
  if recipient_profile:
      refined_items = filter_items(filtered_items, recipient_profile.preferences)
  else:
      refined_items = filtered_items

  // Adjust item quantities based on event intensity
  adjusted_quantities = adjust_quantities(refined_items, event_intensity)

  // Calculate total bundle price
  bundle_price = calculate_price(adjusted_quantities)

  // Return generated bundle
  return {
      "items": adjusted_quantities,
      "price": bundle_price
  }
```

**New Data Points to Capture:**

*   **Event Urgency:** How soon will the event occur?
*   **Social Circle Strength:**  Relationship between giver and recipient (close friend, family member, colleague).
*   **Gifting History:** Past gifts given to the recipient.
*   **Budget Constraints:** User-defined price range.
