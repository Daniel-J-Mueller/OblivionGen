## Dynamic CAPTCHA Difficulty Scaling with Behavioral Biometrics

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Behavioral Analysis Engine (BAE). This engine runs on the server-side and continuously monitors client-side interactions during the CAPTCHA solving process.
*   **Client-Side Data Collection:** Javascript embedded in the CAPTCHA presentation. Collects:
    *   Mouse movement (speed, acceleration, trajectory, pauses).
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure - if available, key combinations).
    *   Touchscreen data (swipe speed, pressure, contact area - on mobile devices).
    *   Screen interaction timing â€“ time to first interaction, total interaction time.
*   **Server-Side Processing:**
    *   BAE receives and analyzes the collected behavioral data.
    *   A "Behavioral Risk Score" (BRS) is calculated. The BRS is a numerical representation of the likelihood that the user is a bot, based on the deviation from established human behavioral patterns.
    *   CAPTCHA difficulty is *dynamically* adjusted based on the BRS. 
        *   BRS < 30: Standard CAPTCHA (image recognition, simple text distortion).
        *   30 <= BRS < 70: Moderate CAPTCHA (more complex image distortion, slightly obscured text, audio CAPTCHAs with moderate noise).
        *   BRS >= 70:  Advanced CAPTCHA (complex 3D image recognition, video segmentation, multi-step challenges, requiring interaction with a simulated environment).
*   **CAPTCHA Types:** The system supports a library of various CAPTCHA types, allowing the BAE to select the most appropriate challenge based on the BRS.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The BAE utilizes machine learning algorithms to continuously refine its behavioral models. This allows it to adapt to evolving bot techniques and improve the accuracy of its risk assessments.
*   **Integration:** Integrates with existing handshake protocols described in patent 10055591. The BAE runs *before* the CAPTCHA is presented, determining the appropriate difficulty *before* the user even sees the challenge. The BRS, *not* a static difficulty setting, is included as part of the shared secret generation, adding an extra layer of security.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side - Simplified):**

```
function handle_handshake(client_connection):
    behavioral_data = collect_initial_behavioral_data(client_connection)
    brs = calculate_behavioral_risk_score(behavioral_data)

    if brs < 30:
        captcha_type = "simple_image"
        captcha_difficulty = "easy"
    elif brs < 70:
        captcha_type = "complex_image"
        captcha_difficulty = "medium"
    else:
        captcha_type = "3d_object_recognition"
        captcha_difficulty = "hard"

    generate_captcha(captcha_type, captcha_difficulty)
    send_captcha_to_client(client_connection)

    user_solution = receive_user_solution(client_connection)
    if verify_solution(user_solution):
        shared_secret = generate_shared_secret(user_solution, brs) #BRS is included
        establish_encrypted_connection(client_connection, shared_secret)
    else:
        reject_connection()
```

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond static CAPTCHA difficulties. By dynamically adjusting the challenge based on *real-time* user behavior, it provides a significantly more robust defense against automated attacks.  The inclusion of the BRS in the shared secret generation makes it even harder for attackers to predict or bypass the security measures. It's also subtly more user-friendly - legitimate users are presented with challenges appropriate to their skill level, minimizing frustration.
