## Secure Data ‘Sharding’ with Dynamic Key Orchestration

**Concept:** Expand the inherent security of the storage device by introducing a data sharding mechanism *within* the device, coupled with dynamically orchestrated keys for each shard. This aims to increase resilience against key compromise and enhance data privacy.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shard Creation & Management Module:**

*   **Function:** Responsible for dividing incoming data into multiple shards (configurable shard count: 2-N).
*   **Algorithm:** Employ a pseudo-random deterministic algorithm to split data. Seeded with a master key (derived from external key provisioning) and a unique data identifier. This ensures consistent shard creation for the same data.
*   **Shard Size:** Configurable, but default to 1MB – 10MB.
*   **Metadata:** Each shard is associated with metadata indicating its shard number, total shard count, and the encryption key used.

**2. Dynamic Key Generation & Assignment:**

*   **Key Hierarchy:** Utilize a key derivation function (KDF) based on the internal master key and a unique shard identifier. This KDF generates a unique data encryption key (DEK) for *each* shard.
*   **Key Rotation:** Implement scheduled or event-triggered key rotation for each shard. Trigger events could include data access, time elapsed, or security alerts. This adds a layer of complexity for potential attackers.
*   **Key Storage:** Store DEKs using hardware-based encryption (AES-256) within the storage device's secure enclave.

**3. Data Access Protocol:**

*   **Request:** Client requests data by identifier.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Device retrieves metadata for the requested data.
    *   Device identifies shards.
    *   Device retrieves DEKs for each shard.
    *   Device decrypts shards in parallel using hardware acceleration.
    *   Device reassembles data.
    *   Device returns assembled data.
*   **Pseudocode (Data Retrieval):**

```
FUNCTION retrieveData(dataIdentifier):
  metadata = getMetadata(dataIdentifier)
  shardCount = metadata.shardCount
  shardKeys = []
  FOR i = 0 TO shardCount - 1:
    shardKey = deriveKey(masterKey, metadata.shardIdentifier + i) //Shard specific key
    shardKeys.append(shardKey)
  shards = []
  FOR i = 0 TO shardCount - 1:
    shardData = readShard(metadata.shardIdentifier + i)
    decryptedShard = decrypt(shardData, shardKeys[i])
    shards.append(decryptedShard)
  assembledData = assemble(shards)
  RETURN assembledData
```

**4. Security Enhancements:**

*   **Threshold Cryptography:** Implement a threshold cryptography scheme. Require a minimum number of shards to be present to reconstruct the data. This provides resilience against the loss or compromise of individual shards.
*   **Tamper Detection:** Include tamper detection mechanisms for each shard. Any unauthorized modification of a shard triggers an alert and potentially renders the shard unusable.
*   **Data Redundancy:** Introduce optional data redundancy through erasure coding. Distribute data across multiple shards to allow for the reconstruction of data even if some shards are lost or corrupted.

**5. Integration with Existing Firmware:**

*   Module should be implemented as a firmware extension to the existing HSM functionality.
*   Existing key provisioning mechanisms should be leveraged for master key management.
*   Hardware acceleration features should be utilized for encryption, decryption, and key derivation.

**Possible Applications:**

*   Enhanced data security for cloud storage environments.
*   Secure data storage for IoT devices.
*   Protection of sensitive data in enterprise environments.
