## Adaptive Block Size Prediction via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust block sizes for encoding/decoding based on content complexity, leveraging a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to optimize compression efficiency and reduce computational load. This builds on the idea of block-based processing in the provided patent but introduces intelligent, content-aware block size selection.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **RL Agent:** A deep Q-network (DQN) or similar RL algorithm. The state space represents local image characteristics (e.g., variance, entropy, edge density) within a candidate block. The action space represents possible block sizes (e.g., 4x4, 8x8, 16x16, 32x32, adaptive splitting). The reward function is based on a combination of compression ratio (lower is better) and computational cost (lower is better).
*   **Feature Extractor:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) module to extract relevant features from candidate blocks to feed into the RL agent. This could be pre-trained on a large dataset of images/videos.
*   **Block Partitioning Module:** Responsible for dividing the frame into candidate blocks and applying the block size selected by the RL agent.
*   **Encoding/Decoding Pipeline:** The existing encoding/decoding algorithms are integrated, operating on blocks of the dynamically determined sizes.
*   **Globally-Shared Memory Integration:** The system leverages the globally-shared memory described in the patent to store image data, intermediate results, and RL agent parameters.

**2. RL Agent Training:**

*   **Training Data:** A large dataset of diverse images and videos.
*   **Reward Function:**  `Reward = -α * CompressionRatio + β * ComputationalCost`. Where α and β are weighting factors determined empirically. CompressionRatio is bits-per-pixel. ComputationalCost can be estimated as the number of operations required for encoding/decoding the block (e.g., DCT, quantization, entropy coding).
*   **Training Procedure:** The RL agent learns to predict the optimal block size for each block based on its features, maximizing the cumulative reward over the training dataset.  Techniques like experience replay and target networks can be used to stabilize training.

**3. Pseudocode (Encoding):**

```
function EncodeFrame(frame):
  blocks = DivideFrameIntoCandidates(frame)
  encoded_blocks = []

  for block in blocks:
    features = ExtractFeatures(block)
    block_size = RL_Agent.PredictBlockSize(features)
    encoded_block = EncodeBlock(block, block_size) # Existing encoding functions
    encoded_blocks.append(encoded_block)

  return encoded_blocks
```

**4. Pseudocode (Decoding):**

```
function DecodeFrame(encoded_blocks):
  decoded_blocks = []

  for encoded_block in encoded_blocks:
    block_size = GetBlockSize(encoded_block) # Metadata associated with the block
    decoded_block = DecodeBlock(encoded_block, block_size) # Existing decoding functions
    decoded_blocks.append(decoded_block)

  return ReconstructFrame(decoded_blocks)
```

**5.  Hardware Considerations:**

*   **Parallelization:** The feature extraction, RL agent prediction, and encoding/decoding of individual blocks can be highly parallelized, utilizing the software-configurable general-purpose processors in the parallel processing unit.
*   **Memory Access:** Efficient access to the globally-shared memory is crucial for performance. Data locality optimization techniques can be employed to minimize memory access latency.
*   **FPGA/ASIC Acceleration:**  The feature extraction and RL agent prediction modules can be accelerated using dedicated hardware implementations on FPGAs or ASICs.
