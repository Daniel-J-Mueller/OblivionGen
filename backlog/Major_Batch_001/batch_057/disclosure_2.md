**Dynamic Path Stitching with Predictive Pre-computation**

**Specification:**

**I. Overview**

This system extends fast re-route (FRR) concepts by introducing dynamic path stitching coupled with predictive pre-computation of alternate paths.  Instead of relying solely on a pre-defined backup path per link failure (as typical FRR does), this system proactively calculates *multiple* potential alternate paths, weighted by predicted network congestion and latency.  These are maintained in a 'Path Stitching Table' (PST). Upon primary path failure, the system *stitches* together the most optimal path from the PST, potentially utilizing segments from different pre-calculated options. This allows for finer-grained adaptation and avoids being locked into a single backup.

**II. Components**

*   **Path Computation Engine (PCE):** A distributed system responsible for continuously calculating alternate paths based on real-time network state (congestion, link utilization, latency) and predictive modeling. The PCE uses heuristics considering both shortest path and minimal congestion.
*   **Path Stitching Table (PST):**  A table stored in each network device, containing a list of pre-calculated alternate paths (path segments).  Each entry includes:
    *   Destination IP/Prefix
    *   Path Segment (list of next-hop IPs)
    *   Cost (weighted sum of latency, congestion, and hop count)
    *   Quality Score (based on historical performance and confidence in prediction)
*   **Failure Detection Module:** Existing link/node failure detection mechanisms.
*   **Path Selection & Stitching Logic:** A module that, upon primary path failure:
    *   Identifies available PST entries for the destination.
    *   Evaluates PST entries based on current network conditions.
    *   Stitches together optimal path segments to create a complete alternate path. Prioritization factors include lowest cost, highest quality score, and minimal path disruption.
*   **Traffic Steering Module:**  Directs traffic onto the stitched alternate path.

**III. Operation**

1.  **Proactive Path Calculation:** The PCE continuously calculates multiple alternate paths for common destinations, populating the PST in network devices.
2.  **Failure Detection:** The Failure Detection Module identifies a primary link or node failure.
3.  **Path Selection:**  The Path Selection & Stitching Logic queries the PST for available paths to the destination.
4.  **Path Stitching:** The logic evaluates and combines segments from multiple PST entries to create an optimized alternate path.  It considers factors like network congestion, quality scores, and path diversity.  The result is a ‘stitched path’.
5.  **Traffic Steering:** The Traffic Steering Module redirects traffic onto the stitched path.
6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors the performance of the stitched path and dynamically adjusts it if necessary, potentially re-stitching with different segments.

**IV. Pseudocode (Path Stitching Logic)**

```pseudocode
function StitchPath(destination, failed_interface):
  available_segments = PST.getSegments(destination) // Get all segments
  if (available_segments is empty):
    return NULL // No path available

  best_path = NULL
  min_cost = INFINITY

  for each segment in available_segments:
    current_path = segment
    current_cost = segment.cost

    // Extend path as far as possible with other segments
    while (current_path.destination != destination):
      best_next_segment = NULL
      min_next_cost = INFINITY

      for each next_segment in available_segments:
        if (next_segment.source == current_path.destination):
          if (next_segment.cost < min_next_cost):
            best_next_segment = next_segment
            min_next_cost = next_segment.cost

      if (best_next_segment is NULL):
        break // Path cannot be extended further

      current_path.append(best_next_segment)
      current_cost += best_next_segment.cost

    if (current_path.destination == destination and current_cost < min_cost):
      min_cost = current_cost
      best_path = current_path

  return best_path
```

**V. Potential Improvements**

*   **AI-Powered Prediction:** Integrate machine learning to improve the accuracy of path prediction and congestion forecasting.
*   **Segment Granularity:** Explore using finer-grained path segments (e.g., individual links) to increase flexibility.
*   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically detect and repair broken path segments.
*   **Multi-Path Stitching**: Utilize multiple stitched paths in parallel to increase bandwidth and resilience.
