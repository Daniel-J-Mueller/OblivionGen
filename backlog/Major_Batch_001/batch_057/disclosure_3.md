## Dynamic Network Topology Mapping & Predictive Pathing

**Concept:** Extend the multi-path routing system to *actively* map network topology in real-time and predict future path performance based on observed trends, allowing for proactive path selection *before* congestion occurs. The current patent focuses on reacting to network conditions; this aims to anticipate them.

**Specs:**

*   **Topology Mapper Module:**
    *   Continuous probing (beyond the described patent's periodic checks) using a variety of probe packet types (ICMP, TCP SYN, UDP) to identify intermediary nodes (routers, switches) along each path.
    *   Data collection: Records latency, packet loss, jitter, and bandwidth at each hop.
    *   Topology Graph: Constructs a dynamic graph representing the network topology, weighted by performance metrics.  Nodes represent network devices, edges represent paths.
    *   Graph updates:  Continuously updates the graph based on probe results. Node and edge weights adjusted dynamically.
*   **Predictive Pathing Engine:**
    *   Time-Series Analysis:  Analyzes historical performance data (latency, loss, bandwidth) for each path and intermediary node. Utilizes techniques like ARIMA or LSTM to predict future performance.
    *   Congestion Prediction: Identifies potential congestion points based on predicted performance trends.
    *   Path Scoring:  Assigns a score to each potential path based on predicted performance, hop count, and cost (e.g., bandwidth usage).
    *   Lookahead Algorithm:  Simulates data flow across multiple paths for a specified lookahead time (e.g., 5-10 seconds) to determine the path with the lowest predicted cost.
*   **Adaptive Multiplexing:**
    *   Dynamic Flow Distribution:  Distributes data flows across multiple paths based on the Predictive Pathing Engine's recommendations.
    *   Real-time Adjustment: Continuously monitors path performance and adjusts flow distribution in real-time to optimize throughput and minimize latency.
    *   Flow Prioritization:  Allows prioritization of certain flows based on application requirements.
*   **Interface:**
    *   API: Provides an API for applications to request optimal paths and configure flow prioritization.
    *   Visualization Tool: A graphical tool for visualizing the network topology, path performance, and flow distribution.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Pathing Engine):**

```
function predict_path_performance(path, historical_data, lookahead_time):
  // historical_data is a time-series of latency, loss, bandwidth for each hop on the path
  // lookahead_time is the time horizon for the prediction (e.g., 5 seconds)

  // 1. Forecast performance metrics for each hop using time-series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM)
  predicted_latency = forecast(historical_data.latency)
  predicted_loss = forecast(historical_data.loss)
  predicted_bandwidth = forecast(historical_data.bandwidth)

  // 2. Calculate a path cost based on predicted metrics
  path_cost = calculate_cost(predicted_latency, predicted_loss, predicted_bandwidth, path.hop_count)

  return path_cost

function select_optimal_path(paths, current_time):
  best_path = null
  min_cost = infinity

  for path in paths:
    cost = predict_path_performance(path, get_historical_data(path), lookahead_time)
    if cost < min_cost:
      min_cost = cost
      best_path = path

  return best_path
```

**Novelty:** While the original patent reacts to congestion, this system *proactively* predicts and avoids it. It shifts from a reactive to a predictive paradigm using time-series analysis and topology mapping, enabling a significantly more efficient and resilient network experience. This is not simply about better metrics, but about actively *shaping* the network traffic based on anticipated conditions.
