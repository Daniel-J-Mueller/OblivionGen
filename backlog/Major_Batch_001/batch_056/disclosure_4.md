## Dynamic Configuration Inheritance with Predictive Resolution

**Concept:** Extend the tree-based configuration system to allow for *predictive* inheritance. Instead of simply inheriting properties from a source node when requested, the system proactively anticipates likely inheritance needs based on application behavior and pre-fetches/resolves inherited values. This improves performance and enables advanced scenarios like configuration ‘shadowing’ for A/B testing or staged rollouts.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Inheritance Engine:**

*   **Behavioral Profiler:** Monitors application requests for configuration values.  Logs patterns of access – which nodes are frequently accessed together, and the time between accessing parent and child nodes.
*   **Inheritance Graph Builder:**  Constructs a secondary graph representing probable inheritance paths based on the behavioral profiler data. Weights edges based on frequency of access.
*   **Prefetch Queue:** Maintains a queue of likely inherited values, calculated from the inheritance graph. Prioritizes values based on access probability and latency of retrieval.
*   **Shadow Configuration Store:** A cache storing pre-fetched inherited values, separate from the main configuration store. This allows for quick access and prevents impacting the primary configuration service during resolution.

**2.  Configuration Resolution Process:**

*   **Initial Request:** Application requests a configuration value from a specified node.
*   **Local Check:** System first checks if the value exists locally at the requested node.
*   **Shadow Check:** If not found locally, check the Shadow Configuration Store.
*   **Inheritance Resolution:** If not in the Shadow Store, traverse the inheritance tree as currently implemented.
*   **Prefetch & Cache:** *Asynchronously*, prefetch the inherited value *and* values for likely sibling or descendant nodes, storing them in the Shadow Configuration Store. Update the Inheritance Graph Builder with this new usage information.

**3.  Configuration ‘Shadowing’ for A/B Testing & Rollouts:**

*   **Variant Assignment:**  Application provides a ‘variant’ identifier (e.g., ‘A’, ‘B’) for a given feature.
*   **Shadow Node Mapping:**  A mapping defines alternative source nodes for inheritance based on the variant. For example: `featureX.variantA -> sourceNodeA`, `featureX.variantB -> sourceNodeB`.
*   **Modified Inheritance Resolution:** During inheritance resolution, if a variant is associated with the requested node, prioritize the mapped source node *before* the standard parent node. This effectively creates a ‘shadow’ configuration for the specified variant.

**Pseudocode (Inheritance Resolution):**

```
function resolveConfiguration(node, key, variant):
  if node has key:
    return node[key]

  if shadowCache has key:
    return shadowCache[key]

  if variant exists and node has variantMapping:
    shadowSource = node.variantMapping[variant]
    value = resolveConfiguration(shadowSource, key, variant) //Recursive call
    if value is not null:
      shadowCache[key] = value
      return value

  parent = node.parent
  if parent is not null:
    value = resolveConfiguration(parent, key, variant) //Recursive call
    if value is not null:
      shadowCache[key] = value
      return value

  return null // Value not found
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Node`: Represents a configuration node. Contains:
    *   `key`: Configuration key.
    *   `value`: Configuration value (if present).
    *   `parent`: Pointer to parent node.
    *   `variantMapping`: Dictionary mapping variant IDs to alternative source nodes.
*   `ShadowCache`: In-memory cache for pre-fetched configuration values.  Uses a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy.
*   `InheritanceGraph`: Graph representation of probable inheritance paths. Edges are weighted based on access frequency.
