## Adaptive Clock Phase Interpolation

**Specification:** A system for generating a target clock frequency via phase interpolation of two clock signals derived from a single input clock, dynamically adjusting the interpolation point based on a predictive error model.

**Components:**

*   **Input Clock Source:** Standard clock signal.
*   **Frequency Division Network:** Two independently controllable frequency dividers. Divider A & Divider B.
*   **Phase Accumulators (PA):** Two digital phase accumulators, one for each divider output. Controlled by a shared, dynamically adjustable interpolation factor (IF).
*   **Interpolation Logic:** Digital logic performing linear (or higher-order) interpolation between the PA outputs.
*   **Predictive Error Model (PEM):** A digital signal processor (DSP) or microcontroller implementing a predictive algorithm. This estimates the difference between the interpolated clock and the target frequency.
*   **Control Circuitry:** Logic governing the frequency dividers, phase accumulators, and PEM.
*   **Output Buffer:** Provides clean output signal.

**Operation:**

1.  **Base Clocks Generation:** Frequency dividers A and B divide the input clock to generate two base clocks with frequencies fA and fB. These frequencies are selected to bracket the target frequency (fT).
2.  **Phase Accumulation:** The base clocks drive the phase accumulators. The interpolation factor (IF) determines the relative contribution of each base clock to the final interpolated phase.
3.  **Interpolation:** The interpolation logic combines the accumulated phases, weighted by the interpolation factor, to generate the interpolated clock signal.
4.  **Error Prediction:** The PEM continuously monitors the phase difference between the interpolated clock and a reference signal representing the target frequency. The PEM predicts future phase errors based on past behavior.
5.  **Adaptive Interpolation:** The control circuitry adjusts the interpolation factor (IF) based on the error prediction from the PEM, to minimize the phase difference. The IF is updated at a higher rate than any correction can be made through solely the frequency dividers.
6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The frequency dividers themselves can be adjusted more slowly, widening or narrowing the bracket around the target frequency.

**Pseudocode (Control Circuitry - Update Loop):**

```
loop:
    // Read phase error from PEM
    error = PEM.getPhaseError()

    // Calculate IF adjustment based on error
    if_adjustment = error * gain  // 'gain' is a tuning parameter

    // Limit the IF adjustment to prevent instability
    if_adjustment = clamp(if_adjustment, -max_adjustment, max_adjustment)

    // Update the interpolation factor
    interpolation_factor += if_adjustment

    // Clamp interpolation factor between 0 and 1
    interpolation_factor = clamp(interpolation_factor, 0.0, 1.0)

    // Slow adjustment of divider frequencies based on long term error.
    long_term_error = PEM.getLongTermError()
    if (abs(long_term_error) > threshold):
        if(long_term_error > 0):
            decrease_divider_a_frequency()
            increase_divider_b_frequency()
        else:
            increase_divider_a_frequency()
            decrease_divider_b_frequency()

    // Update clock divider frequencies (slowly).
    update_divider_frequencies()

    // Output interpolated clock
    output_interpolated_clock()
```

**Novelty:** The combination of high-speed interpolation factor adjustment coupled with slower frequency divider control allows for extremely precise clock generation, even with non-integer division ratios. The predictive error model enhances stability and minimizes drift. This is different than simply switching between two fixed frequencies, or attempting to average them. The dynamic IF allows for continuous, analog-like frequency adjustment. It introduces an element of feedback and predictive modelling.
