## Dynamic Diffraction Panels

**Concept:** Integrate micro-diffraction gratings within the colorless regions of the electrowetting display to create dynamic light manipulation â€“ essentially turning each pixel into a miniature projector or beam steering device.

**Specs:**

*   **Micro-grating Material:**  Thin-film interference stacks of materials with high refractive index contrast (e.g., TiO2/SiO2). Layer thicknesses tuned to diffract specific wavelengths of light. Material must be compatible with electrowetting fluid and support plate.
*   **Grating Structure:**  Arrays of 1D or 2D diffraction gratings etched into the colorless region material.  Grating period (pitch) ranges from 200nm to 1um, optimized for visible light diffraction.  Different grating periods implemented in adjacent colorless regions to generate diverse diffraction patterns.
*   **Electrowetting Control:**  Integrate transparent electrodes *beneath* the gratings. Apply voltage to modify the refractive index of a thin dielectric layer above the grating.  This changes the effective pitch of the grating and thus the diffraction angle.
*   **Colorless Region Geometry:**  Colorless regions are not flat planes.  Micro-lens structures etched into the surface to enhance diffraction efficiency and focus/collimated diffracted beams.  The shape of the micro-lenses controlled by electrowetting.
*   **Addressing Scheme:**  Each colorless region acts as an individual diffraction element, controlled by an associated electrode.  Array addressing via multiplexed row/column control.  Higher resolution diffraction control via sub-pixel electrode addressing.
*   **Display Integration:**  Color filter and electrowetting cell are layered *above* the diffraction element. The color filter modulates the diffracted light.

**Pseudocode (control sequence for single pixel):**

```
FUNCTION control_diffraction(pixel_x, pixel_y, angle_x, angle_y, color)
  // angle_x, angle_y in degrees
  // color: red, green, blue, or off
  
  SET electrode_voltage(pixel_x, pixel_y, calculate_voltage(angle_x, angle_y))
  
  IF color == red
    SET color_filter(pixel_x, pixel_y, red)
  ELSE IF color == green
    SET color_filter(pixel_x, pixel_y, green)
  ELSE IF color == blue
    SET color_filter(pixel_x, pixel_y, blue)
  ELSE
    SET color_filter(pixel_x, pixel_y, transparent)
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculate_voltage(angle_x, angle_y)
  // Use a lookup table or mathematical model to map desired diffraction angles to electrode voltage.
  // Model accounts for grating period, dielectric properties, and fluid characteristics.
  
  voltage = lookup_table[angle_x][angle_y]
  
  RETURN voltage
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Holographic Displays:** Generate 3D images by manipulating the phase and amplitude of diffracted light.
*   **Beam Steering LiDAR:** Create a solid-state LiDAR system by directing diffracted beams to scan the environment.
*   **Augmented Reality:** Project information onto surfaces by precisely controlling the direction of diffracted light.
*   **Dynamic Lighting:** Create customizable lighting effects by shaping and directing the light output.
