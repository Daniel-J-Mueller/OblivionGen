## Adaptive Resource Injection & Behavioral Mirroring

**Concept:** Extend the targeted script functionality to not just *test* system behavior, but to temporarily *become* a component of it, injecting limited-scope, controlled resources to observe system adaptation in real-time. This moves beyond passive testing toward active, directed evolution observation.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Resource Definition Language (RDL):**
    *   A declarative language to define injectable resources. These resources are not full applications, but lightweight components focusing on specific interactions (e.g., a simulated network interface with controlled latency, a limited-memory data store, a CPU usage governor).
    *   RDL specifies: Resource type, interaction points (APIs, network ports, file system paths), performance characteristics (latency, throughput, memory usage), failure modes.

2.  **Injection Engine:**
    *   Part of the local targeted script management component.
    *   Dynamically loads RDL definitions and creates the corresponding resource instances within the target host.
    *   Manages resource lifecycle (creation, activation, deactivation, destruction).
    *   Handles communication between the injected resource and the host system.

3.  **Behavioral Mirroring Module:**
    *   Observes system responses to the injected resource.
    *   Tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) – CPU usage, memory allocation, network I/O, disk I/O.
    *   Identifies adaptation mechanisms – auto-scaling, load balancing, process prioritization, caching strategies.
    *   Generates a "Behavioral Profile" – a dynamic representation of how the system adapts to changing resource conditions.

4.  **Dynamic Scenario Generation:**
    *   Automatically generates test scenarios by manipulating the injected resource.
    *   Ramps up/down resource usage, introduces latency spikes, simulates network outages.
    *   Uses the Behavioral Profile to predict system responses and optimize scenario generation.

5.  **Restoration Enhancement:**
    *   The restoration information captures not just the system state *before* script execution, but also the Behavioral Profile generated during execution.
    *   Allows restoration to a specific adaptation state, not just the initial state.

**Pseudocode (Scenario Generation):**

```pseudocode
function GenerateScenario(target_system, behavioral_profile):
  // Define initial resource parameters
  resource_params = {
    type: "simulated_network_interface",
    bandwidth: 100 Mbps,
    latency: 10 ms
  }

  // Create resource instance
  resource = CreateResource(resource_params)

  // Calculate next test point based on behavioral profile
  next_test_point = CalculateNextTestPoint(behavioral_profile)

  // Apply test point to resource
  ApplyTestPoint(resource, next_test_point)

  // Monitor system response
  system_response = MonitorSystemResponse(target_system)

  // Update behavioral profile
  UpdateBehavioralProfile(behavioral_profile, system_response)

  return system_response
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple script execution toward *directed experimentation*. By actively injecting resources and observing adaptation, we can gain a deeper understanding of system resilience and optimize its behavior. The Behavioral Profile provides a dynamic model of system intelligence, enabling more sophisticated testing and analysis.
