## Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment in Interactive Fiction

**Concept:** Expand the ‘automatic delivery’ concept to interactive fiction experiences (text adventures, visual novels with branching paths). Instead of just delivering *more* content, deliver content *tailored to the player’s skill level and engagement* – dynamically adjusting the difficulty and complexity of the narrative based on real-time player choices and performance.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** A ‘Narrative Engine’ integrated into existing interactive fiction platforms (Twine, Ren'Py, etc.). This engine monitors player actions (choices made, puzzles solved, time spent on sections, ‘failure’ rates – e.g., dying in combat or failing skill checks).
*   **Difficulty Metrics:** Define quantifiable metrics for narrative difficulty. Examples:
    *   *Branching Factor*: Number of meaningful choices available at a given point.
    *   *Puzzle Complexity*:  Based on the number of steps to solve, required logic, and information needed.  Assign numerical values to puzzle components.
    *   *Combat Difficulty*:  Enemy stats, available resources, and encounter frequency.
    *   *Information Density*:  Amount of lore and detail presented within a scene.
*   **Player Profile:** The engine builds a dynamic ‘Player Profile’ based on observed performance. This profile stores:
    *   *Skill Scores*:  Estimated player competence in various areas (e.g., logic, combat, social interaction). Updated continuously.
    *   *Engagement Level*:  Measured by response time, choice diversity, and backtracking/exploration.
    *   *Preferred Narrative Style*: Identification of preferred themes, pacing, and character archetypes.
*   **Content Database:**  The game content is modular, comprising:
    *   *Scene Fragments*: Short, self-contained narrative segments.
    *   *Puzzle Modules*: Pre-built puzzle components with adjustable difficulty.
    *   *Character Interactions*: Dialogue trees with branching options and dynamic responses.
*   **Dynamic Assembly:** The Narrative Engine assembles the game experience in real-time based on the Player Profile.
    *   *Difficulty Adjustment*:  Selects Scene Fragments and Puzzle Modules that match the player's skill level.
    *   *Branching Control*: Influences the direction of the narrative based on the player's preferences and choices.
    *   *Content Injection*: Adds or removes narrative elements (lore, side quests, characters) to maintain engagement and cater to individual interests.
*   **Pseudocode – Dynamic Scene Selection:**

```
function selectNextScene(playerProfile) {
  // 1. Determine target difficulty range based on playerProfile.skillScore
  targetDifficulty = calculateTargetDifficulty(playerProfile.skillScore);

  // 2. Filter available scenes based on targetDifficulty
  filteredScenes = sceneDatabase.filter(scene => scene.difficulty >= targetDifficulty.min && scene.difficulty <= targetDifficulty.max);

  // 3. Prioritize scenes based on player engagement & preferences
  scoredScenes = scoredScenes.sort( (a, b) => {
    engagementScoreA = calculateEngagementScore(a, playerProfile);
    engagementScoreB = calculateEngagementScore(b, playerProfile);
    return engagementScoreB - engagementScoreA;
  });

  // 4. Select the highest-scoring scene
  nextScene = scoredScenes[0];

  return nextScene;
}

function calculateEngagementScore(scene, playerProfile) {
  score = 0;
  if (scene.themes.includes(playerProfile.preferredThemes)) { score += 10; }
  if (scene.characters.includes(playerProfile.preferredCharacters)) { score += 5; }
  return score;
}
```

**Novelty:**  This moves beyond simply *delivering* content to dynamically *constructing* a personalized narrative experience.  It shifts the emphasis from pre-authored stories to adaptive storytelling, where the game actively responds to the player's actions and preferences.  This fosters heightened engagement and replayability.
