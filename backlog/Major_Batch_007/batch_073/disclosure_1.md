## Adaptive Trace Granularity

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting the granularity of traces collected for deduplication and analysis, optimizing resource usage and analytical fidelity.

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on deduplicating *entire* traces. This system allows traces to be broken down into smaller, potentially reusable sub-traces *during* collection. This addresses scenarios where only *parts* of a trace are duplicated across different requests, or where very long traces create significant overhead.

**Components:**

*   **Trace Splitter:** A component deployed at the ingress of the tracing system. It monitors incoming trace data and employs a configurable algorithm to identify logical breakpoints within a trace. Breakpoints can be defined based on service boundaries, function calls, or elapsed time.
*   **Sub-Trace Repository:** A storage system optimized for storing and retrieving sub-traces. This could be an in-memory cache, a specialized key-value store, or an extension of the existing trace storage.
*   **Deduplication Engine (Modified):**  The existing deduplication engine is enhanced to handle sub-traces. It searches for matching fingerprints not only within complete traces but also within the sub-trace repository.
*   **Reassembly Module:** A component responsible for reassembling sub-traces into complete traces when required for analysis or visualization.
*   **Granularity Policy Manager:**  A configurable module defining the rules for trace splitting. This allows administrators to define different granularity levels based on service, environment, or time of day.

**Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
function process_trace(trace_data):
  trace = parse_trace(trace_data)
  policy = get_granularity_policy(trace.service_name)

  if policy.granularity == "full":
    return trace # No splitting

  sub_traces = split_trace(trace, policy.split_interval, policy.split_criteria)

  for sub_trace in sub_traces:
    fingerprint = generate_fingerprint(sub_trace)
    
    if fingerprint exists in sub_trace_repository:
      # Sub-trace already exists.  Store reference instead of full data.
      store_sub_trace_reference(trace, sub_trace) 
      update_statistics(sub_trace, "hit_count")
    else:
      # New sub-trace.  Store data.
      store_sub_trace(sub_trace)
      update_statistics(sub_trace, "new_count")

  return trace # Trace now contains references to sub-traces or complete data
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Sub-Trace:** {fingerprint: string, data: trace_segment, statistics: {hit_count: int, new_count: int}}
*   **Granularity Policy:** {service_name: string, granularity: enum(full, medium, fine), split_interval: int, split_criteria: enum(service_boundary, time_interval)}

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Fingerprint generation should be optimized for fast comparisons.
*   Caching of frequently accessed sub-traces is crucial for performance.
*   The Reassembly Module must handle cases where sub-traces are missing or incomplete.
*   The Granularity Policy Manager should allow for dynamic updates without service interruption.
*   Telemetry should be added to track the effectiveness of different granularity levels.
