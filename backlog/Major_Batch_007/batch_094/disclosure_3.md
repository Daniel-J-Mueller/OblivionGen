## Temporal Data Weaving – Predictive Rollback & Forwarding

**Concept:** Extend versioned protection groups beyond simple point-in-time recovery to proactively ‘weave’ likely future database states based on query patterns and transaction trends. This enables both predictive rollback (mitigating errors *before* they fully manifest) and ‘what-if’ analysis via forward-time application of transactions to these woven states.

**Specification:**

**1. Temporal Weaver Service:** A new service component, residing alongside the database engine and storage nodes, responsible for constructing and managing woven database states.

**2. Query & Transaction Monitoring:** The Temporal Weaver Service intercepts and analyzes database queries and transactions in real-time.  Key metrics tracked include:

    *   Query frequency & complexity
    *   Transaction types (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) & affected data
    *   User/application initiating the transaction
    *   Transaction success/failure rates

**3. Probabilistic State Construction:** The service utilizes machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks, transformers) trained on historical query/transaction data to predict likely future database states.  

    *   **Weighted State Trees:** Instead of single woven states, maintain a tree of weighted possible states. Each branch represents a plausible path of transactions. Weights indicate probability based on model predictions.
    *   **State Granularity:**  States are constructed at the *page* level, mirroring the versioned protection groups. This allows for efficient storage and rollback.
    *   **Delta-Encoding:**  Woven states are not full copies of the database. Instead, they store *deltas* from the last stable protection group, minimizing storage overhead.

**4. Predictive Rollback Mechanism:**

    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Real-time monitoring of transactions against predicted states. Significant deviations trigger alerts.
    *   **Automated Rollback (Optional):** Configurable thresholds for automated rollback to the most recent predicted state *before* the anomaly occurred.  This requires careful consideration to avoid false positives.
    *   **Rollback Granularity:** Rollback applies only to the affected pages, minimizing disruption.

**5. ‘What-If’ Analysis:**

    *   **Sandbox Environment:** Users can submit ‘what-if’ transactions to a cloned woven state *without* affecting the production database.
    *   **Simulation & Visualization:** The system simulates the transaction and visualizes the resulting changes to the database state.
    *   **Performance Testing:**  Users can test the performance of new queries against the simulated state.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Rollback):**

```
// On each transaction:
1.  Capture transaction details (query, data, user)
2.  Predict next database state (woven_state) using ML model
3.  Compare woven_state to current database state
4.  Calculate deviation score (e.g., using diff algorithms on affected pages)
5.  If deviation_score > threshold:
    a.  Alert administrator
    b.  If auto_rollback_enabled:
        i.   Rollback to last stable woven state (or pre-defined safe point)
        ii.  Apply transaction to safe point and create a new woven state.
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `WovenState`:
    *   `state_id`: Unique identifier
    *   `timestamp`: Time of state creation
    *   `delta_pages`: List of modified pages (page_id, data_diff)
    *   `probability`: Confidence score
*   `TransactionRecord`:
    *   `transaction_id`: Unique identifier
    *   `query`: SQL query
    *   `data`: Modified data
    *   `user`: User/application initiating transaction

**Integration Points:**

*   Database Engine: Intercept queries/transactions, apply rollbacks.
*   Storage Nodes: Store/retrieve woven state deltas.
*   Monitoring System: Collect metrics, generate alerts.
*   User Interface: Provide ‘what-if’ analysis sandbox.
