**Spectral Beamforming Array for Multi-Target Tracking**

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple beam *positioning* to active beam *steering* and spectral analysis, enabling simultaneous tracking of multiple light sources/targets with enhanced resolution and data extraction.

**Specs:**

*   **Detector Array:** 8x8 array of SPADs (Single Photon Avalanche Diodes) – allowing for both position *and* time-of-flight (ToF) data. Each SPAD incorporates a micro-lens for focused light collection.
*   **Optical Elements:**
    *   Tunable Acousto-Optic Modulator (AOM) placed *before* the dispersive element. This AOM modulates the incoming light frequency slightly, creating a spectral 'fingerprint' for each target.
    *   Diffractive grating (dispersive element) – standard, providing spectral separation.
    *   Variable Focus Lens – adjustable focal length to optimize image clarity across different distances.
*   **Beam Steering:** Utilizing micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) mirrors positioned *after* the variable focus lens, but *before* the detector array, allowing for dynamic, rapid steering of the focused light onto specific SPADs within the array.
*   **Electronics/Processing:**
    *   FPGA-based processing unit: Handles real-time data acquisition from the SPAD array, AOM control, MEMS mirror control, and initial data processing.
    *   Algorithm:
        1.  AOM sweeps through a frequency range, modulating the incoming light.
        2.  MEMS mirrors scan the incoming light across the SPAD array.
        3.  SPADs record both photon arrival time and position.
        4.  FPGA processes data to create a 3D spectral signature for each detected light source – position, ToF, and frequency modulation profile.
        5.  Machine learning algorithms identify and track multiple targets simultaneously based on these spectral signatures.
*   **Power:** 5V DC, 2A.
*   **Dimensions:** 10cm x 10cm x 5cm.
*   **Materials:** Lightweight aluminum alloy chassis, silicon SPAD array, glass/plastic optical components.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
initialize_spad_array()
initialize_aom()
initialize_mems_mirrors()
initialize_fpga()

// Main Loop
while (true) {

    // AOM Frequency Sweep
    for (frequency = min_frequency to max_frequency step frequency_increment) {
        set_aom_frequency(frequency)

        // MEMS Mirror Scan
        for (x = min_x to max_x step x_increment) {
            for (y = min_y to max_y step y_increment) {
                set_mems_mirror_position(x, y)
                read_spad_array() // Returns photon arrival data (x, y, time)
                process_photon_data() // Associates data with frequency, x, y
            }
        }
    }

    // Target Tracking & Identification
    identify_targets() // Uses ML algorithms on spectral signatures
    track_targets() // Updates target positions over time

    // Output Target Data (Position, Velocity, Spectral Signature)
}
```

**Innovation:** This system isn’t just *detecting* a beam; it's actively probing it with modulated light and building a unique spectral fingerprint. This allows for simultaneous tracking of multiple sources, even if they overlap spatially, and extraction of additional data like velocity and material composition (based on the spectral signature). The active beam steering adds another layer of control and precision. This moves beyond simple positioning to become a powerful multi-parameter sensing and tracking system.
