## Adaptive Min-Wise Hashing with Dynamic Feature Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the min-wise hashing approach to dynamically adjust the granularity of feature combinations based on observed data distribution. This allows the system to focus computational resources on high-impact feature interactions while reducing the burden of exploring less relevant ones.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Distribution Analyzer:**

*   **Input:** Streaming data set (observation records).
*   **Function:** Continuously monitors the frequency of feature value combinations (pairs, triplets, etc.).  Utilizes a sliding window to capture temporal shifts in data distribution.  Employs a configurable “granularity threshold” parameter.
*   **Output:**  A prioritized list of feature combinations, ranked by frequency.  Flags feature combinations exceeding the granularity threshold.

**2. Dynamic Feature Generator:**

*   **Input:** Prioritized list of feature combinations from the Data Distribution Analyzer.
*   **Function:**  Based on the prioritized list, dynamically creates higher-order features.  A “feature creation budget” limits the total number of features generated. The budget can be fixed or dynamically adjusted based on available resources. Prioritizes feature creation based on the following criteria:
    *   Frequency (from the Data Distribution Analyzer)
    *   Feature “novelty” – measures the extent to which a feature introduces new information not already captured by existing features. This could be calculated using information gain or a similar metric.
*   **Output:** Set of higher-order features.

**3. Adaptive Min-Wise Hashing Engine:**

*   **Input:** Data set, set of higher-order features.
*   **Function:** Performs min-wise hashing using the dynamically generated set of higher-order features. Employs a “hashing level” parameter to control the number of hash functions used. This parameter can be adjusted based on the desired accuracy and computational cost.  Implement a caching mechanism to store frequently accessed hash values.
*   **Output:** Set of multidimensional signatures.

**4. Correlation Metric Calculator:**

*   **Input:** Multidimensional signatures, target variable.
*   **Function:** Calculates correlation metrics between the higher-order features and the target variable using the multidimensional signatures. Utilizes a parallel processing framework to speed up calculations.
*   **Output:** Correlation metrics for each higher-order feature.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Min-Wise Hashing Engine):**

```
function AdaptiveMinWiseHash(data, features, numHashFunctions):
  signatures = []
  for record in data:
    signature = []
    for i in range(numHashFunctions):
      minHash = INFINITY
      for feature in features:
        hashValue = HashFunction(feature + record) //Concatenate feature and record
        minHash = min(minHash, hashValue)
      signature.append(minHash)
    signatures.append(signature)
  return signatures
```

**Resource Considerations:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires sufficient memory to store the data set, higher-order features, and multidimensional signatures.  Benefits from parallel processing capabilities for faster calculations.
*   **Software:** Requires a robust hashing library and a parallel processing framework.
*   **Configuration:** The system should be configurable to adjust the granularity threshold, feature creation budget, hashing level, and other parameters based on the specific data set and available resources.
