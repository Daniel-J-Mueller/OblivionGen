**Dynamic Occlusion Mapping with Real-World Material Properties**

**Concept:** Extend AR visualization beyond simply *placing* a virtual object into a scene. Allow the virtual object to realistically interact with the physical environment, specifically regarding light and material interaction – beyond simple shadowing.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sensor Suite:** Utilize the device’s camera *and* a short-range depth sensor (ToF or structured light). Additionally, integrate a colorimeter capable of basic spectral analysis of surfaces.
2.  **Real-Time Material Capture:** When the user aims the device at a surface, the system analyzes the color and spectral reflectance data to determine basic material properties (roughness, reflectivity, basic color profile – approximating BRDF parameters). This isn't full material identification, but a sufficient approximation for visual realism.
3.  **Occlusion Mesh Generation:** The depth sensor generates a real-time mesh of the detected environment. This mesh isn’t for rendering the environment itself, but for *occlusion* and material interaction with virtual objects.
4.  **Dynamic Material Assignment:** The captured material properties are dynamically assigned to sections of the occlusion mesh that are closest to the virtual object. This creates a ‘material map’ of the physical environment around the virtual object.
5.  **Physically-Based Rendering (PBR):** The virtual object rendering engine utilizes PBR. Lighting calculations aren't just based on virtual lights, but on the captured real-world lighting *and* the material properties of the surrounding physical environment. This means light bouncing off a real-world red wall affects the virtual object's color, and vice-versa.
6.  **Refraction/Reflection Mapping:** For transparent or reflective virtual objects, the system can utilize the captured environment map to realistically simulate reflections and refractions.
7. **Virtual Object Deformation:** Allow slight deformation of the virtual object based on contact with the occlusion mesh. A virtual pillow, for instance, would realistically depress if 'placed' on a sofa.
8. **Surface Adhesion Simulation**: Simulate basic surface adhesion/stickiness. A virtual object 'placed' on a textured surface will adhere more convincingly if the texture is rough.

**Pseudocode (Rendering Loop):**

```
For each virtual object:
    // Calculate lighting from virtual light sources
    lighting = calculateVirtualLighting(object, virtualLights)

    // Capture real-world lighting and material properties
    realWorldLighting = captureRealWorldLighting(camera, depthSensor, colorimeter)
    materialMap = generateMaterialMap(depthSensor, colorimeter)

    // Combine lighting and material data
    combinedLighting = combineLighting(lighting, realWorldLighting, materialMap)

    // Render the object using PBR and combined lighting
    renderObject(object, combinedLighting)
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Assisted Material Identification:** Use machine learning to improve the accuracy of material identification based on spectral analysis.
*   **Dynamic Environment Mapping:** Update the environment map in real-time as the user moves the device.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:** Combine visual realism with haptic feedback to simulate the feel of the virtual object interacting with the physical environment.
