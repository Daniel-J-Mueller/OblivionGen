**Dynamic Haptic Feedback System for Quasi-Virtual Objects**

**Concept:** Extend the augmented reality experience beyond visual and auditory cues by integrating localized haptic feedback directly onto the quasi-virtual object’s surface. This creates a more immersive and intuitive interaction.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   **Miniature Haptic Actuators:** An array of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)-based haptic actuators embedded within or adhered to the surface of the quasi-virtual object. These actuators will generate localized vibrations, textures, or even subtle pressure changes.  Density: 100 actuators/10cm<sup>2</sup>.  Actuation frequency range: 20Hz – 2kHz.  Maximum displacement: 50 microns.
    *   **Transparent Conductive Layer:** A thin, transparent conductive layer coating the quasi-virtual object’s surface to power and control the haptic actuators.  Material: Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) or similar.  Sheet resistance: < 10 ohms/sq.
    *   **Proximity Sensors:**  An array of infrared proximity sensors integrated around the quasi-virtual object to detect user hand/finger positions and distances. Range: 1mm-100mm. Accuracy: +/- 0.5mm.
    *   **Control Unit:** A small, low-power microcontroller housed within the quasi-virtual object to process sensor data and control the haptic actuators.  Processor: ARM Cortex-M4.  Memory: 256KB Flash, 64KB RAM.  Communication: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
    *   **Power Source:** Rechargeable thin-film battery integrated into the quasi-virtual object. Capacity: 500 mAh.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Sensor Fusion Algorithm:** An algorithm to combine data from proximity sensors to accurately track user hand/finger movements and determine contact points. Kalman filter implementation.
    *   **Haptic Pattern Library:** A library of pre-defined haptic patterns corresponding to different actions, textures, or events. Example patterns: “click,” “rough,” “smooth,” “pulse,” “vibrate.”
    *   **Dynamic Haptic Mapping:**  A system to dynamically map haptic patterns onto the quasi-virtual object’s surface based on user interaction and the visual overlay.
    *   **AR Integration:** Software to integrate the haptic feedback system with the existing AR platform, receiving data about the virtual environment and user interactions.  Communication protocol:  UDP.
*   **Operational Pseudocode:**

    ```
    //Main Loop
    While (AR_System_Running)
    {
        Receive AR_Data (Virtual Overlay, User Interactions, Object State)
        Process Sensor Data (Proximity Sensors)
        Determine Contact Points (User Hand/Fingers)
        Select Haptic Pattern (Based on AR_Data & Contact Points)
        Map Haptic Pattern to Contact Points
        Activate Haptic Actuators
        Delay(10ms)
    }
    ```
*   **Example Scenarios:**
    *   **Virtual Buttons:** Provide tactile feedback when a user “presses” a virtual button on the quasi-virtual object.
    *   **Texture Simulation:**  Simulate the texture of a virtual object (e.g., wood, metal, fabric) by dynamically adjusting the haptic patterns on the quasi-virtual object’s surface.
    *   **Force Feedback:**  Provide subtle force feedback when a user interacts with a virtual object (e.g., “pushing” a virtual lever).
    *   **Alerts & Notifications:**  Use haptic feedback to provide discreet alerts and notifications (e.g., a gentle vibration when a virtual message is received).
* **Materials:** Primarily passive plastic shell as described in the patent.  Actuators will need to be coated with a biocompatible, flexible polymer for direct skin contact.
