## Adaptive Proximity-Based Difficulty Scaling

**Concept:** Leverage proximity data between users *during* testing to dynamically adjust question difficulty, creating a more personalized and challenging experience. This goes beyond simply detecting cheating; it aims to optimize the testing environment for each user based on their immediate surroundings and potential for collaboration.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **User Devices:** Standard testing devices (tablets, laptops) with built-in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beaconing capabilities.
*   **BLE Beacon Network:** Strategically placed BLE beacons throughout the testing environment (room, hall). These provide a more precise location triangulation than device-to-device proximity alone.
*   **Central Server:** A server responsible for data collection, analysis, and difficulty adjustment.

**2. Data Collection:**

*   **Device Proximity:** Continuously scan for nearby user devices via BLE. Record Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values to estimate distance.
*   **Beacon Proximity:**  Record RSSI values from nearby BLE beacons.
*   **User Response Data:** Capture all user responses, timestamps, and behavioral data (eye tracking, keystroke dynamics – mirroring the existing patent's approach).
*   **Environmental Data:** (Optional) Integrate data from environmental sensors (noise levels, lighting) to further refine difficulty adjustments.

**3. Algorithm & Logic:**

*   **Proximity Scoring:**  Calculate a “Collaboration Risk Score” for each user based on:
    *   Number of nearby users (within a defined radius).
    *   Strength of BLE signals from nearby devices (higher RSSI = closer proximity).
    *   Beacon triangulation data providing precise location.
    *   Time spent in close proximity to other users.
*   **Difficulty Adjustment Matrix:**  A pre-defined matrix mapping Collaboration Risk Scores to difficulty adjustment factors.  For example:
    *   Low Risk (isolated):  Difficulty factor = 1.0 (standard difficulty)
    *   Medium Risk (nearby users): Difficulty factor = 1.2 (slightly harder questions)
    *   High Risk (very close proximity, potential collusion): Difficulty factor = 1.5 (significantly harder questions, unique question sets)
*   **Question Selection:**
    *   The central server maintains a large question bank categorized by difficulty level and subject area.
    *   Based on the user’s Collaboration Risk Score and the Difficulty Adjustment Matrix, the server selects questions with the appropriate difficulty level.
    *   To prevent memorization or sharing of answers, the server rotates questions within the difficulty category and introduces unique, dynamically generated questions where possible.

**4.  Pseudocode:**

```
// For each user during testing:

// 1. Collect Proximity Data
proximityData = getProximityData(userDevice);

// 2. Calculate Collaboration Risk Score
riskScore = calculateRiskScore(proximityData);

// 3. Determine Difficulty Adjustment Factor
difficultyFactor = lookupDifficultyFactor(riskScore);

// 4. Select Question
question = selectQuestion(userKnowledgeLevel, difficultyFactor);

// 5. Present Question to User
presentQuestion(question);
```

**5.  Advanced Features:**

*   **Dynamic Question Generation:** Integrate AI-powered question generation to create unique questions on the fly, adapting to the user's skill level and the surrounding environment.
*   **Adaptive Testing:**  Combine proximity-based difficulty scaling with traditional adaptive testing techniques to personalize the testing experience even further.
*   **Real-time Intervention:**  If a user’s Collaboration Risk Score exceeds a critical threshold, trigger an alert to proctors or automatically adjust the testing environment (e.g., move the user to a different location).
*   **Historical Data Analysis:**  Analyze historical proximity data and testing results to identify patterns of collusion and improve the algorithm's accuracy.
