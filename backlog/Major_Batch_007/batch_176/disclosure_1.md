## Secure Biometric Authentication Token - "EchoKey"

**Concept:** Integrate a subvocal (silent speech) recognition system into the two-display authentication token system. Instead of relying solely on a one-time password *displayed* on a secondary screen, the system authenticates via a *spoken* (but unheard) passphrase detected by a dedicated, isolated microphone and processing unit. 

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   **Primary Device:** Existing system with general-purpose display and first circuitry (processor/memory).
    *   **Token Module:** Existing secondary display & second circuitry. *Plus:*
        *   **Subvocal Microphone:** High-sensitivity, directional microphone embedded in the bezel of the secondary display. Optimized for capturing subvocalizations (muscle movements during silent speech). Shielded to minimize interference.
        *   **Dedicated Audio Processor:** Low-power, secure processor dedicated to audio processing. Contains a secure enclave for storing and verifying the user's subvocal passphrase model.
        *   **Secure Memory:** Dedicated, tamper-resistant memory for storing the user's subvocal passphrase model and related cryptographic keys.
        *   **Vibration Sensor:** Piezoelectric sensor integrated into the module to detect and filter out external vibrations which could compromise audio input.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Enrollment Phase:**
        1.  User selects a passphrase during initial setup.
        2.  User silently "speaks" the passphrase multiple times.
        3.  Dedicated audio processor analyzes the subvocal muscle movements.
        4.  A personalized subvocal passphrase model is created and securely stored.
    *   **Authentication Phase:**
        1.  First circuitry prompts user for authentication.
        2.  User silently "speaks" the passphrase.
        3.  Dedicated audio processor analyzes the subvocal input.
        4.  The input is compared to the stored subvocal model.
        5.  If a match is found, a secure token is generated and displayed on the secondary screen.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   First and second circuitry communicate via a unidirectional data channel.
    *   Second circuitry *only* transmits a "Pass/Fail" signal to the first circuitry. No raw audio or authentication data is shared.
*   **Power Management:**
    *   Dedicated power supply for the audio processor and microphone.
    *   Low-power modes for inactive periods.
*   **Security Enhancements:**
    *   Electromagnetic shielding between first and second circuitry.
    *   Tamper-detection mechanisms in the token module.
    *   Regular self-testing of the audio processor and microphone.
    *   Noise-cancellation & vibration-filtering algorithms.

**Pseudocode (Authentication Phase):**

```
// First Circuitry
DISPLAY "Authentication Required"
WAIT for User Input (Trigger Token)

// Second Circuitry (Token Module - running concurrently)
FUNCTION authenticate()
  START microphone
  CAPTURE audio data
  APPLY noise reduction and vibration filtering
  EXTRACT subvocal features
  COMPARE features to stored model
  IF match:
    GENERATE secure token
    DISPLAY token on secondary screen
    RETURN "Pass"
  ELSE:
    RETURN "Fail"

// First Circuitry
RESULT = Second Circuitry.authenticate()
IF RESULT == "Pass":
  DISPLAY "Authentication Successful"
ELSE:
  DISPLAY "Authentication Failed"
```

**Novelty:** This combines visual one-time passwords with *silent* biometric authentication, adding a significant layer of security and user convenience. It bypasses the need to *see* a code and removes the risk of shoulder surfing or camera-based attacks.
