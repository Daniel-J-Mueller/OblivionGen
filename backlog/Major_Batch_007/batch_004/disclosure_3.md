## Adaptive Security Zone Orchestration

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting security zone boundaries based on real-time risk assessment, extending the sandboxed iframe concept.

**Core Concept:** Instead of a static separation between host and embedded application, establish a fluid security perimeter defined by granular permission controls and real-time analysis of application behavior.

**Components:**

*   **Risk Assessment Engine (RAE):** Continuously monitors the actions of both the host and embedded applications. This includes tracking API calls, network requests, data access patterns, and resource utilization. Utilizes machine learning models to identify anomalous behavior indicative of potential threats.
*   **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP):** Intercepts all communication between the host and embedded applications. Based on RAE analysis and pre-defined security policies, the PEP can:
    *   Allow communication.
    *   Redirec requests to a monitoring/logging service
    *   Throttle bandwidth or request rates.
    *   Drop the request entirely.
    *   Temporarily 'shrink' the sandboxed zone – removing access to specific resources or APIs.
    *   'Expand' the sandboxed zone – granting controlled access to additional resources.
*   **Zone Definition Language (ZDL):** A declarative language used to define granular security zones. ZDL allows developers to specify precise permissions for each application, resource, and API. Example:

```zdl
zone IDE_frontend {
  permissions {
    access development_service {
      read: true
      write: true
      rate_limit: 100/minute
    }
    access network {
      allowed_domains: ["api.example.com", "cdn.example.com"]
    }
    access file_system {
      allowed_paths: ["/tmp/ide_data"]
    }
  }
}
```

*   **Dynamic Zone Manager (DZM):** A service responsible for interpreting ZDL policies, managing the PEP, and communicating with the RAE to adjust security zones in real-time.

**Operation:**

1.  The host application and embedded application are initially loaded within separate, sandboxed environments.
2.  The DZM loads the ZDL policy for each application, configuring the PEP to enforce initial permissions.
3.  The RAE continuously monitors application behavior, generating risk scores and anomaly alerts.
4.  If the RAE detects suspicious activity, it sends an alert to the DZM.
5.  The DZM dynamically adjusts the PEP configuration, tightening or loosening security zones based on the risk level and pre-defined policies.
6.  The system logs all security zone adjustments, providing an audit trail for security investigations.

**Pseudocode (DZM – responding to RAE alert):**

```
function handleRAEAlert(alertData) {
  riskScore = alertData.riskScore
  applicationID = alertData.applicationID

  if (riskScore > thresholdHigh) {
    // Severely restrict access
    restrictZone(applicationID)
  } else if (riskScore > thresholdMedium) {
    // Moderate restriction
    moderateRestrictZone(applicationID)
  } else if (riskScore > thresholdLow) {
    // Log activity, monitor closely
    logActivity(applicationID)
  }
}

function restrictZone(applicationID) {
  // Revoke access to critical resources
  revokeResourceAccess(applicationID, "database")
  revokeResourceAccess(applicationID, "network")
}

function moderateRestrictZone(applicationID) {
  // Apply rate limiting
  applyRateLimit(applicationID, "API_calls", 10/minute)
}
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond static sandboxing by introducing *adaptive* security zones that respond to real-time threats. It creates a more dynamic and resilient security posture, improving overall system security without overly restricting legitimate application functionality.
