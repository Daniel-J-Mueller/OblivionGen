## Haptic Confirmation of Voice Command Capture

**Concept:** Integrate haptic feedback into the voice-controlled device to confirm successful audio capture *before* command processing begins. This addresses the ambiguity of whether the device 'heard' the user, especially in noisy environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Actuator:** Device incorporates a miniaturized haptic actuator (e.g., linear resonant actuator - LRA, or piezoelectric actuator) positioned for tactile feedback on the user’s hand/fingers when holding the device or, in the case of a stationary device, on a surface the user typically interacts with.
*   **Audio Level Threshold:** The device analyzes the incoming audio signal’s amplitude *immediately* upon receiving the external signal (as described in the provided patent).
*   **Haptic Trigger:** If the audio level *exceeds* a dynamically adjusted threshold (based on ambient noise assessment - see below), the haptic actuator is triggered for a brief duration (e.g., 50-150ms). This signals successful audio capture.
*   **Ambient Noise Assessment:** The device continuously monitors ambient noise levels via the microphone. This data is used to dynamically adjust the audio level threshold. The aim is to ensure the haptic feedback isn't triggered by background noise. A rolling average is calculated, with a decay factor to prioritize recent noise levels.
*   **User Customization:** Allow the user to adjust the haptic feedback intensity and duration via device settings.
*   **Optional Visual Confirmation:** Pair haptic feedback with a subtle visual cue (e.g., a brief LED pulse) for added confirmation.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Continuous Loop
while (true) {
    // Receive Signal from External Device (as per Patent)
    if (signalReceived) {
        // Begin Audio Capture
        startAudioCapture();

        // Assess Ambient Noise Level
        ambientNoise = calculateAmbientNoise();

        // Dynamically Adjust Threshold
        threshold = baseThreshold + (ambientNoise * adjustmentFactor);

        // Analyze Audio Level Immediately
        audioLevel = getInstantaneousAudioLevel();

        // Check if Audio Level Exceeds Threshold
        if (audioLevel > threshold) {
            // Trigger Haptic Feedback
            triggerHapticFeedback(intensity, duration);

            // Optional: Trigger Visual Confirmation
            triggerVisualConfirmation();

            // Proceed with Voice Command Processing
            processVoiceCommand();
        } else {
            // No sufficient audio detected.  Provide feedback.
            provideNoAudioFeedback(); // visual or auditory
        }
    }
}
```
