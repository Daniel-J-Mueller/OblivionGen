## Dynamic Trust Scoring with Ephemeral Credentials

**Concept:** Expand upon the device token system by introducing a dynamic trust score for each device, influencing the lifespan and permissions granted by its token. This combats compromised devices and enables fine-grained access control without constant re-registration.

**Specifications:**

**1. Trust Score Calculation:**

*   **Initial Score:** A device receives a base trust score upon successful registration.
*   **Behavioral Analysis:**  The system monitors device communication patterns (frequency, data volume, destinations, timing). Anomalies decrease the trust score.  Normal, expected behavior increases it.  A Bayesian approach is preferred.
*   **Reputation System:** Integration with a potential external reputation service (e.g., blocklists, known bad actors) to contribute to the trust score.
*   **Attestation:**  Periodic remote attestation of device integrity (software versions, boot state) to further refine the score.
*   **Score Decay:** Trust scores naturally decay over time, requiring ongoing positive behavior to maintain high levels.

**2.  Ephemeral Credentials:**

*   **Token Lifespan:** The device token lifespan is *directly* proportional to the device's current trust score. Low score = short lifespan. High score = extended lifespan.
*   **Permission Granularity:** The token includes permission flags determined by the trust score.  Higher scores unlock access to more sensitive resources.  Permissions can include:
    *   Data access levels (read-only, read-write, full access).
    *   Network resource access (specific services, bandwidth limits).
    *   Communication privileges (ability to initiate connections, multicast participation).
*   **Revocation:**  Even with a valid token, access can be revoked immediately if the trust score falls below a critical threshold.

**3.  System Architecture:**

*   **Trust Authority:** A dedicated service responsible for calculating and maintaining device trust scores.  This can be distributed for scalability.
*   **Token Service:** The existing service is modified to incorporate trust score information when generating tokens.
*   **Resource Guardians:**  Components protecting sensitive resources that *verify both* token validity *and* the associated trust score before granting access.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:**  System to detect sudden drops in trust scores or anomalous behavior.

**4.  Pseudocode (Token Generation):**

```
function generateToken(deviceId, authenticationInfo):
    trustScore = TrustAuthority.getTrustScore(deviceId)

    if trustScore < MIN_TRUST_THRESHOLD:
        log("Device trust score too low.  Token denied.")
        return null

    tokenLifespan = calculateTokenLifespan(trustScore)  // Example: lifespan = base + (trustScore * multiplier)
    permissions = calculatePermissions(trustScore)   // Example:  permissions based on tiered access levels

    token = new DeviceToken(deviceId, tokenLifespan, permissions)
    token.sign(privateKey)

    return token
```

**5.  Pseudocode (Resource Access):**

```
function accessResource(token, resourceId):
    if token.isValid():
        trustScore = TrustAuthority.getTrustScore(token.deviceId)
        if trustScore >= requiredTrustLevelForResource(resourceId):
            // Grant access
            return true
        else:
            // Deny access due to insufficient trust
            log("Access denied: insufficient trust level.")
            return false
    else:
        // Deny access: invalid token
        log("Access denied: invalid token.")
        return false
```

**6. Data Structures**
* DeviceTrustScore: { deviceId: string, score: float, lastUpdated: timestamp }
* DeviceToken: { deviceId: string, lifespan: timestamp, permissions: array, signature: string }
