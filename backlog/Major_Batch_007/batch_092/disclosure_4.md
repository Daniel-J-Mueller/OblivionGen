## Dynamic Pattern Resonance for Anomaly Detection

**Concept:** Expand the concept of pattern identification in log data beyond static frequency analysis to incorporate a "resonance" metric. This metric quantifies how strongly a new log entry *resonates* with established patterns, enabling more sensitive anomaly detection.

**Specification:**

**1. Resonance Profile Generation (Training Phase):**

*   **Input:** A corpus of structured log data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Establish a baseline word/phrase frequency map (as in the provided patent).
    *   For each established pattern (identified through frequency analysis), create a "resonance vector". This vector represents the weighted importance of each word/phrase *within* that pattern. Weights are determined by the frequency of the word/phrase within the pattern *relative* to its overall frequency in the corpus. Higher relative frequency = higher weight.
    *   Store these resonance vectors in a "Resonance Library".
*   **Output:** Resonance Library – a database of pattern-specific resonance vectors.

**2. Real-time Resonance Calculation (Analyzing Phase):**

*   **Input:** Incoming log entry (text stream).
*   **Process:**
    *   Preprocess the log entry (tokenize, normalize).
    *   Calculate a "log entry vector" representing the frequency of words/phrases in the log entry.
    *   For each resonance vector in the Resonance Library:
        *   Calculate the cosine similarity between the log entry vector and the resonance vector. This represents the degree to which the log entry "resonates" with that pattern.
        *   Multiply the cosine similarity by a pattern "activity score". Activity score is based on the recent frequency of that pattern in the log stream. Patterns appearing more frequently recently are given higher weight.
        *   Sum the weighted cosine similarities across all patterns.  This is the overall “Resonance Score”.
*   **Output:** Resonance Score – a single value indicating the degree to which the log entry aligns with established patterns.

**3. Anomaly Detection & Adaptive Learning:**

*   **Thresholding:** Establish a dynamic anomaly threshold based on the distribution of Resonance Scores over a rolling time window.
*   **Anomaly Alert:** Log entries with Resonance Scores falling below the threshold are flagged as anomalies.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**
    *   Analyze anomalous log entries to identify new patterns.
    *   Create new resonance vectors for these patterns.
    *   Add the new vectors to the Resonance Library.
    *   Adjust the anomaly threshold based on the evolving distribution of Resonance Scores.

**Pseudocode (Analyzing Phase – Resonance Calculation):**

```
function calculate_resonance(log_entry, resonance_library):
  log_entry_vector = create_vector_from_log_entry(log_entry)
  total_resonance = 0

  for pattern, resonance_vector in resonance_library:
    cosine_similarity = calculate_cosine_similarity(log_entry_vector, resonance_vector)
    pattern_activity = get_pattern_activity(pattern)  //Based on recent frequency
    weighted_similarity = cosine_similarity * pattern_activity
    total_resonance += weighted_similarity

  return total_resonance
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   High-performance vector processing capabilities (GPU or specialized accelerators) for efficient cosine similarity calculations.
*   Scalable data storage for the Resonance Library and historical log data.
*   Real-time stream processing framework (e.g., Apache Kafka, Apache Flink) for handling incoming log data.
*   Machine Learning libraries for adaptive thresholding and pattern identification.
