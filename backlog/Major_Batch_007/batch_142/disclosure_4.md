## Modular Morphing Aerial Vehicle – “Sky Serpent”

**Concept:** A bio-inspired aerial vehicle capable of dynamically altering its form factor *in flight* to optimize performance for varying mission profiles. It leverages the multi-propulsion system described in the referenced patent but expands on it with flexible, interconnected “segment” modules.

**Module Specs:**

*   **Segment Length:** 0.5 – 1.0 meters (adjustable via internal telescoping mechanism)
*   **Segment Diameter:** 0.2 – 0.3 meters
*   **Material:** Carbon fiber reinforced polymer with embedded shape memory alloys (SMA) and flexible electronics.
*   **Propulsion Unit:** Miniature ducted fan/EDF unit integrated into each segment, capable of independent thrust vectoring.  (Similar to patent, but scaled down & integrated *within* each segment).
*   **Inter-Segment Connection:** Ball-and-socket joint with integrated flexible wiring harness for power and data transmission.  Actuated by micro-servos for pitch/yaw control between segments.
*   **Power:** Distributed power system – high-density solid-state batteries within each segment. Wireless power transfer between segments possible for load balancing.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Each segment includes IMU, proximity sensors, and short-range communication. Centralized processing unit handles sensor fusion and control.

**Vehicle Configuration:**

*   **Base Configuration:** 6 – 12 segments connected in a linear “snake” configuration.
*   **Morphing Capabilities:**
    *   **Coiling:** Segments can coil around a central payload or structure for secure attachment.
    *   **S-Curve Bending:**  Allows for tighter turns and maneuverability in confined spaces.
    *   **Wing Formation:** Segments can extend laterally and flatten to create wing-like surfaces for efficient gliding or sustained flight.
    *   **Tripod/Quadruped Landing:**  Segments can deploy to form stable landing legs.

**Control System Pseudocode:**

```
// Define segment array
Segment[] segments;

// Function: Calculate target segment positions/orientations
function calculateSegmentPositions(missionProfile, environmentData) {
  // Analyze mission profile (speed, altitude, payload) and environment data (wind, obstacles)

  // Based on analysis, determine optimal vehicle configuration (linear, coiled, wing, etc.)

  // Calculate target position and orientation for each segment based on desired configuration

  return segmentPositions;
}

// Function: Send commands to each segment
function sendSegmentCommands(segmentPositions) {
  for each segment in segments {
    // Calculate required motor speeds for each propulsion unit to achieve target position/orientation

    // Send motor speed commands to segment controller

    // Send servo commands to adjust inter-segment angle
  }
}

// Main loop:
while (true) {
  // Get mission profile and environment data

  // Calculate segment positions

  // Send segment commands

  // Update vehicle state (position, velocity, orientation)
}
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simple 6DoF control to *dynamic reconfiguration*. The ability to morph the vehicle's shape in-flight opens up entirely new possibilities for aerial robotics, including:

*   **Inspection/Mapping:** Conforming to complex structures for detailed inspection.
*   **Search & Rescue:** Navigating confined spaces and adapting to unstable environments.
*   **Payload Delivery:** Securely cradling fragile or irregularly shaped payloads.
*   **Adaptive Aerodynamics:** Optimizing lift and drag for varying flight conditions.
