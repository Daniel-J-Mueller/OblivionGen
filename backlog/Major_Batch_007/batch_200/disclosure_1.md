## Projector Device - Adaptive Holographic Projection

**Concept:** A projector device capable of dynamically generating holographic projections *within* a contained volume of air, rather than projecting onto a surface. This utilizes phased arrays of ultrasonic transducers to create localized air pressure variations that refract light, forming stable, visible 3D images suspended in mid-air.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Phased array of 10,000+ micro-machined ultrasonic transducers (MUTs).  Each MUT individually addressable with precision timing control (picosecond resolution).  Array dimensions: 30cm x 30cm x 30cm.
*   **Light Source:** High-brightness, narrow-spectrum blue laser (450nm). Laser power adjustable from 1mW to 10W.  Laser beam split into 1000+ individual micro-beams via a diffractive optical element (DOE). Each micro-beam aligned with a corresponding MUT.
*   **Control System:**  FPGA-based real-time processing unit. Minimum processing speed: 1 THOPS (Tera Operations Per Second).
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **3D Model Input:** Accepts standard 3D model formats (OBJ, STL).
    2.  **Voxelization:** Converts 3D model into a volumetric representation (voxels). Voxel resolution adjustable (1mm³ - 0.1mm³).
    3.  **Holographic Field Calculation:**  Calculates the necessary ultrasonic interference pattern to refract light and form the desired 3D image. Algorithm leverages ray tracing and wave optics principles.
    4.  **Transducer Control Signal Generation:**  Generates individual timing signals for each MUT, controlling the phase and amplitude of the emitted ultrasonic waves.
    5.  **Real-time Feedback Loop:**  Incorporates a high-speed camera and image processing algorithms to monitor the projected image and dynamically adjust the transducer control signals to compensate for environmental factors (air currents, temperature variations).
*   **Airflow Management:** Integrated micro-blower system to minimize air currents within the projection volume and enhance image stability. Adjustable airflow rate.
*   **Housing:** Lightweight, modular enclosure constructed from carbon fiber. Includes ventilation system and acoustic damping materials.
*   **Power Supply:** High-efficiency power supply with support for both AC and DC input.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function generate_hologram(3D_model, voxel_resolution):
  voxels = voxelize(3D_model, voxel_resolution)
  for each voxel in voxels:
    position = voxel.position
    intensity = voxel.intensity
    calculate_interference_pattern(position, intensity)
    generate_transducer_signals(interference_pattern)
  update_transducer_signals_with_feedback()
```

**Novelty:** Existing holographic projection methods typically rely on projecting light onto reflective surfaces or specialized holographic films. This design creates a true volumetric display, suspending the image *in* the air without the need for any physical screen. The dynamic adjustment with feedback loops ensures stability and clarity, even in non-ideal environments.
