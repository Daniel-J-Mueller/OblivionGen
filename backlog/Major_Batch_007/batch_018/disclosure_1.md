## Adaptive Encryption Granularity with Dynamic Key Sharding

**Concept:** Rather than applying encryption at a file or block level, implement an encryption scheme that operates at a *variable*, data-dependent granularity. This combines with a dynamic key sharding approach to maximize security and minimize re-encryption overhead.

**Problem Addressed:** Traditional encryption often applies a uniform granularity. Sensitive data within a larger dataset might be unnecessarily encrypted, increasing computational load. Conversely, a single compromised key can expose large swaths of data.

**Innovation:**  Data is analyzed *during* encryption.  A "sensitivity map" is generated based on data type (PII, financial, public), content analysis (keywords, patterns), and potentially even real-time usage context.  This map determines a variable encryption block size *for each section of the data*.  Highly sensitive blocks receive small block sizes and are encrypted with a unique shard of the overall key. Less sensitive blocks receive larger block sizes and potentially use a shared key shard.

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensitivity Analyzer Module:**  A dedicated module responsible for data analysis and sensitivity map generation.  Utilizes NLP, pattern recognition, and configurable rules.  Output: Sensitivity Map (data section -> sensitivity level -> recommended block size -> key shard ID).
*   **Dynamic Key Shard Generator:**  Based on the Sensitivity Map, this module manages the key shards.  It dynamically generates, distributes, and rotates shards.  Shards are generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) seeded with a master key and the data's hash.  Key derivation functions (KDFs) like Argon2 or scrypt are used.
*   **Variable Block Encryption Engine:** Encrypts data using AES or ChaCha20, but dynamically adjusts the block size based on the Sensitivity Map.  Padding is applied as needed to ensure consistent block sizes *within* each section.
*   **Metadata Store:** Stores the Sensitivity Map, key shard assignments, and padding information alongside the encrypted data. Essential for decryption.

**Pseudocode (Encryption):**

```
function encryptData(data, masterKey):
    sensitivityMap = analyzeData(data)
    keyShards = generateKeyShards(masterKey, sensitivityMap)
    encryptedData = ""
    metadata = {}

    for section in data:
        sensitivityLevel = sensitivityMap[section]
        blockSize = determineBlockSize(sensitivityLevel)
        keyShardId = keyShards[section]
        keyShard = retrieveKeyShard(keyShardId)

        paddedSection = padData(section, blockSize)
        encryptedSection = encryptWithAES(paddedSection, keyShard)
        encryptedData += encryptedSection

        metadata[section] = {
            blockSize: blockSize,
            keyShardId: keyShardId
        }

    return encryptedData, metadata
```

**Pseudocode (Decryption):**

```
function decryptData(encryptedData, metadata, masterKey):
    decryptedData = ""

    for section in encryptedData:
        blockSize = metadata[section]['blockSize']
        keyShardId = metadata[section]['keyShardId']
        keyShard = retrieveKeyShard(keyShardId)

        decryptedSection = decryptWithAES(section, keyShard)
        unpaddedSection = unpadData(decryptedSection, blockSize)
        decryptedData += unpaddedSection

    return decryptedData
```

**Scalability and Considerations:**

*   **Distributed Key Management:** Key shards are not centrally stored, but distributed and dynamically provisioned to individual processing nodes.
*   **Computational Overhead:** Sensitivity analysis adds overhead. Optimize the analysis process for performance.
*   **Metadata Size:** The metadata store can grow large. Consider compression or indexing.
*   **Real-time Adaptation:**  The sensitivity map can be updated in real-time based on changing data usage patterns or external threat intelligence.
