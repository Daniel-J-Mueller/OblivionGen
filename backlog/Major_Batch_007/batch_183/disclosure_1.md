## Dynamic Contextual Bookmarking & 'Flow State' Reading

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing preview/bookmarking functionality with a system that *proactively* identifies and presents potentially relevant content based on reading speed, emotional cues (via device sensors), and content analysis, creating a 'flow state' reading experience.

**Specification:**

**1. Sensor Integration:**

*   **Reading Speed:** Device tracks scrolling/page turn speed (milliseconds/page or equivalent).
*   **Emotional State (Optional):** Utilize device camera (with user permission) for basic facial expression analysis (valence/arousal) or heart rate variability (HRV) via wearable integration. This is strictly optional for privacy reasons, with a clear opt-in.
*   **Environmental Data:** Integrate data such as time of day, location (general - e.g., home, commute, work) for contextual awareness.

**2. Content Analysis Engine:**

*   **Semantic Analysis:**  Analyze the text for key entities, topics, sentiment, and narrative structure.
*   **Similarity Scoring:** Calculate a similarity score between the current reading context (paragraph, page) and other sections within the ebook or external knowledge sources (linked databases, web articles).  This scoring will be a weighted average of semantic similarity, topic overlap, and narrative connection.
*   **'Narrative Thread' Detection:** Identify and track recurring themes, characters, or plot points throughout the ebook.

**3. Dynamic 'Flow State' Preview System:**

*   **Contextual Preview Generation:** Based on reading speed, emotional state (if enabled), environmental data, and content analysis, generate a dynamic preview 'card' or ‘bubble’ that appears subtly on the periphery of the screen.
*   **Preview Content:** The preview card displays:
    *   A short excerpt (1-3 sentences) from a section identified as highly relevant.
    *   A visual indicator of relevance (e.g., a colored bar representing the similarity score).
    *   A small icon representing the type of connection (e.g., character connection, topic connection, narrative echo).
*   **Adaptive Sensitivity:** Adjust the frequency and aggressiveness of preview generation based on user behavior.  If the user frequently ignores previews, reduce their appearance. If the user consistently engages with them, increase frequency and display more detailed information.
*   **'Deep Dive' Function:** Tapping the preview card instantly navigates the user to the relevant section within the ebook.
*    **Preview 'Stack':** Implement a small 'stack' of previews – 3-5 – which the user can cycle through without interrupting their current reading.

**4.  'Contextual Bookmarking' System**

*   **Automated Bookmark Suggestions:**  The system automatically suggests bookmarks for sections identified as significant (e.g., key plot twists, important character introductions).
*   **'Connection' Bookmarks:**  Allow users to create bookmarks that explicitly link to other sections within the ebook. (e.g. “Connects to chapter 3, where this character is first introduced.”)
*   **Bookmark 'Networks':**  Visualize bookmarks as a network graph, highlighting the connections between different sections of the ebook.

**Pseudocode (Preview Generation):**

```
function generatePreview(currentPage, readingSpeed, emotionalState, environment) {
  relevantSections = findRelevantSections(currentPage, readingSpeed, emotionalState, environment)
  if (relevantSections.length > 0) {
    bestSection = selectBestSection(relevantSections)
    excerpt = extractExcerpt(bestSection)
    relevanceScore = calculateRelevanceScore(currentPage, bestSection)
    previewCard = createPreviewCard(excerpt, relevanceScore)
    displayPreviewCard(previewCard)
  }
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Device with processing power for semantic analysis.
*   Optional: Camera for facial expression analysis.
*   Optional: Connectivity to wearable devices for HRV data.
*   High-resolution display for clear preview cards.
