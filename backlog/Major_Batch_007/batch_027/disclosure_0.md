## Dynamic Seed Rotation & Behavioral Biometrics Integration

**Specification:** A system augmenting pre-generated OTPs with continuously rotating device-specific seeds *and* real-time behavioral biometric analysis to dramatically enhance security beyond traditional time-based OTPs.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of solely relying on time windows and pre-generated codes, each device requesting authentication receives a uniquely derived seed *at the start of each session*. This seed, combined with the user's typical interaction patterns, becomes a crucial component in OTP generation *and* validation.

**System Components:**

1.  **Seed Generation & Distribution Server (SGDS):**  Responsible for generating and securely distributing unique session seeds to authorized devices. This seed is *not* a static, long-term key, but a short-lived, dynamically generated value.  Seed generation employs a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) incorporating entropy from multiple sources (system time, network activity, hardware sensors, etc.).

2.  **Behavioral Biometrics Engine (BBE):**  Continuously monitors user interaction patterns *during* the authentication process (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, touchscreen pressure, device orientation, app usage patterns). This data builds a 'behavioral profile' for each user.

3.  **Device Agent (DA):** Software residing on the user's device responsible for:
    *   Requesting a session seed from the SGDS.
    *   Collecting behavioral biometric data.
    *   Participating in OTP generation (see below).
    *   Transmitting biometric data to the Authentication Server.

4.  **Authentication Server (AS):**  Verifies OTPs and biometric data.

**OTP Generation Process (Device-Side):**

1.  DA requests a session seed from SGDS.
2.  DA combines:
    *   Session Seed
    *   Current Timestamp (High resolution)
    *   A small set of locally generated random numbers.
    *   A condensed 'feature vector' derived from recent behavioral biometric data.
3.  This combined data is fed into a one-way hash function (SHA-256 or similar).
4.  The resulting hash is truncated to generate the OTP.

**Authentication Process (Server-Side):**

1.  Device transmits OTP and raw behavioral biometric data to AS.
2.  AS independently generates an OTP based on the received biometric data, current timestamp, and the seed originally provisioned to the device.
3.  AS compares the device-generated OTP with the received OTP.  A 'fuzzy match' algorithm accounts for minor discrepancies.
4.  AS performs a separate analysis of the received biometric data, comparing it to the user’s established behavioral profile.
5.  Authentication is granted *only if* both the OTP comparison and the biometric profile comparison meet pre-defined thresholds.

**Pseudocode (Authentication Server – Verification):**

```
function verifyAuthentication(deviceOTP, biometricData, deviceSeed, timestamp):
  // Recalculate expected OTP
  recalculatedOTP = hash(deviceSeed + timestamp + randomNumbers + biometricData)
  otpMatch = compare(deviceOTP, recalculatedOTP, fuzzyMatchThreshold)

  // Analyze Biometric Data
  biometricProfile = getUserBiometricProfile(userID)
  biometricMatch = compare(biometricData, biometricProfile, biometricThreshold)

  if otpMatch AND biometricMatch:
    return AUTHENTICATED
  else:
    return FAILED
```

**Enhancements/Considerations:**

*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adjust OTP and biometric comparison thresholds based on risk factors (location, device type, transaction amount).
*   **Machine Learning for Biometric Profiling:**  Use machine learning algorithms to continuously refine user behavioral profiles and detect anomalies.
*   **Multi-Factor Integration:** Combine this system with other authentication methods (e.g., push notifications, biometric scanners) for even greater security.
*    **Seed Rotation Frequency:** Tune the frequency of seed rotation based on risk assessment. More frequent rotations increase security but may also impact user experience.
