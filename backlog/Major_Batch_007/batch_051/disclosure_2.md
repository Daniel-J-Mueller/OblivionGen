**Dynamic Attribute Weighting & Predictive Pricing**

**Concept:** Expand the existing attribute-based pricing suggestion system to *dynamically* weight attributes based on real-time market data and predictive modeling, rather than treating all attributes equally or using fixed weights. This allows the system to adapt to changing consumer preferences and market conditions, offering more accurate and competitive price suggestions.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Historical Transaction Data (as in the original patent)
    *   Real-time Web Scraping: Monitor competitor pricing for similar items.
    *   Social Media Sentiment Analysis: Track public opinion and demand for specific attributes (e.g., “eco-friendly,” “vintage,” “high-performance”).
    *   Search Trend Data: Analyze Google Trends and similar platforms to identify rising or falling demand for attribute combinations.
*   **Attribute Weighting Module:**
    *   **Model Type:** Utilize a Gradient Boosting Regression model or a Neural Network.
    *   **Input Features:** Historical transaction data (price, attributes), real-time market data (competitor pricing, social sentiment, search trends).
    *   **Output:** Dynamic weight assigned to each attribute for a given item classification and context.
    *   **Training Frequency:** Retrain the model daily or more frequently based on data volatility.
*   **Price Prediction Module:**
    *   **Input:** User-specified attributes, dynamic attribute weights.
    *   **Model Type:**  Random Forest Regression or another ensemble method known for its robustness.
    *   **Output:** Predicted price range with confidence intervals.
*   **User Interface Enhancements:**
    *   **Attribute Importance Visualization:** Display a chart showing the relative importance of each attribute in the price prediction.
    *   **"What-If" Analysis:** Allow users to adjust attribute values and see how the predicted price changes in real-time.
    *   **Personalized Price Suggestions:** Incorporate user purchase history and browsing behavior to tailor price suggestions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION calculate_price_range(item_classification, user_attributes):
  // 1. Retrieve Dynamic Attribute Weights
  attribute_weights = get_dynamic_attribute_weights(item_classification)

  // 2. Calculate Weighted Attribute Score
  weighted_score = 0
  FOR attribute, value IN user_attributes:
    weighted_score += attribute_weights[attribute] * value

  // 3.  Predict Price using trained model
  predicted_price = price_prediction_model.predict(weighted_score)

  // 4.  Determine Price Range based on confidence intervals
  price_range = [predicted_price - confidence_interval, predicted_price + confidence_interval]

  RETURN price_range
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:**  Design the system to handle a large number of item classifications and attributes efficiently.
*   **Data Quality:**  Implement data cleaning and validation procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data.
*   **Explainability:**  Provide insights into the factors that are driving the price predictions to build user trust and confidence.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Continuously A/B test different pricing strategies and model configurations to optimize performance.
