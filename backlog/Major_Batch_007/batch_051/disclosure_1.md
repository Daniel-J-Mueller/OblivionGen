## Dynamic Permission Drift & Predictive Revocation

**Concept:** Extend the delegation model to incorporate *predictive* revocation based on behavioral analysis of both delegator and delegatee. Not just *if* a policy changes, but *when* a change is likely, allowing for a ‘drift’ period where permissions are subtly adjusted *before* a formal revocation occurs.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Behavioral Profiling Module:**
    *   Input: Logs of resource access patterns for both delegator and delegatee. Resource type, frequency, time of day, data sensitivity.
    *   Process: Employ anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., LSTM networks, autoencoders) to build baseline profiles for each user.  Track deviations from these baselines.
    *   Output: A ‘risk score’ for both users, indicating the likelihood of policy violations or permission misuse. Separate scores for 'delegator trustworthiness' and 'delegatee risk'.

2.  **Permission Drift Engine:**
    *   Input: Risk scores from the Behavioral Profiling Module, existing delegated permissions, defined 'drift sensitivity' parameters (configurable per resource/permission).
    *   Process:
        *   Define ‘drift levels’ (e.g., Low, Medium, High).  Each level corresponds to a percentage reduction in permission scope.
        *   Based on combined risk scores and drift sensitivity, gradually reduce delegatee permissions *before* a formal revocation is triggered.  For example:
            *   Low Risk: No drift.
            *   Medium Risk:  Reduce access to less sensitive data by 10%.  Introduce logging/auditing of specific actions.
            *   High Risk:  Reduce access to all but essential resources by 50%. Alert administrators.
        *   Drift adjustments are applied *transparently* to the delegatee.
    *   Output: Adjusted permission set for the delegatee. Log of all drift adjustments.

3.  **Predictive Revocation Trigger:**
    *   Input:  Drift level, time since last drift adjustment, rate of change in risk scores, predefined thresholds.
    *   Process: If risk scores continue to escalate despite drift adjustments, or if the rate of change exceeds a threshold, a formal revocation is triggered.
    *   Output: Revocation notification.  Administrative alert.

4.  **Policy Conflict Resolution Engine:**
    *   Input: Delegatee's current permission set, delegated permissions from delegator, new/modified policy set.
    *   Process: Resolve conflicts between delegated permissions and the new policy set *before* applying them.
        *   Implement a conflict resolution strategy (e.g., deny access, alert administrator, apply most restrictive policy).
    *   Output: Adjusted permission set. Conflict resolution log.

**Pseudocode (Drift Engine):**

```
function apply_drift(delegatee_permissions, delegator_risk, delegatee_risk, drift_sensitivity) {
  drift_level = calculate_drift_level(delegator_risk, delegatee_risk, drift_sensitivity)

  if (drift_level == "Low") {
    return delegatee_permissions // No change
  } else if (drift_level == "Medium") {
    // Reduce access to less sensitive data by 10%
    reduced_permissions = filter_permissions(delegatee_permissions, sensitivity < "High")
    reduced_permissions = reduce_scope(reduced_permissions, 0.1)
    return reduced_permissions
  } else if (drift_level == "High") {
    // Reduce access to all but essential resources by 50%
    essential_permissions = filter_permissions(delegatee_permissions, is_essential == true)
    reduced_permissions = reduce_scope(essential_permissions, 0.5)
    return reduced_permissions
  }
}

function calculate_drift_level(delegator_risk, delegatee_risk, drift_sensitivity) {
  combined_risk = delegator_risk + delegatee_risk
  drift_threshold_low = 0.2
  drift_threshold_high = 0.5

  if (combined_risk < drift_threshold_low) {
    return "Low"
  } else if (combined_risk < drift_threshold_high) {
    return "Medium"
  } else {
    return "High"
  }
}
```

This system is designed to proactively manage risk, not just react to it, creating a more fluid and adaptable permissioning environment.
