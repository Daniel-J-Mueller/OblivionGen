## Dynamic Workspace Illumination & Haptic Feedback System

**Concept:** Expand beyond visual cues to incorporate dynamically adjusting workspace illumination *and* localized haptic feedback tied to the item-handling task, creating a multi-sensory guidance system. This aims to improve speed, accuracy, and reduce cognitive load for the operator.

**Specs:**

*   **Illumination System:**
    *   Array of individually addressable, high-intensity RGB LEDs embedded *within* the workstation surface (similar to an e-ink display, but for light). Resolution: 50 LEDs per square foot.
    *   Each LED capable of projecting a focused beam of light.
    *   Light intensity and color controlled by the central control system.
    *   Ambient Light Sensor: To dynamically adjust illumination levels based on existing lighting conditions.
*   **Haptic System:**
    *   Array of small, localized vibration motors (eccentric rotating mass â€“ ERM) also embedded within the workstation surface. Density: 25 motors per square foot.
    *   Each motor capable of independent operation and variable intensity.
    *   Surface material: Durable, flexible polymer allowing for vibration transmission without excessive noise.
*   **Sensor Integration:**
    *   Existing imaging sensors (geometric and visual data) remain central.
    *   Force/Pressure Sensors: Integrated beneath the workstation surface to detect object placement and operator interaction (e.g., pressure indicating an item is being picked up).
    *   Object Weight Sensors: To corroborate object identification and assist with weight-sensitive tasks.
*   **Control System Enhancements:**
    *   Task Decomposition: Software algorithm breaks down each item-handling task into a sequence of discrete steps.
    *   Multi-Sensory Cue Mapping: Each step is assigned both visual (projected cues), illumination (color/pattern), and haptic cues (vibration intensity/location).
    *   Dynamic Adjustment: The system continuously monitors operator progress (via imaging and force sensors) and adjusts cues in real-time.
    *   User Profiles: The system learns operator preferences and adapts cue intensity/type accordingly.
    *   Error Correction:  If an error is detected, the system provides stronger/more persistent cues to guide the operator.
    *   Integration with Voice Control: Allow for voice commands to initiate tasks or request assistance.

**Pseudocode (Cue Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateCues(taskStep, itemID, locationData, operatorProfile)

  // 1. Retrieve default cues for taskStep from cue database
  defaultCues = GetDefaultCues(taskStep)

  // 2. Adjust cues based on item properties
  IF itemID.fragile THEN
    defaultCues.hapticIntensity = Reduce(defaultCues.hapticIntensity, 50%)
    defaultCues.illuminationColor = "Yellow" //Gentle warning
  ENDIF

  // 3. Adjust cues based on operator profile (e.g., sensitivity to vibration)
  defaultCues.hapticIntensity = Scale(defaultCues.hapticIntensity, operatorProfile.hapticSensitivity)

  // 4. Adjust cues based on location (projected illumination pattern)
  illuminationPattern = CreateIlluminationPattern(locationData, defaultCues.illuminationColor)

  // 5. Return final cue set
  RETURN {
    visualCues: defaultCues.visualCues,
    illuminationPattern: illuminationPattern,
    hapticIntensity: defaultCues.hapticIntensity
  }

END FUNCTION
```

**Operation Example (Packing Task):**

1.  Operator scans item.
2.  System identifies item and calculates appropriate packing location.
3.  The workstation surface illuminates the target location with a specific color pattern.
4.  A localized vibration pattern guides the operator's hand to the correct placement point.
5.  Once the item is placed, the vibration stops, and the illumination changes to confirm correct placement.
