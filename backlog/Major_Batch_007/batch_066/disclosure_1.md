## Dynamic Interest Weighting Based on Real-Time Context

**Concept:** Extend the user interest ranking beyond static activity data by incorporating real-time contextual factors to dynamically adjust interest weights. This moves beyond simply *what* a user likes, to *when* they like it, enhancing the relevance of suggested points of interest.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Inputs:**

*   **User Activity Data:** (As defined in the patent) Browsing history, purchase history, social network activity, etc. – used for establishing baseline interest rankings.
*   **Real-Time Contextual Data:**
    *   **Time of Day:** (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening, night)
    *   **Day of Week:** (e.g., weekday, weekend, holiday)
    *   **Weather Conditions:** (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy, temperature)
    *   **Location-Based Events:** (e.g., concerts, festivals, sporting events happening near the route or at potential POIs) - API integration with event databases.
    *   **User’s Current Speed/Mode of Transportation:** (e.g., walking, driving, cycling) – determined by device sensors.
    *   **Calendar Integration:** (Optional, with user permission) - Awareness of scheduled meetings or appointments.

**2. Dynamic Weighting Algorithm:**

*   **Interest Profiles:** Maintain a profile for each user interest, including:
    *   *Base Weight*: Derived from historical activity data.
    *   *Contextual Modifiers*: A set of rules or machine learning models defining how the interest weight changes based on real-time context.  Example:
        *   “If time of day is between 6 PM and 9 PM AND weather is rainy, increase weight of ‘cozy restaurants’ by 30%.”
        *   “If mode of transportation is cycling, increase weight of ‘bike trails’ by 50%.”
*   **Weight Calculation:**  For each interest, calculate a *Current Weight* based on the Base Weight and any applicable Contextual Modifiers.
*   **Relevance Scoring:** The relevancy score for a point of interest will be based on the Current Weight of the matching user interest, not just the static base weight.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Contextual Data Ingestion Module:**  Responsible for collecting and processing real-time contextual data.
*   **Interest Weighting Engine:**  Applies the dynamic weighting algorithm to calculate Current Weights for each user interest.
*   **POI Recommendation Engine:**  Uses the Current Weights to rank and select points of interest.
*   **User Profile Database:**  Stores user interests, base weights, and contextual modifiers.
*   **API Integrations:** Event databases, weather services, calendar services, location services.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Function to calculate Current Weight for an interest
function calculateCurrentWeight(userInterest, currentTime, currentConditions, userMode) {
  baseWeight = userInterest.baseWeight;
  currentWeight = baseWeight;

  // Apply contextual modifiers
  if (currentTime is between 6 PM and 9 PM AND currentConditions is rainy) {
    currentWeight = currentWeight * 1.3;  // Increase weight by 30%
  }

  if (userMode is cycling) {
    currentWeight = currentWeight * 1.5; // Increase weight by 50%
  }

  return currentWeight;
}

// In POI recommendation process:
for each pointOfInterest {
  interest = findMatchingInterest(pointOfInterest);
  currentWeight = calculateCurrentWeight(interest, currentTime, currentConditions, userMode);
  relevanceScore = pointOfInterest.attributes * currentWeight;
}

// Rank POIs based on relevanceScore
```

**Novelty:** While the patent considers user interests, it doesn't incorporate dynamic, real-time contextual factors to *actively modify* those interest weights. This adds a layer of adaptability and personalization, making suggestions more relevant to the user's current situation. This moves beyond *predictive* recommendations to *adaptive* recommendations.
