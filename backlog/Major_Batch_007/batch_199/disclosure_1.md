## Proximity-Based Dynamic Social Network Synthesis

**Concept:** Extend the existing social network traversal to proactively *synthesize* temporary, context-aware social networks based on shared, real-time activity and predicted intent, rather than relying solely on established connections. This creates "ephemeral social graphs" useful for immediate assistance or information dissemination.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Inputs:**

*   **User A (Requesting):** Location (GPS/WiFi), stated need/query (text/voice), declared “trust radius” (distance), declared “information need profile” (keywords, topics).
*   **Nearby Users (Potential Connectors/Information Sources):** Location (GPS/WiFi), publicly declared/opt-in real-time activity (e.g., attending event, listening to specific music, following a news feed, sharing location within an app), inferred intent based on activity (e.g., someone at a concert is likely knowledgeable about the artist), opt-in “helpfulness” score (user-defined preference for assisting others).
*   **Public Data Streams:** Real-time event schedules, news feeds, social media trends (filtered based on User A’s information need profile).

**2. Processing Logic:**

*   **Dynamic Graph Construction:** A temporary graph is built, weighted by:
    *   **Proximity:** Distance between users.
    *   **Activity Overlap:**  How closely their current activities match User A's information need profile.
    *   **Helpfulness Score:** User’s self-declared willingness to help.
    *   **Shared Connections:** Existing social network links (as in the original patent).
*   **Intent Prediction:** Utilize machine learning models to predict the likely intent of nearby users based on their activities. For example:
    *   Someone browsing a map of a museum is likely knowledgeable about the exhibits.
    *   Someone posting about a traffic accident is likely aware of road closures.
*   **Query Propagation:** User A’s query is propagated through the dynamic graph, prioritizing nodes with high weights and relevant predicted intent.
*   **Response Aggregation:** Responses from multiple nodes are aggregated, ranked by relevance and trustworthiness (based on user ratings and social connections).

**3. Output:**

*   **Real-Time Assistance:** Information relevant to User A’s query delivered through a mobile app or voice assistant.
*   **Dynamic Social Network Visualization:** A temporary visualization of the synthesized social network, highlighting potential connectors and information sources.
*   **Proactive Assistance:** System proactively identifies potential needs based on location and activity (e.g., suggesting nearby restaurants when User A is near a train station).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function synthesizeSocialNetwork(userA_location, userA_query, userA_trustRadius) {
    nearbyUsers = getNearbyUsers(userA_location, userA_trustRadius)
    dynamicGraph = createGraph()

    for each userB in nearbyUsers {
        // Calculate weights based on proximity, activity overlap, and helpfulness
        proximityWeight = calculateProximityWeight(userA_location, userB_location)
        activityOverlapWeight = calculateActivityOverlapWeight(userA_query, userB_activity)
        helpfulnessWeight = userB.helpfulnessScore

        // Add edge to graph with calculated weight
        addEdge(dynamicGraph, userA, userB, proximityWeight * activityOverlapWeight * helpfulnessWeight)
    }

    // Propagate query through graph
    results = propagateQuery(dynamicGraph, userA_query)

    // Rank and filter results
    rankedResults = rankResults(results)

    return rankedResults
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Mobile device with GPS and internet connectivity.
*   Cloud server for data processing and machine learning.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Emergency assistance (finding nearby help during a disaster).
*   Real-time event information (finding people attending the same concert).
*   Personalized recommendations (finding nearby restaurants based on preferences).
*   Crowdsourced information gathering (collecting real-time traffic updates).
