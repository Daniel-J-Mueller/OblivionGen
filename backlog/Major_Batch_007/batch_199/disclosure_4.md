## Adaptive Propulsion Vectoring with Bio-Inspired Articulation

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple reversal of rotational directions and coordinate frame adjustments. Implement individual, rapid articulation of each propulsion unit – mimicking insect flight – to achieve nuanced control and maneuverability *even with multiple failures*.

**Specifications:**

*   **Propulsion Unit Design:** Each of the six propulsion mechanisms will be a gimbaled ducted fan. The gimbal will provide pitch, yaw, and roll control – independent of the main aerial vehicle attitude. The ducted fan itself will have variable pitch blades.
*   **Actuation:** High-speed, low-latency servo motors will control the gimbal angles and blade pitch. Redundant servo systems per propulsion unit are essential.
*   **Control System:**
    *   **Failure Detection:** Existing failure detection systems (from the provided patent) are maintained.
    *   **Vectoring Algorithm:** A novel algorithm based on bio-inspired insect flight control. This algorithm will determine the optimal gimbal angles and blade pitch for each propulsion unit to achieve desired movements (hover, pitch, roll, yaw, translation).
    *   **Redundancy Management:**  In case of a failure, the algorithm will dynamically re-allocate thrust vectors to maintain control. This will go beyond simply stopping failed units; *active* vectoring of remaining units will compensate. The algorithm will consider the location of failed units and prioritize stabilization.
    *   **Learning Component:** A reinforcement learning model will be integrated to improve vectoring efficiency and stability over time, adapting to different flight conditions and failure scenarios.
*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   High-performance flight controller with significant processing power.
    *   Advanced IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for accurate attitude and angular velocity estimation.
    *   High-bandwidth communication bus between flight controller and propulsion units.
    *   Lightweight, high-strength materials for gimbal and ducted fan construction.
*   **Pseudocode (Simplified Vectoring Algorithm):**

```
// Inputs:
// desired_thrust (vector3): Desired total thrust vector
// current_attitude (quaternion): Current vehicle attitude
// failed_units (list): List of failed propulsion unit indices
// unit_positions (list): 3D coordinates of each propulsion unit relative to vehicle center

// Outputs:
// individual_thrust_vectors (list): 3D thrust vectors for each propulsion unit
// individual_gimbal_angles (list): Gimbal angles (pitch, yaw, roll) for each propulsion unit

function calculate_thrust_vectors(desired_thrust, current_attitude, failed_units, unit_positions):
  remaining_units = [i for i in range(6) if i not in failed_units]
  
  // Calculate thrust distribution based on desired_thrust and unit positions
  thrust_distribution = distribute_thrust(desired_thrust, unit_positions, remaining_units)
  
  individual_thrust_vectors = []
  individual_gimbal_angles = []
  
  for i in remaining_units:
    // Calculate required thrust vector for this unit
    required_thrust = thrust_distribution[i]
    
    // Transform required thrust from vehicle frame to unit frame
    unit_thrust = rotate(required_thrust, current_attitude)
    
    // Calculate gimbal angles to align thrust with unit frame
    gimbal_angles = calculate_gimbal_angles(unit_thrust)
    
    individual_thrust_vectors.append(unit_thrust)
    individual_gimbal_angles.append(gimbal_angles)

  return individual_thrust_vectors, individual_gimbal_angles
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased resilience to multiple propulsion unit failures.
*   Improved maneuverability and agility.
*   Potential for more efficient flight.
*   Greater precision in hovering and landing.
*   Adaptability to unpredictable external forces.
