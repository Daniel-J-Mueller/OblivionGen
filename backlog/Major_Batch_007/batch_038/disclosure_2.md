## Adaptive Dialogue Context Shifting

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple token passing for continuation. Enable the device to *proactively* shift dialogue context based on inferred user emotional state and inferred task complexity, even *before* explicit user input dictates a change.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing device hardware is sufficient. Requires enhanced microphone array for better ambient audio analysis.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Emotional State Inferencer:*  Analyzes audio (prosody, tone, pauses) and potentially visual cues (if the device has a camera) to estimate user emotional state (e.g., frustration, boredom, excitement). Output: Confidence score for various emotional states.
    *   *Task Complexity Estimator:*  Analyzes the ongoing dialogue and any associated data (e.g., calendar entries, location data) to assess the complexity of the current task.  Factors include the number of steps required, the amount of information involved, and the level of user expertise presumed. Output: Complexity score.
    *   *Context Shift Manager:*  Combines emotional state and task complexity scores to determine if a context shift is warranted.  Uses a configurable rule set (e.g., “If frustration is high *and* task complexity is high, initiate a simplified instruction mode”).  Selects the appropriate context shift action.
    *   *Dynamic Prompt Generator:* Creates tailored prompts and responses based on the selected context shift action.  These prompts are designed to either de-escalate frustration, simplify instructions, provide additional assistance, or offer proactive support.
*   **Data Flow:**

    1.  User speech input.
    2.  Speech processed by existing speech-to-text and intent recognition.
    3.  *Parallel processing:*
        *   Emotional State Inferencer analyzes audio for emotional cues.
        *   Task Complexity Estimator assesses ongoing dialogue and associated data.
    4.  Context Shift Manager receives outputs from both inferencers.
    5.  Based on configurable rules, Context Shift Manager determines if a context shift is needed.
    6.  If a shift is needed, Context Shift Manager selects an appropriate action and sends instructions to the Dynamic Prompt Generator.
    7.  Dynamic Prompt Generator creates a tailored prompt/response.
    8.  The device responds to the user with the tailored prompt/response.
*   **Pseudocode (Context Shift Manager):**

    ```
    function determineContextShift(emotionalStateScore, taskComplexityScore, currentContext):
        if emotionalStateScore > frustrationThreshold and taskComplexityScore > complexityThreshold:
            newContext = "simplifiedInstructions"  // Or "provideHelp", "offerAlternatives"
        elif emotionalStateScore < boredomThreshold and taskComplexityScore < minimalComplexity:
            newContext = "proactiveSuggestions"
        else:
            newContext = currentContext

        return newContext
    ```

*   **Example Scenario:**

    User is attempting to set up a complex smart home automation routine. The device detects rising frustration (high emotionalStateScore) and recognizes the routine involves multiple steps and conditions (high taskComplexityScore).  The Context Shift Manager initiates a “simplifiedInstructions” context, prompting the device to provide step-by-step visual guidance alongside verbal instructions, breaking down the routine into smaller, more manageable tasks.
