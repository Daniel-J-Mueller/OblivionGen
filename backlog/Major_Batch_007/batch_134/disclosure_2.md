## Dynamic Environmental State Synthesis for Proactive Automation

**Concept:** Extend the declarative intent recognition to not just *react* to stated environmental conditions, but to *synthesize* likely future states and proactively adjust systems. This moves beyond simple command execution to anticipatory automation.

**Specs:**

1.  **State Vector Construction:**
    *   Input: Raw sensor data (temperature, humidity, light levels, audio input, video feed, network traffic, device states).
    *   Process:  A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) – is trained to map sensor inputs to a high-dimensional “state vector.” This vector represents the current environmental state.  The RNN is trained on historical sensor data and manually labeled environmental events (e.g., "morning routine," "evening relaxation," "cooking session").
    *   Output: A normalized state vector representing the current environment.

2.  **Predictive State Modeling:**
    *   Input: Current state vector, time-of-day, day-of-week, user calendar data (events, meetings), historical user behavior patterns.
    *   Process: A separate RNN (or a transformer network) is trained to *predict* future state vectors. The prediction horizon is configurable (e.g., 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 2 hours).  The model learns to anticipate changes based on time, context, and user behavior.  Monte Carlo tree search can be incorporated to explore multiple likely future state trajectories.
    *   Output: A probability distribution over likely future state vectors.

3.  **Action Policy Network:**
    *   Input: Predicted future state vectors (from step 2), user preferences (learned from past interactions), current system state (e.g., smart thermostat setting, lighting level, music volume).
    *   Process: A reinforcement learning (RL) agent (e.g., a Deep Q-Network or Proximal Policy Optimization) learns an action policy that maximizes a reward function. The reward function is designed to align with user preferences (e.g., comfort, energy efficiency, productivity).  The agent selects actions that proactively adjust system settings to optimize the predicted future state.
    *   Output: Recommended actions (e.g., “Increase thermostat temperature to 72 degrees,” “Dim living room lights,” “Start playing relaxing music”).

4.  **Declarative Intent Mapping & Refinement:**
    *   Input: User’s natural language input.
    *   Process: Existing NLP pipeline identifies declarative intent and associated state data. *However*, instead of directly executing the implied action, the system *integrates* this intent into the predictive model. For example, if the user says “I’m feeling cold,” the system does *not* immediately increase the thermostat. Instead, it updates its prediction of the user’s thermal comfort level and adjusts its action policy accordingly.  This creates a feedback loop where user input refines the system’s understanding of their preferences.
    *   Output:  Refined state data, updated action policy.

5. **Dynamic Reward Shaping:**

    * Input: User Feedback (Explicit Ratings or Implicit Behavioral Signals - e.g., overridden actions, manual adjustments).
    * Process: A meta-learning algorithm dynamically adjusts the reward function used by the RL agent (Step 4). This allows the system to quickly adapt to changing user preferences and learn more effective action policies.

**Pseudocode (Action Selection):**

```
function select_action(current_state, predicted_future_states, user_preferences):
  action = RL_agent.choose_action(predicted_future_states, user_preferences)
  return action
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Edge computing device (e.g., smart hub, dedicated processor) for real-time processing of sensor data and execution of machine learning models.
*   High-bandwidth network connection for data logging, model updates, and cloud-based training.
*   Suite of sensors (temperature, humidity, light, motion, audio, video).
