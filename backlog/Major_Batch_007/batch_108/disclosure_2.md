## Dynamic Symbol Table Replication & Conflict Resolution

**Concept:** Extend the symbol table functionality to a multi-tenant, geographically distributed service provider environment. Instead of a single, centralized symbol table (even a distributed one), create a system where each tenant (or group of tenants) maintains a *local* replica of the symbol table, dynamically syncing with a global "source of truth" and resolving conflicts intelligently.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Local Symbol Table (LST):** Each tenant or group has its own in-memory symbol table optimized for fast access.
*   **Global Symbol Table (GST):** A globally accessible, persistent store (e.g., a distributed key-value store) acts as the definitive source of all symbols and their values.
*   **Synchronization Agent (SA):** A component running within each tenant’s environment responsible for:
    *   **Pushing** local symbol updates to the GST.
    *   **Pulling** updates from the GST to the LST.
    *   **Conflict Detection:** Identifying scenarios where a symbol has been modified in both the LST and GST since the last sync.
    *   **Conflict Resolution:**  Applying a pre-defined or dynamically determined strategy to resolve conflicts.
*   **Conflict Resolution Strategies:**
    *   **Last Write Wins (LWW):** Simplest approach – the most recent update prevails.
    *   **Versioned Updates:** Symbols have version numbers. Conflicts are resolved by merging changes based on version history.
    *   **Semantic Merging:**  The system attempts to *understand* the type of symbol and merge changes intelligently (e.g., appending to a list, combining numeric values).  Requires a 'symbol type' metadata component.
    *   **Tenant Preference:**  A tenant can configure a preference for prioritizing its local changes or the global changes.
    *    **Manual Resolution:** Flag conflicts for administrator intervention.

**2. Data Structures:**

*   **Symbol Entry:**
    ```
    {
        symbol_name: string,
        value: any,  // String, Number, Function, Code, etc.
        version: integer,
        last_updated: timestamp,
        tenant_id: string, // Identifier for tenant that owns the record
        conflict_flag: boolean,
        resolution_strategy: string,
    }
    ```

**3. Synchronization Process:**

1.  **Local Update:** When a program modifies a symbol within its environment, the change is immediately reflected in the LST. The `version` number is incremented, the `last_updated` timestamp is updated, and the `tenant_id` is recorded.
2.  **Asynchronous Push:** The SA pushes the updated Symbol Entry to the GST asynchronously.
3.  **Periodic Pull:** The SA periodically pulls updates from the GST.
4.  **Conflict Detection:** During the pull, the SA compares the incoming Symbol Entry from the GST with the corresponding entry in the LST.
    *   If the `version` numbers match, no conflict.
    *   If the `version` numbers differ, a conflict is detected.
5.  **Conflict Resolution:** Based on the configured `resolution_strategy`, the SA applies the appropriate conflict resolution mechanism.
6.  **LST Update:** The LST is updated with the resolved Symbol Entry.

**4.  Pseudocode (SA – Conflict Resolution):**

```pseudocode
function resolveConflict(localSymbol, globalSymbol):
    if (globalSymbol.version > localSymbol.version):
        // Global update is newer – accept it.
        return globalSymbol
    else if (localSymbol.version > globalSymbol.version):
        // Local update is newer – accept it.
        return localSymbol
    else:
        // Version numbers are equal – potential concurrent update.
        if (resolutionStrategy == "semanticMerge"):
            mergedSymbol = semanticMerge(localSymbol, globalSymbol)
            return mergedSymbol
        else if (resolutionStrategy == "tenantPreference"):
            // Apply tenant’s configured preference.
            if (tenantPrefersLocal):
                return localSymbol
            else:
                return globalSymbol
        else:
            // Default – flag for manual resolution.
            flagForManualResolution(localSymbol, globalSymbol)
            return localSymbol // or globalSymbol – depends on policy
```

**5. Considerations:**

*   **Symbol Types:**  Defining and tracking symbol types is crucial for effective semantic merging.
*   **Concurrency Control:**  Employ appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions during synchronization.
*   **Scalability:**  Design the system to handle a large number of tenants and symbols.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  Ensure the system can handle failures of individual tenants or components.
*   **Versioning:** Using Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for symbol definitions can help with compatibility and conflict resolution.
