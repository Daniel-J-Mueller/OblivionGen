## Dynamic Media ‘Provenance’ & Adaptive Resolution Streaming

**Core Concept:** Extend the unique URL system to embed ‘provenance’ data *within* the URL itself, and utilize this data to dynamically adjust streamed resolution based on user context *and* media creation/modification history. This goes beyond simple CDN-based adaptive bitrate streaming.

**Specs:**

*   **URL Structure:**  Extend the existing URL scheme to include a ‘provenance block’ appended after the core file identifier.  This block is a comma-separated list of key-value pairs encoded using a lightweight, reversible encoding (e.g., Base64url).  Example: `.../image.jpg?provenance=creator:JohnDoe,date:2024-10-27T10:00:00Z,modifications:filterA:v1.2,compression:lossy:80`

*   **Provenance Data:** The provenance block contains:
    *   `creator`:  The original author/device that captured/created the media.
    *   `date`: Timestamp of initial creation.
    *   `modifications`:  A log of all significant modifications, including the type of modification (e.g., filter, compression, resizing) and the version of the tool/algorithm used.  This must be append-only.
    *   `geo`: Geo location data where the media was created
    *   `device`: Device identifying information
    *   `license`: License details or restrictions
    *   `tags`: User defined tags.

*   **Client-Side Agent:**  A lightweight agent embedded within the media player or browser.
    *   **URL Parsing:** Parses the provenance block from the URL.
    *   **Contextual Analysis:**  Gathers user context (network speed, device capabilities, user preferences, geographic location) *and* media provenance data.
    *   **Resolution Adjustment:** Based on the combined contextual and provenance analysis, dynamically adjusts the streamed resolution.  
        *   **Priority Based Adjustment**: Rules prioritize adjusting resolution based on provenance. For example: prioritize delivering highest resolution to original creator's device, or a device verified as owning the content.
        *   **Trust Based Adjustment**: Higher trust (verified provenance) = higher potential resolution.
        *   **Modification Penalty**:  Each modification to the media applies a resolution penalty.  More heavily modified content receives lower resolution. (This incentivizes original content).
        *   **Geo Location Penalty**: Apply a penalty when accessing media from a region that conflicts with a geographic restriction
    *   **Data Reporting:**  Anonymously reports usage data (resolution levels, provenance analysis results) to a central server for further optimization.

*   **Server-Side Infrastructure:**
    *   **Provenance Database:** A database to store and verify provenance information.
    *   **Dynamic Encoding Pipeline:** A pipeline to dynamically encode media at different resolutions based on the client request and provenance data.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Agent – Resolution Adjustment):**

```
function adjustResolution(url, userContext, provenanceData) {
  baseResolution = determineBaseResolution(userContext.networkSpeed, userContext.deviceCapabilities)
  resolutionPenalty = 0

  //Apply Provenance Penalties
  if (provenanceData.modifications != null) {
    resolutionPenalty += provenanceData.modifications.length * 0.1 //10% penalty per modification
  }
  if (provenanceData.geo != null && userContext.location != provenanceData.geo) {
    resolutionPenalty += 0.2 //penalty for region conflict
  }

  //Apply Trust Level
  trustLevel = verifyProvenance(provenanceData)
  if (trustLevel == "low") {
      resolutionPenalty += 0.1
  }

  finalResolution = baseResolution * (1 - resolutionPenalty)
  finalResolution = clamp(finalResolution, minResolution, maxResolution)

  requestMedia(url, finalResolution)
}
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond standard adaptive bitrate streaming by incorporating *media history and trust* into the resolution selection process.  It introduces a ‘digital lineage’ for media, allowing for more nuanced and intelligent content delivery. It also allows for the incentivization of original media content by subtly adjusting streamed quality based on editing history.
