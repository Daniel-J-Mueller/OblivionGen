## Dynamic Spectrum Harvesting for E-Reader Power

**Core Concept:** Instead of solely relying on ambient visible and near-infrared light, integrate a tunable metamaterial layer *above* the e-reader display to actively harvest energy from a wider electromagnetic spectrum, including radio frequencies (RF) and potentially even microwave frequencies. This energy is then converted and fed into the existing photovoltaic system, supplementing power generation.

**Components:**

1.  **Tunable Metamaterial Layer:** A transparent or semi-transparent layer comprised of metamaterial elements (e.g., split-ring resonators, wire antennas). This layer’s resonant frequencies are dynamically adjusted via an integrated micro-controller and small voltage application, shifting the spectrum it most efficiently harvests.
2.  **RF/Microwave to DC Converter:** A highly efficient rectifier circuit designed to convert harvested RF/microwave energy into DC voltage suitable for charging the battery. Multiple, small converters distributed across the display area would minimize energy loss.
3.  **Micro-Controller & Sensor Suite:**  A low-power micro-controller manages the metamaterial tuning and monitors the surrounding electromagnetic environment. Sensors detect signal strength and frequencies, guiding the metamaterial to optimize harvesting. Also monitors battery state of charge.
4.  **Transparent Conductive Layer:** A transparent conductive layer between the metamaterial and the existing light guide system to efficiently direct converted DC power.
5.  **Adaptive Filtering:** Algorithm running on the micro-controller which filters out noise and interference from the harvested signal.

**Operational Specs:**

*   **Metamaterial Tuning Range:** 500 MHz – 6 GHz (adjustable via software).
*   **RF/Microwave to DC Conversion Efficiency:** Target >60%.
*   **Power Harvesting Mode Selection:**
    *   **Passive:** Continuously scan for and harvest available RF/Microwave energy.
    *   **Active:** Prioritize harvesting signals from known sources (e.g., Wi-Fi routers, cellular base stations) based on user-defined preferences.
*   **Display Integration:** Metamaterial layer integrated *above* the clear cover layer, seamlessly blending into the e-reader's aesthetic.
*   **Energy Management:** Intelligent power distribution algorithm prioritizes harvested energy for powering the display and other essential functions. Surplus energy stored in the battery.

**Pseudocode (Micro-Controller Logic):**

```
Initialize sensors and metamaterial driver
while (true) {
    Scan electromagnetic spectrum (0.5 GHz – 6 GHz)
    Identify dominant signal frequencies
    Adjust metamaterial resonance to match dominant frequencies
    Convert harvested RF/Microwave energy to DC voltage
    Monitor battery state of charge
    If (battery < 20%) {
        Prioritize power to display
    } else {
        Store surplus energy in battery
    }
    Adaptive filtering to remove noise
}
```

**Novelty & Potential:** This system goes beyond passively harvesting ambient light. It *actively* seeks and captures a broader range of electromagnetic energy, dramatically increasing power generation potential. The dynamic tuning allows adaptation to varying environments, maximizing energy capture. It's potentially a true ‘off-grid’ power solution for e-readers and other low-power devices.
