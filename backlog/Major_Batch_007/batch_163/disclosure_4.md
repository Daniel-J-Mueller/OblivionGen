## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Integration – “Sensory Halo”

**Concept:** Expand the visual indicator system into a localized haptic feedback system, creating a ‘Sensory Halo’ around the wearer’s head to convey information beyond simple visual cues. This enhances awareness without requiring direct visual attention, improving situational awareness and reducing cognitive load.

**Specifications:**

*   **Haptic Actuator Array:** Integrate an array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or similar) within the temples and brow sections of the HMWD frame. These actuators will be positioned to provide tactile stimulation to specific points around the wearer's temples, forehead, and potentially cheekbones. Density: 1 actuator per 5mm².
*   **Haptic Mapping System:** Develop a software system to map specific device states/conditions to unique haptic patterns.  Examples:
    *   Incoming call: Pulsating sensation on both temples.
    *   Low battery: Slow, rhythmic tapping on the forehead.
    *   Navigation cue (turn right): Brief, directional vibration on the right temple.
    *   Active microphone: Constant, subtle pressure on cheekbones.
*   **Intensity Control:** Implement adjustable intensity levels for haptic feedback. This will allow users to customize the strength of the sensations to their preference and environmental conditions. Control via onboard button/touch control, or companion app.
*   **Ambient Vibration Cancellation:** Integrate a small accelerometer and noise cancellation algorithm. This will analyze ambient vibrations and attempt to filter them out, ensuring that the haptic feedback remains clear and distinct.
*   **Combined Visual/Haptic Output:** The system will operate in conjunction with the existing visual indicator. Haptic feedback can be used as a primary notification method, while visual cues serve as supplementary information or confirmation.
*   **Software Interface:** A developer API to allow third-party applications to integrate with the haptic feedback system.
*   **Power Management:** Utilize low-power actuators and intelligent power management algorithms to minimize battery drain.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Control):**

```
// Function: UpdateHapticFeedback(deviceState, ambientLightValue)

function UpdateHapticFeedback(deviceState, ambientLightValue) {

  //Determine base intensity based on ambient light (lower light = higher intensity)
  baseIntensity = 100 - ambientLightValue; // Scale ambient light to intensity range

  //Map device state to haptic pattern and intensity modifiers
  switch (deviceState) {
    case "incomingCall":
      pattern = "pulsate";
      intensityModifier = 1.2;
      break;
    case "lowBattery":
      pattern = "tap";
      intensityModifier = 0.8;
      break;
    case "navigationTurnRight":
      pattern = "directionalVibrateRight";
      intensityModifier = 1.0;
      break;
    case "microphoneActive":
      pattern = "constantPressure";
      intensityModifier = 0.5;
      break;
    default:
      pattern = "none";
      intensityModifier = 0.0;
  }

  //Calculate final intensity
  finalIntensity = baseIntensity * intensityModifier;

  //Clamp intensity to valid range (0-100)
  finalIntensity = Math.min(Math.max(finalIntensity, 0), 100);

  //Activate actuators based on pattern and intensity
  ActivateActuators(pattern, finalIntensity);
}
```

**Materials:**

*   Frame: Lightweight polymer or carbon fiber
*   Actuators: Piezoelectric micro-actuators
*   Sensors: Accelerometer, Ambient Light Sensor
*   Covering: Soft, hypoallergenic material

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Biofeedback integration (e.g., subtly vibrate based on heart rate).
*   Directional audio coupling (using bone conduction alongside haptic feedback).
*   Customizable haptic patterns via companion app.
