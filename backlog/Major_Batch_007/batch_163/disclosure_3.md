## Temporal Content Stacking & Predictive Rendering

**Concept:** Extend the contextual retrieval to encompass not just immediately surrounding browsed content, but to construct a layered "temporal stack" of content versions *and* predicted future content states, enabling a richer interactive experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure:** A multi-layered data structure (“Temporal Stack”) stored per user/session. Each layer represents a point in time (or a predicted time). Layers contain:
    *   Full rendered page state (DOM, CSS, images, video frames - compressed).
    *   Associated metadata: Timestamp, user actions leading to the state, confidence score (for predicted states).
    *   "Intent Vectors": A numerical representation of the user's likely intent at that state (derived from actions, search terms, time spent on elements).

*   **Prediction Engine:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on user browsing history, predicting likely future page states based on:
    *   Current page state.
    *   Intent Vector.
    *   Time of day, user location, and other contextual factors.
    *   Output: Multiple predicted page states with associated confidence scores.

*   **Interactive Rendering:** A UI enabling users to navigate *through time* within their browsing session.
    *   Controls:  "Rewind", "Fast Forward", "Predict" (step through historical/predicted states).
    *   "Blend Mode":  Option to overlay historical/predicted states onto the current state with adjustable transparency.
    *   "What If" Exploration:  User can interact with a predicted state as if it were the current state, triggering further predictions based on those interactions.

*   **Search Integration:** The existing search functionality expands to include temporal filtering.  
    *   Search queries can specify a date/time range *or* a “confidence level” for predictions. 
    *   Results display not just the matching content, but a timeline showing its evolution over time.

*   **Pseudocode (Prediction Step):**

```
function predictNextState(currentState, intentVector, timeContext):
  // Input: Current page state, user intent, time of day
  // Output: Predicted next page state with confidence score

  inputData = [currentState, intentVector, timeContext]
  prediction = RNN.predict(inputData) // RNN outputs multiple candidate states
  
  // Filter and score predictions based on various factors (e.g., confidence, coherence)
  scoredPredictions = filterAndScore(prediction)
  
  bestPrediction = selectBest(scoredPredictions) // Select the most likely state
  
  return bestPrediction
```

*   **Hardware Considerations:** Requires significant storage capacity to store historical and predicted states.  Edge caching and compression are crucial.  GPU acceleration for rendering and prediction is highly recommended.
