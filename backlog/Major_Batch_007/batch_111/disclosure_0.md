## Dynamic Focal Point Array for Volumetric Capture

**Concept:** Extend the multi-ToF approach to enable real-time volumetric capture and rendering, creating a dynamic light field. Instead of simply orienting a second ToF camera *to* an object, the system actively builds a spatially distributed array of focused depth measurements.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Replace the single second ToF camera with a 3x3 (minimum, scalable) array of micro-ToF cameras. Each camera unit is physically gimbaled, allowing for independent pan, tilt, and zoom adjustments.
*   **Illumination Matrix:** Supplement the single light source with a corresponding array of micro-emitters, positioned to coincide with the ToF camera array. Each emitter is individually controllable for intensity and modulation frequency.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated FPGA/ASIC for real-time processing of depth data from the array and controlling the emitter/camera array.
*   **Control Algorithm:**
    1.  **Initial Scan:** The primary, wide-FoV ToF camera identifies potential objects/regions of interest.
    2.  **Focus Allocation:** The processing unit allocates “focus points” within the scene. These points aren’t necessarily *on* a detected object initially, but define a volumetric grid to be measured.
    3.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Each micro-ToF unit in the array is dynamically steered (pan/tilt/zoom) to converge on its assigned focus point. 
    4.  **Phase-Locked Modulation:** Each emitter/camera pair is phase-locked. The emitter’s modulation frequency is adjusted to optimize signal return for the specific distance to the focus point.
    5.  **Volumetric Reconstruction:** Depth data from all array elements is fused to create a dynamic point cloud or voxel grid representing the scene.
    6.  **Rendering Pipeline:** A real-time rendering pipeline generates images from arbitrary viewpoints within the captured volume.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
//Initialization
array_size = 3x3
emitter_array = create_emitter_array(array_size)
camera_array = create_camera_array(array_size)

while (true):
    //Object Detection (Wide FoV)
    object_data = wide_fov_camera.capture_data()
    objects = detect_objects(object_data)

    //Focus Point Allocation
    focus_points = allocate_focus_points(objects, scene_volume)

    //Array Control Loop
    for each focus_point in focus_points:
        for each camera_unit in camera_array:
            //Calculate Pan/Tilt/Zoom based on camera_unit position & focus_point
            pan, tilt, zoom = calculate_steering_angles(camera_unit, focus_point)

            camera_unit.set_steering(pan, tilt, zoom)

            //Calculate modulation frequency for distance to focus_point
            modulation_frequency = calculate_modulation_frequency(focus_point.distance)
            emitter_array[corresponding_emitter].set_frequency(modulation_frequency)

        //Capture depth data from each camera unit
        depth_data = camera_array.capture_data()

        //Fuse depth data to create volumetric reconstruction
        reconstruct_volume(depth_data)

        //Render image from desired viewpoint
        image = render_image(viewpoint)

        //Display Image
        display_image(image)
```

**Potential Applications:** Real-time holographic displays, immersive VR/AR experiences, advanced robotics (accurate 3D scene understanding), high-fidelity remote collaboration.
