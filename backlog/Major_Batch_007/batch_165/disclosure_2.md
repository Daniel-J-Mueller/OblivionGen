## Dynamic Content Weighting for Similarity Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the similarity scoring system to incorporate dynamic weighting of content portions based on user interaction and inferred importance. This moves beyond static, predefined content divisions and allows the system to learn which parts of an item *actually* drive perceived similarity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Feature Engineering:**

*   **User Interaction Tracking:** Monitor user behavior on item detail pages. Specifically track:
    *   *Time Spent on Content Portion:* How long does a user spend viewing a specific section (chapter preview, table of contents, preface, etc.)?
    *   *Scroll Depth:* How far down does a user scroll within a content portion?
    *   *Click-Through Rate:* If content portions link to more detailed views, track click-through rates.
    *   *Highlighting/Annotation:* If the system supports highlighting or annotation, track which content portions receive the most attention.
*   **Content Portion Granularity:**  Dynamically define content portions. Initially, use the sections outlined in the patent (chapters, preface, TOC).  But allow the system to *subdivide* these further, based on natural language processing (sentence or paragraph level).
*   **Feature Vector Creation:**  For each content portion, create a feature vector including:
    *   *Static Weight:* Initial weight assigned based on content type (e.g., preface = higher initial weight).
    *   *Interaction Score:* Calculated from user interaction data (weighted average of time spent, scroll depth, clicks, highlights).
    *   *Content Type:* Categorical variable (chapter, preface, TOC, etc.).
    *   *Content Length:*  Number of words/characters.

**2.  Weight Adjustment Algorithm:**

*   **Reinforcement Learning Approach:** Employ a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to adjust content weights.
    *   *State:*  Current feature vector for a specific content portion.
    *   *Action:* Increase or decrease the weight of the content portion.
    *   *Reward:*  Reward signal based on perceived user satisfaction. This can be indirectly inferred from:
        *   *Time on Page:* Longer time on the item detail page suggests higher satisfaction.
        *   *Purchase Rate:* Higher purchase rate for items with specific weight configurations.
        *   *Explicit User Feedback:*  "Was this comparison helpful?" style feedback.
*   **Weight Decay:** Implement a weight decay mechanism to prevent overly dominant content portions.
*   **Global Normalization:**  Normalize content weights after each adjustment to ensure they sum to 1.

**3. Similarity Score Calculation:**

*   **Weighted Sub-Score:**  Calculate the sub-score for each pair of corresponding content portions by multiplying the similarity metric (e.g., Levenshtein distance) by the dynamically adjusted weight of that content portion.
*   **Overall Similarity:**  Sum the weighted sub-scores to obtain the overall similarity score between the two versions.

**4. System Architecture Additions:**

*   **Interaction Tracking Module:**  Captures user interaction data.
*   **Weight Adjustment Engine:**  Implements the RL algorithm and weight decay mechanisms.
*   **Data Storage:**  Stores user interaction data, content features, and dynamically adjusted weights.
*   **API Integration:**  Provides an API for accessing dynamically adjusted weights and calculating similarity scores.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
FOR EACH content_portion IN item_version_1, item_version_2:
    content_portion.weight = INITIAL_WEIGHT // Based on content type
    content_portion.interaction_score = 0

// User Interaction Loop
ON user_interaction_event:
    content_portion = event.target
    content_portion.interaction_score += calculate_score(event)

// Weight Adjustment Loop (Periodic)
FOR EACH content_portion IN item_version_1, item_version_2:
    reward = calculate_reward(content_portion) // Based on user behavior
    Q_value = Q_learning(content_portion, reward)
    content_portion.weight = update_weight(content_portion.weight, Q_value)
    apply_weight_decay(content_portion.weight)
    normalize_weights()

// Similarity Calculation
overall_similarity = 0
FOR EACH pair OF corresponding content_portions:
    sub_score = calculate_similarity(content_portion_1, content_portion_2) * content_portion_1.weight
    overall_similarity += sub_score
```

This approach allows the system to evolve its understanding of what constitutes similarity, providing more relevant and accurate results to users. It moves beyond pre-defined structures and adapts to user behaviour, maximizing the effectiveness of the similarity scoring system.
