## Dynamic Audio Scene Reconstruction via Metadata-Driven Spatialization

**Concept:** Augment the metadata encoding scheme to not just *describe* audio properties, but to facilitate the reconstruction of a 3D audio scene. Instead of simply tagging audio with properties like "near/far speech," embed data enabling spatial audio rendering.

**Specs:**

*   **Metadata Structure:** Expand the metadata frame. Add fields for:
    *   `Azimuth`: Angle in degrees (0-360) representing the source direction.
    *   `Elevation`: Angle in degrees (-90 to +90) representing the source elevation.
    *   `Distance`: Estimated distance of the source from the microphone (in meters).
    *   `ReverberationProfileIndex`: Index referencing a pre-calculated reverberation profile (e.g., small room, large hall).
    *   `OcclusionMask`: Binary mask indicating frequency bands occluded by objects in the scene.
*   **Encoding Scheme:**
    *   Prioritize `Azimuth`, `Elevation`, and `Distance`. These are critical for spatialization.
    *   Employ variable bit depth based on the accuracy required. Higher accuracy = more bits.
    *   Use delta encoding for consecutive frames.  Only transmit changes to spatial parameters, reducing bandwidth.
    *   If `Distance` data is unavailable, infer it using the audio sample amplitude and microphone characteristics.
*   **Audio Processing Application Integration:**
    *   The application receives the encoded audio frame *and* decodes the spatial metadata.
    *   Implement a spatial audio renderer.  Utilize Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) appropriate for the listener.
    *   Apply the HRTFs and distance attenuation to each audio source based on the decoded metadata.
    *   Apply the selected reverberation profile to create a realistic soundstage.
    *   Implement the occlusion mask.  Filter frequency bands blocked by virtual objects in the scene.
*   **Hardware Considerations:**
    *   Microphone array: Incorporate a multi-microphone array to improve source localization accuracy. The processed data feeds into the metadata encoding.
    *   DSP: Utilize a dedicated Digital Signal Processor (DSP) for real-time spatial audio rendering.
*   **Pseudocode (Audio Processing Application):**

```
function decodeAndRender(encodedFrame):
    headerData = extractHeader(encodedFrame)
    versionTypeData = extractVersionTypeData(encodedFrame)
    payloadData = extractPayloadData(encodedFrame)
    metadata = decodeMetadata(payloadData, versionTypeData, headerData)
    azimuth = metadata.azimuth
    elevation = metadata.elevation
    distance = metadata.distance
    reverbProfileIndex = metadata.reverbProfileIndex
    occlusionMask = metadata.occlusionMask
    audioSamples = extractAudioSamples(encodedFrame)
    reverbProfile = loadReverbProfile(reverbProfileIndex)
    spatializedAudio = applyHRTF(audioSamples, azimuth, elevation, distance)
    reverberatedAudio = applyReverb(spatializedAudio, reverbProfile)
    occludedAudio = applyOcclusion(reverberatedAudio, occlusionMask)
    output occludedAudio
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond simply *describing* audio to *reconstructing* the audio scene for a more immersive experience. Leveraging metadata for full 3D audio rendering, rather than relying solely on signal processing at the receiving end. The occlusion mask adds a level of realism not typically found in metadata-driven audio systems.
