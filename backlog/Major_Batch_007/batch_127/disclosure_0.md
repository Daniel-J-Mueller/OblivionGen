## Adaptive Frequency Masking & Predictive Band Selection

**Concept:** Dynamically create a “frequency mask” based on observed network congestion and user behavior, *before* initiating a band scan. This pre-emptive filtering drastically reduces scan time and power consumption, while also improving connection reliability.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Signal Congestion Monitoring:** Continuously monitor signal strength and quality across a broad spectrum of frequencies, even when not actively attempting connection. Utilize a low-power receiver for constant background scanning. (Duty cycle configurable).
*   **User Behavior Profiling:** Track user location, time of day, commonly used applications, and historical network connection patterns.  Store this data locally (encrypted) and/or transmit anonymized data to a cloud service for aggregated analysis.
*   **Crowdsourced Network Data:** Incorporate anonymized network performance data from other users in the vicinity (opt-in required). This data can include reported congestion levels, signal quality, and available bandwidth.

**2. Frequency Mask Generator:**

*   **Congestion Mapping:** Based on the acquired data, create a dynamic map of frequency congestion levels.  Assign a “congestion score” to each frequency band.
*   **Behavioral Prediction:** Predict the most likely frequency bands required based on user behavior, location, and time of day.
*   **Mask Creation:** Generate a “frequency mask” that prioritizes less congested, predicted bands.  The mask is a weighted list of frequencies, indicating the probability of a successful connection. This mask *reduces* the number of frequencies the device needs to scan.

**3. Adaptive Band Scanner:**

*   **Mask-Guided Scan:** Initiate a band scan *only* across the frequencies defined in the mask. Scan order is determined by the mask’s weighting.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously monitor scan results and adjust the mask in real-time. If a band proves unexpectedly congested, it’s de-prioritized. If a previously masked band exhibits strong signal strength, it’s added to the scan.
*   **Parallel Scanning (Hardware Dependent):** If hardware permits, scan multiple prioritized frequencies in parallel to further reduce scan time.

**4. Predictive Band Selection Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
function select_bands(location, time, user_profile, congestion_map):
  #Calculate a base score for each band
  for band in all_bands:
    base_score = 0
    #Location based preference
    if band is preferred_in_location(location):
      base_score += 50
    #Time of day preference
    if band is preferred_at_time(time):
      base_score += 20
    #User profile preference
    if band is used_by_user(user_profile):
      base_score += 30

    #Adjust score based on congestion map
    congestion_score = congestion_map[band]  #lower is better
    base_score -= congestion_score * 10

    weighted_bands[band] = base_score

  #Sort bands by weighted score
  sorted_bands = sort(weighted_bands, descending=True)

  #Select top N bands for scanning (N configurable)
  selected_bands = sorted_bands[:N]

  return selected_bands
```

**5. Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires a flexible radio transceiver capable of rapidly switching between frequencies.
*   Low-power receiver for background signal monitoring.
*   Sufficient processing power for real-time data analysis and mask generation.
*   Secure storage for user profile data.
