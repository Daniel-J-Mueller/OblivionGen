## Dynamic Metric Contextualization with Temporal Drift Detection

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Augment the existing metric query system with a dynamic contextualization layer that analyzes temporal drift in metric data and automatically adjusts query parameters to maintain relevance and accuracy. The system proactively identifies shifts in baseline metric behavior and modifies queries *before* anomalies are flagged, offering predictive alerting and improved data interpretation.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Temporal Drift Analyzer (TDA):** A dedicated module responsible for monitoring incoming metric streams. TDA employs statistical methods (e.g., change point detection, Kalman filtering, EWMA charts) to identify deviations from established baseline behavior. Output is a ‘drift score’ indicating the magnitude and direction of change for each metric.
*   **Contextualization Engine (CE):** CE receives the drift score from TDA and dynamically adjusts query parameters. These parameters can include:
    *   **Thresholds:** Automatically adjust alert thresholds based on detected drift, preventing false positives and increasing sensitivity to genuine anomalies.
    *   **Aggregation Intervals:** Modify the time window over which metrics are aggregated, accommodating changing data rates and patterns.
    *   **Dimension Filters:** Introduce or remove filters on dimension identifiers to focus on relevant data subsets, especially in scenarios where data characteristics change over time.
    *   **Function Calls:** Dynamically select different processing functions based on detected drift. For example, switching from a simple average to a weighted moving average if recent data has more significance.
*   **Query Rewriter:** A module that intercepts incoming queries and modifies them based on the recommendations from the CE.
*   **Historical Context Store:** A database that stores historical metric data and corresponding drift scores, enabling the CE to learn and improve its contextualization strategies over time.

**III. Data Flow:**

1.  Metric data streams into the system.
2.  TDA analyzes the data and calculates drift scores.
3.  CE receives the drift scores and determines optimal query adjustments.
4.  Query Rewriter intercepts incoming queries.
5.  Query Rewriter applies the CE’s recommendations to the queries.
6.  Modified queries are executed against the data sources.
7.  Results are returned to the user or alerting system.
8.  Historical data and drift scores are stored in the Historical Context Store.

**IV. Pseudocode (CE - Determine Query Adjustments):**

```
function determine_query_adjustments(metric_name, drift_score, current_query):
  if drift_score > threshold_high:
    // Significant positive drift
    new_threshold = current_query.threshold * drift_multiplier
    new_aggregation_interval = current_query.aggregation_interval / drift_factor
    new_query = update_query(current_query, threshold=new_threshold, aggregation_interval=new_aggregation_interval)

  elif drift_score < threshold_low:
    // Significant negative drift
    new_threshold = current_query.threshold / drift_multiplier
    new_aggregation_interval = current_query.aggregation_interval * drift_factor
    new_query = update_query(current_query, threshold=new_threshold, aggregation_interval=new_aggregation_interval)

  else:
    // No significant drift
    new_query = current_query

  return new_query
```

**V. Implementation Notes:**

*   The ‘drift multiplier’ and ‘drift factor’ values should be configurable and adjustable based on the specific characteristics of each metric.
*   Machine learning models can be used to predict future drift and proactively adjust queries.
*   The system should be designed to handle high-volume data streams with low latency.
*   A user interface should be provided to allow administrators to monitor drift scores and configure system parameters.
*   Consider incorporating user feedback to refine the contextualization strategies over time.
