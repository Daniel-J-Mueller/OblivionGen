## Adaptive CDN Thresholding via Predictive Network Congestion

**Concept:** Extend the existing fraud detection system by dynamically adjusting fraud thresholds based on *predicted* network congestion, rather than solely reacting to current conditions or historical data. This allows for more nuanced fraud detection, reducing false positives during legitimate peak traffic and improving detection during lower-usage fraud attempts.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Congestion Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time CDN log data (requests/second, bandwidth utilization per edge node, geographic distribution of requests), historical CDN performance data (daily/weekly/monthly traffic patterns), and external data sources (e.g., internet exchange point data, major event schedules).
*   **Processing:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM neural network) to predict future network congestion levels for each CDN edge node. Model should consider seasonality, trends, and external events. Output is a congestion score (0-100) for each node, representing predicted likelihood of congestion.
*   **Output:** A real-time map of predicted CDN congestion levels, updated every minute.

**2. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**

*   **Input:** Predicted congestion scores from the Predictive Congestion Module, current fraud thresholds, existing fraud scores for distributions.
*   **Processing:** Implement a rule-based system or a machine learning model to adjust fraud thresholds dynamically.
    *   **Rule-Based Example:**
        *   If congestion score > 80: Lower fraud threshold by X%.
        *   If congestion score < 20: Raise fraud threshold by Y%.
    *   **ML-Based Approach:** Train a model to predict the optimal fraud threshold based on current congestion, historical data, and recent fraud patterns.
*   **Output:** Updated fraud thresholds for each CDN edge node or distribution.

**3. Integration with Existing System:**

*   Modify the existing fraud detection service to ingest the dynamically adjusted fraud thresholds.
*   Log all threshold adjustments for auditing and model improvement.
*   Implement A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of the dynamic thresholding system.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop (executed every minute)

1.  Get CDN Log Data
2.  Get Historical CDN Data
3.  Get External Event Data
4.  Predict Congestion Scores (using Time-Series Model) for each edge node
5.  For Each Edge Node:
    a.  Get Current Fraud Threshold
    b.  If Congestion Score > 80:
        Lower Threshold by X%
    Else If Congestion Score < 20:
        Raise Threshold by Y%
    End If
6.  Update Fraud Detection Service with New Thresholds
7.  Log Threshold Adjustments
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   High-resolution CDN log data (requests/second, bandwidth usage, geographic locations, etc.)
*   Historical CDN performance data (daily/weekly/monthly traffic patterns)
*   External event data (major event schedules, public holidays, etc.)

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Sufficient compute resources to run the time-series forecasting model and the dynamic threshold adjustment system.
*   Scalable data storage for CDN logs and historical data.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced false positives during legitimate peak traffic.
*   Improved fraud detection during lower-usage fraud attempts.
*   More adaptive and resilient fraud detection system.
*   Potential for automated optimization of CDN performance.
