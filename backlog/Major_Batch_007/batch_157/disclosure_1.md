## Adaptive Key Rotation with Behavioral Profiling

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Behavioral Analysis Engine (BAE)
*   **Data Sources:** System logs (access attempts, data types accessed, time-based patterns), network traffic analysis (data volume, destination IPs), cryptographic key usage metrics (frequency, algorithm, data size encrypted).
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Dedicated processing unit (GPU acceleration recommended) for real-time analysis, high-bandwidth network interface.
*   **Software Requirements:** Machine learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch), secure enclave for key storage, intrusion detection system integration.
*   **Key Management System (KMS) Integration:** API for requesting key rotations based on BAE output.

**Innovation Description:**

The system continuously profiles key usage *behavior* rather than solely relying on pre-defined usage limits. This addresses scenarios where legitimate, but unusual, activity might trigger false positives under strict policy enforcement. 

**Operation:**

1.  **Baseline Establishment:** During initial operation, the BAE establishes a behavioral baseline for each key, capturing typical access patterns, data types accessed, and time-based trends.  This baseline is stored securely.

2.  **Real-time Monitoring:** The BAE monitors key usage in real-time, comparing current activity against the established baseline.  Statistical anomaly detection algorithms identify deviations from normal behavior.  

3.  **Risk Scoring:** Deviations are assigned a risk score based on the magnitude and frequency of the anomaly, and the sensitivity of the data being accessed.  Multiple anomalies are aggregated to create a composite risk score.

4.  **Adaptive Key Rotation:**
    *   If the risk score exceeds a predefined threshold, the system *automatically* triggers a key rotation request to the KMS. 
    *   The rotation occurs *before* any malicious activity can fully materialize.
    *   The system logs the reason for the rotation (behavioral anomaly) for audit and analysis.

5.  **Dynamic Baseline Adjustment:** The baseline is *continuously* updated to reflect evolving usage patterns. This prevents legitimate changes in behavior from triggering false positives.  The update process uses a weighted moving average, prioritizing recent data.

**Pseudocode (BAE Core):**

```
function analyzeKeyUsage(keyID, eventData):
  # eventData contains timestamp, access type, data size, destination IP
  # Fetch historical baseline data for keyID
  baseline = fetchBaseline(keyID)

  # Calculate anomaly score based on deviation from baseline
  anomalyScore = calculateAnomaly(eventData, baseline)

  # Update composite risk score for keyID
  riskScore = updateRiskScore(keyID, anomalyScore)

  # Check if risk score exceeds threshold
  if riskScore > threshold:
    # Request key rotation from KMS
    requestKeyRotation(keyID)
    logEvent("Key rotation triggered due to behavioral anomaly")

  # Update baseline with new event data
  updateBaseline(keyID, eventData)
end function
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems focus on static usage limits. This system introduces *dynamic* adaptation based on behavioral profiling, providing a more granular and proactive defense against key compromise.  The continuous baseline adjustment and risk score aggregation enhance accuracy and reduce false positives.  The use of behavioral analysis adds a layer of security beyond traditional policy enforcement.
