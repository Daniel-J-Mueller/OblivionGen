## Adaptive Telemetry - Predictive Summarization & Pre-emptive Data Shaping

**Concept:** Shift from *reacting* to telemetry congestion by proactively shaping and summarizing data *before* transmission bottlenecks occur, leveraging predictive analytics on client-side data characteristics and network conditions.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive Congestion Module (Client-Side):**

*   **Data Profiler:** Continuously analyzes outgoing log data, tracking:
    *   Metric types & frequencies
    *   Data cardinality (unique values)
    *   Data volume per time interval
    *   Correlation between metrics
*   **Network Monitor:** Monitors real-time network conditions (latency, packet loss, bandwidth) via periodic probes and historical data.  Integrates with OS network stats.
*   **Prediction Engine:** Uses a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) trained on historical data from the Data Profiler & Network Monitor to predict potential telemetry congestion *before* it manifests.  Outputs a “Congestion Risk Score” (0-100).

**2. Adaptive Summarization Engine (Client-Side):**

*   **Summarization Profile Library:** Stores pre-defined summarization configurations for different metric types and congestion risk levels.  (e.g., High risk for numerical metrics – exponential histograms with fewer bins; Medium risk for string metrics – approximate distinct count (HyperLogLog) with reduced accuracy; Low risk - full data transmission).
*   **Dynamic Configuration:**  The Predictive Congestion Module adjusts the summarization profile in real-time based on the Congestion Risk Score.
*   **Data Shaping:**  Applies the selected summarization profile to the outgoing log data *before* transmission.  This includes:
    *   Aggregating data
    *   Reducing precision
    *   Using approximate algorithms
    *   Filtering low-value data (based on pre-defined rules).

**3.  Server-Side Adaptation & Feedback:**

*   **Summarization Profile Registry:** Server maintains a registry of supported summarization profiles and their associated accuracy/compression tradeoffs.
*   **Client Profile Negotiation:** Clients and server negotiate the optimal summarization profile during handshake or via periodic API calls.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Server provides feedback to clients on the effectiveness of their summarization strategies (e.g., "Increase the number of histogram bins for metric X" or "Reduce precision for metric Y").  This enables clients to refine their data shaping strategies over time.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// Initialization
dataProfiler = new DataProfiler()
networkMonitor = new NetworkMonitor()
predictionEngine = new PredictionEngine(dataProfiler, networkMonitor)
summarizationEngine = new SummarizationEngine()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    logData = collectLogData()
    congestionRiskScore = predictionEngine.predictCongestionRisk(logData)

    if (congestionRiskScore > threshold) {
        summarizationProfile = selectSummarizationProfile(congestionRiskScore)
        summarizedLogData = summarizationEngine.summarize(logData, summarizationProfile)
        transmit(summarizedLogData)
    } else {
        transmit(logData)
    }

    // Periodic feedback to server on summarization effectiveness
    reportSummarizationStats()
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `CongestionRiskScore`: Integer (0-100)
*   `SummarizationProfile`: Object containing:
    *   Metric-specific configuration (e.g., histogram bin size, accuracy level)
    *   Data shaping rules (e.g., filter thresholds)
*   `LogData`: Array of metric-value pairs

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced network congestion
*   Improved telemetry performance
*   Reduced storage costs
*   Enhanced scalability
*   Adaptive to changing network conditions and application workloads
