**Dynamic Anticipatory Bundling & Pre-Shipment Customization**

**Concept:** Extend the ‘preview queue’ concept to proactively bundle items *before* the user explicitly adds them to a cart, based on predictive analytics, and allow pre-shipment customization of those bundled items.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Predictive Bundle Engine:**
    *   Data Inputs: User purchase history, browsing behavior, items currently in preview queue, trending items, seasonal data, social media activity (opt-in), demographic data.
    *   Algorithm: Employ a collaborative filtering and content-based filtering hybrid model. Weights assigned to each factor dynamically adjusted based on user engagement.
    *   Output: A ranked list of potential bundled items, along with a confidence score.

2.  **Dynamic Preview Queue Expansion:**
    *   Implementation: Expand the existing preview queue to include proactively predicted items, visually differentiated (e.g., dimmed opacity, subtle animation).
    *   User Interaction:
        *   Option to ‘Accept Bundle’: Adds predicted items to the primary preview queue (and locks in pricing).
        *   Option to ‘Reject Bundle’: Removes predicted items from the expanded preview queue.
        *   Option to ‘Customize Bundle’: Opens a customization interface (see #3).

3.  **Pre-Shipment Customization Interface:**
    *   Trigger: Activated when a user selects ‘Customize Bundle’ or interacts with a predicted item.
    *   Functionality:
        *   For configurable items (e.g., clothing, electronics): Allow selection of size, color, features, accessories, etc.
        *   For non-configurable items: Offer optional add-ons (e.g., extended warranty, protective case, cleaning supplies).
        *   Real-time price updates reflecting customization choices.
        *   3D/AR visualization of customized items (where applicable).

4.  **Pre-Shipment Processing & Packaging:**
    *   Integration with Warehouse Management System (WMS): Trigger automatic allocation of inventory for customized items.
    *   Automated Packaging Line Integration: Instruction set for automated assembly and packaging of customized bundles.
    *   Automated labeling, manifesting, and tracking.

5.  **User Interface (UI) Elements:**
    *   “Anticipated Bundles” section displayed prominently on item detail pages and within the preview queue.
    *   Visual cues indicating the level of confidence in each predicted item.
    *   Seamless integration with existing shopping cart and checkout processes.
    *   Personalized recommendations based on user preferences.

**Pseudocode (Bundle Prediction):**

FUNCTION predict_bundle(user_id)

    // Fetch user data
    user_history = GET_PURCHASE_HISTORY(user_id)

    FOR each item IN all_items:
        score = 0
        // Score based on purchase history
        score += similarity(item, user_history) * weight_history
        // Score based on browsing history
        score += similarity(item, user_browsing) * weight_browsing
        // Score based on trending items
        score += trending_score(item) * weight_trending
        // Score based on seasonal items
        score += seasonal_score(item) * weight_seasonal
        item.score = score

    // Sort items by score
    sorted_items = SORT(items, score, descending)

    // Return top N items as predicted bundle
    RETURN sorted_items[0:N]
