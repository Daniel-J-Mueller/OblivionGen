## Dynamic Stowage Location Scoring & Robotic Swarm Integration

**System Overview:**

This system expands upon the concept of proximity-based guidance and bin capacity by introducing a dynamic scoring system for stowage locations, integrated with a swarm of small, mobile robots (“Stow-Bots”) to optimize item placement *after* initial guidance.  The goal is to move beyond simply *indicating* eligible bins to actively *optimizing* storage density and accessibility based on real-time factors and predictive analysis.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Stow-Bots:**  Small, agile robots (approx. 12”x12”x6”) equipped with:
    *   Lifting mechanism (capable of handling a range of item sizes/weights - up to 10 lbs)
    *   High-resolution camera & depth sensor
    *   Wireless communication module (WiFi 6E/UWB)
    *   Onboard processing unit (edge AI capable)
    *   Rechargeable battery (docking stations throughout the facility)
*   **Enhanced Stowage Location Indicators:** RGB LED arrays embedded in/around each bin, capable of displaying complex information (score, status, alerts).  Capacitive touch sensors for user confirmation/override.
*   **Central Processing Unit (CPU):**  Handles overall system coordination, data analysis, and task assignment.
*   **Existing Infrastructure:**  Utilizes existing portable scanners and data store as outlined in the source patent.

**Software Components:**

*   **Dynamic Stowage Score Algorithm:**  Assigns a score to each stowage location based on:
    *   **Capacity:** Remaining usable volume/weight.
    *   **Accessibility:**  How easily the bin can be reached by humans/Stow-Bots (calculated based on aisle width, obstructions, and historical pick data).
    *   **Item Compatibility:**  Based on item properties, historical co-location data, and predictive modeling (e.g., items frequently picked together should be near each other).  Also factors in damage/fragility risks.
    *   **Stowage History:** A measure of how frequently the bin is accessed, and its average utilization level.
    *   **Predicted Demand:** Integration with demand forecasting systems to prioritize bins for frequently ordered items.
*   **Stow-Bot Task Management:**  Algorithm assigns tasks to Stow-Bots, optimizing routes and minimizing travel time.
*   **Real-time Mapping & Obstacle Avoidance:**  Utilizes sensor data from Stow-Bots and fixed cameras to create a dynamic map of the storage facility, and avoid obstacles.
*   **User Interface (UI):**  Provides a dashboard for monitoring system performance, configuring parameters, and managing tasks.
*   **Integration with WMS/Inventory Systems:**  Ensures data synchronization and accurate inventory tracking.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Item Scan & Initial Guidance:** Associate scans item using portable scanner. The system identifies eligible bins based on capacity, item properties, and proximity. The Enhanced Stowage Location Indicators illuminate, displaying a preliminary score for each bin.

2.  **Stow-Bot Evaluation:**  The system sends a request to the Stow-Bot Task Management system.  Available Stow-Bots assess the illuminated bins, considering factors such as:
    *   *Actual* bin capacity (accounting for irregular item shapes/stacking).
    *   *Optimal* item placement within the bin to maximize space utilization and stability.
    *   Potential for creating more accessible storage layouts.

3.  **Score Refinement & Stow-Bot Assignment:**  The Stow-Bot Task Management system refines the Stowage Location Score based on Stow-Bot assessments. The highest-scoring bin is assigned to a Stow-Bot.

4.  **Automated Item Relocation (Optional):** If the selected bin is not immediately accessible or requires item relocation, the Stow-Bot autonomously navigates to the location, safely relocates existing items (if necessary), and places the scanned item.

5.  **Inventory Update & Confirmation:** The system updates the inventory database to reflect the new item placement. The Stow-Bot sends a confirmation signal.

6.  **Continuous Optimization:** The system continuously monitors bin utilization, item pick rates, and Stow-Bot performance to refine the Stowage Location Score algorithm and optimize storage layouts.



**Pseudocode (Stow-Bot Task Assignment):**

```
FUNCTION AssignStowBotTask(itemID, eligibleBins):

    // Get Stow-Bot availability
    availableBots = GetAvailableStowBots()

    IF availableBots is empty:
        RETURN "No Stow-Bots available"

    // Calculate refined scores
    FOR bin IN eligibleBins:
        bin.refinedScore = CalculateRefinedScore(bin, itemID)

    // Sort bins by refined score (descending)
    sortedBins = SortBinsByScore(eligibleBins)

    // Assign task to the first available Stow-Bot
    selectedBot = availableBots[0]
    selectedBot.AssignTask(sortedBins[0], itemID)

    RETURN "Task assigned to Stow-Bot " + selectedBot.ID

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateRefinedScore(bin, itemID):
    score = bin.baseScore // From dynamic algorithm

    // Assess actual bin capacity with onboard sensor data
    actualCapacity = GetActualBinCapacity(bin)

    // Assess optimal placement for given item.
    itemPlacementScore = EvaluateItemPlacement(bin, itemID)

    score = score * actualCapacity * itemPlacementScore

    RETURN score
END FUNCTION
