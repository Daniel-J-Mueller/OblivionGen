## Adaptive Haptic Wake-Up System

**Core Concept:** Integrate a micro-haptic actuator array into the device housing. Instead of *only* responding to a duration-based wake-up signal, the system learns user touch patterns and uses subtle, localized vibrations to confirm wake-up intent, reducing false positives and creating a more intuitive user experience.

**Specifications:**

*   **Actuator Array:** 3x3 grid of miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) embedded within the device housing (e.g., rear cover, side bezel). Each actuator independently controlled. Resolution: 2mm spacing.
*   **Touch Sensor:** Capacitive touch sensor overlaying the actuator array.  Sensing area: 3cm x 3cm.
*   **Machine Learning Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on individual user touch data. The model learns the typical wake-up gesture for each user (e.g., specific finger placement, pressure, swipe pattern).
*   **Wake-Up Procedure:**
    1.  Device receives initial wake-up signal (power button press, external stimulus as per existing patent).
    2.  Actuator array activates, presenting a subtle, randomized vibration pattern.
    3.  User responds by touching the sensor area.
    4.  RNN analyzes touch data (position, pressure, velocity, area) in real-time.
    5.  If the touch data matches the user's learned wake-up gesture with >90% confidence, the device fully powers on.
    6.  If the confidence is below the threshold, the vibration pattern repeats (up to 3 times) to prompt the user to adjust their touch.
    7.  If the gesture is still not recognized after 3 attempts, the device remains in power-cut-off mode.
*   **Power Management:**
    *   Touch sensor and minimal RNN processing remain active in power-cut-off mode, consuming < 0.05 mA.
    *   Full RNN processing and device power-up activated only upon successful gesture recognition.
*   **Calibration:**
    *   Initial user calibration phase: User performs a series of wake-up gestures to train the RNN model.
    *   Continuous learning: RNN model continuously refines its understanding of the user's wake-up gesture over time.
*   **Failure Mitigation:**
    *   If the touch sensor fails, the system reverts to a duration-based wake-up method with a prolonged threshold (e.g., 5 seconds) to prevent accidental activation.
    *   Emergency override: A long-press of the power button bypasses the haptic wake-up system and immediately powers on the device.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize:
TrainRNN(user_data)  // during device setup

// Power Cut-Off Mode Loop:
While (device_in_power_cut_off_mode):
    ReceiveWakeUpSignal()
    ActivateHapticArray(random_pattern)
    WaitForTouch()

    TouchData = ReadTouchSensor()
    Confidence = RNN.Predict(TouchData)

    If (Confidence > 0.90):
        PowerOnDevice()
        Break // Exit Loop
    Else:
        RepeatHapticPattern() // Re-prompt User

If (TouchSensorFailed):
    UseDurationBasedWakeUp(5 seconds) // Fallback
```
