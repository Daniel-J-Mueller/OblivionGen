## Adaptive Write Prioritization via Learned Conflict Prediction

**Concept:** Leverage machine learning to predict write conflicts *before* they happen, and dynamically prioritize writes based on this prediction, reducing rollback frequency and improving throughput. This builds on the optimistic concurrency control described in the patent, but adds a proactive element.

**Specifications:**

**1. Conflict Prediction Model:**

*   **Input Features:**
    *   Transaction ID
    *   Pages being written
    *   Access patterns (read/write history of pages involved)
    *   Time of day (usage patterns)
    *   Transaction size (number of pages involved)
    *   Node ID initiating the transaction
*   **Model Type:** Gradient Boosted Decision Tree or Neural Network (experiment to determine best performance)
*   **Training Data:** Historical transaction logs, including successful commits, rollbacks due to conflict, and transaction metadata. Continuously retrain the model with new data.
*   **Output:**  A conflict probability score (0.0 - 1.0) for the transaction.

**2. Write Prioritization Engine:**

*   **Tiered Prioritization:**
    *   **High Priority:** Transactions with predicted conflict probability < 0.1. Execute immediately.
    *   **Medium Priority:** Transactions with 0.1 <= predicted conflict probability < 0.5.  Queue for execution, giving preference to shorter transactions.
    *   **Low Priority:** Transactions with predicted conflict probability >= 0.5. Queue for execution, potentially subject to throttling or even rejection during periods of high contention.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Adjust prioritization thresholds based on system load and observed conflict rates. If conflict rates are higher than expected, lower the thresholds.
*   **"Shadow" Transactions:** For low-priority transactions, consider executing a "shadow" transaction (read-only) to gather more information about potential conflicts before committing.  This is essentially a pre-check.

**3. Integration with Existing System:**

*   **Intercept Write Requests:** All write requests are intercepted before being sent to the storage service.
*   **Run Conflict Prediction:** The conflict prediction model is invoked to estimate the probability of conflict.
*   **Assign Priority:**  The write request is assigned a priority based on the predicted probability.
*   **Queue Management:** A priority queue manages the execution of write requests.
*   **Rollback Integration:**  If a rollback occurs, the event is logged and used to retrain the conflict prediction model.

**4.  Pseudocode (Write Request Processing):**

```pseudocode
function processWriteRequest(writeRequest):
  transactionId = writeRequest.transactionId
  pagesWritten = writeRequest.pagesWritten

  conflictProbability = predictConflict(transactionId, pagesWritten)

  if conflictProbability < 0.1:
    priority = "HIGH"
  else if conflictProbability < 0.5:
    priority = "MEDIUM"
  else:
    priority = "LOW"

  enqueueRequest(writeRequest, priority)

  return
```

**5.  Monitoring and Logging:**

*   **Conflict Prediction Accuracy:**  Monitor the accuracy of the conflict prediction model (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).
*   **Priority Queue Length:** Track the length of the priority queue for each priority level.
*   **Transaction Latency:** Measure the latency of transactions at each priority level.
*   **Rollback Rate:**  Monitor the rollback rate for each priority level.
*   **Resource Utilization:** Track CPU, memory, and I/O utilization.
