## Dynamic Trust Propagation via Decentralized Reputation Networks

**Concept:** Extend the source classification beyond simple 'fixed' or 'dynamic' to incorporate a decentralized reputation system. Instead of *just* classifying a source, assign a 'trust score' based on collective observations across a network. This trust score dynamically influences authentication requirements.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Reputation Network:** Implement a blockchain-inspired, permissioned ledger. Participating entities (ISPs, security providers, even end-users, optionally) contribute observations about source behavior (e.g., successful/failed authentications, flagged malicious activity). These observations are cryptographically signed.

2.  **Trust Score Calculation:** The trust score for a given source (IP address, device ID, etc.) is computed based on a weighted average of observations from the reputation network. Weighting factors can be assigned based on the reputation *of the observer* – a highly reputable entity carries more weight.

    *   `TrustScore(Source) = Σ [Weight(Observer) * Observation(Observer, Source)]`
    *   `Weight(Observer)` determined by a ‘reputation of reputation’ score (recursive, but capped to prevent infinite loops).
    *   Observations are time-decayed – recent activity is more influential.

3.  **Adaptive Authentication Thresholds:**  Define authentication levels (Weak, Medium, Strong) with associated Trust Score thresholds.

    *   Trust Score > 0.9: Weak Authentication
    *   0.5 < Trust Score <= 0.9: Medium Authentication
    *   Trust Score <= 0.5: Strong Authentication

4.  **Session-Aware Propagation:** During a session, observed behavior impacts the Trust Score *in real-time*. This allows for dynamic adjustments to authentication requirements. For example, a previously trusted source exhibiting suspicious behavior during a session will have its Trust Score lowered, triggering stronger authentication.

5.  **API Integration:** Provide an API for applications to query Trust Scores and receive recommended authentication levels.

    *   `GET /trust?source={source_address}` returns `{trust_score: 0.7, auth_level: "Medium"}`

6.  **Privacy Considerations:** Implement privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy or federated learning to protect the identity of observers and the details of observed behavior. 

**Pseudocode (Simplified Trust Score Update):**

```
function updateTrustScore(source, observer, observation):
  observerReputation = getObserverReputation(observer)
  observationWeight = observerReputation * timeDecayFactor

  currentTrustScore = getTrustScore(source)
  newTrustScore = currentTrustScore + (observationWeight * observation)
  newTrustScore = clamp(newTrustScore, 0, 1) // Ensure score stays within 0-1

  saveTrustScore(source, newTrustScore)
  return newTrustScore
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Distributed ledger technology (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda) or a custom implementation.
*   Cryptographic libraries for signing and verifying observations.
*   API server for providing Trust Score queries.
*   Scalable database for storing Trust Scores and observer reputations.
