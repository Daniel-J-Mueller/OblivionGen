## Dynamic Call Route "Health" & Predictive Shaping

**Concept:** Expand the call quality data beyond reactive decrementing of a "base value" to a proactive "health" score, incorporating predictive modeling to *shape* call routing *before* defects occur, and dynamically prioritize routes based on real-time network conditions and endpoint capabilities.

**Specs:**

*   **Health Score Calculation:**
    *   Each call route will have an associated "Health Score" initialized at a default value (e.g., 100).
    *   The Health Score is adjusted in real-time based on:
        *   **Call Defect Penalties:** As described in the patent (noise, static, dropped calls, crosstalk), with severity-based penalties.
        *   **Network Condition Integration:** Continuously monitor network metrics (latency, jitter, packet loss) along each route via passive or active probes. Apply dynamic penalties/bonuses to the Health Score based on these metrics.  Higher latency = penalty. Lower jitter = bonus.
        *   **Endpoint Capability Awareness:**  Determine the capabilities of the call endpoints (codec support, bandwidth availability, device type – mobile, landline, VoIP).  Apply bonuses if the route supports optimal endpoint capabilities, penalties if it doesn’t.  Example:  VoIP-to-VoIP route gets bonus for wideband codec support. Mobile-to-landline gets penalty.
        *   **Historical Trending:** Incorporate time-series analysis to identify patterns of degradation or improvement in Health Score.  Routes with consistently declining Health Scores trigger alerts for maintenance.
*   **Predictive Shaping Module:**
    *   A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network or long short-term memory network) trained on historical Health Score data, network metrics, and endpoint capabilities.
    *   The model predicts the *future* Health Score of each route over a short time horizon (e.g., 5-10 minutes).
    *   Based on these predictions, the system proactively adjusts routing weights.  Routes predicted to experience degradation have their weights reduced, while routes predicted to remain healthy have their weights increased.
*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**
    *   Routing weights are not static. They are dynamically adjusted based on:
        *   Current Health Score
        *   Predicted Health Score (from the Predictive Shaping Module)
        *   Call Cost (as in the patent)
        *   Real-time network congestion (detected via network probes)
        *   Endpoint capability matching.
    *   A weighted function calculates a "Routing Priority" score for each route. The call is routed via the route with the highest Routing Priority.
*   **Endpoint Profile Database:**
    *   Maintain a database of endpoint profiles, including:
        *   Phone number or identifier.
        *   Device type (mobile, landline, VoIP).
        *   Supported codecs.
        *   Bandwidth availability (estimated or measured).
        *   Preferred routing preferences (if available).
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   **Call Routing Engine:** The core component responsible for selecting and initiating calls.
    *   **Health Score Monitor:** Continuously monitors call quality, network conditions, and endpoint capabilities.
    *   **Predictive Shaping Module:** Trains and runs the machine learning model.
    *   **Endpoint Profile Database:** Stores and manages endpoint profiles.
    *   **Data Store:** Stores historical data, Health Scores, and routing weights.

**Pseudocode (Call Routing Engine):**

```
function routeCall(call, endpoint):
  routes = getAvailableRoutes(endpoint)
  routeScores = []

  for route in routes:
    healthScore = getHealthScore(route)
    predictedHealthScore = getPredictedHealthScore(route)
    cost = getCost(route)
    networkCongestion = getNetworkCongestion(route)
    endpointMatch = getEndpointMatchScore(endpoint, route) //Score how well this endpoint matches the route

    routingPriority = (healthScore * 0.4) + (predictedHealthScore * 0.3) + (1/cost * 0.1) + (1/networkCongestion * 0.1) + (endpointMatch * 0.1)

    routeScores.append((route, routingPriority))

  bestRoute = max(routeScores, key=lambda item: item[1])

  initiateCall(call, bestRoute[0])
```
