**Battery Pack Acoustic Resonance Mapping & Predictive Failure Analysis**

**System Specs:**

*   **Components:**
    *   Array of miniature, high-frequency piezoelectric transducers integrated into the battery pack enclosure – positioned to cover the entire battery cell array. Resolution: 1 transducer per 5 cells minimum.
    *   High-bandwidth data acquisition system (DAQ) capable of capturing acoustic signals simultaneously from all transducers. Sample rate: 500 kHz minimum.
    *   Dedicated processing unit (FPGA or similar) for real-time signal processing.
    *   Machine learning (ML) model trained on acoustic signatures of healthy and failing battery cells.
    *   Thermal monitoring system (as in the provided patent) for correlation.
*   **Operational Procedure:**
    1.  **Baseline Mapping:** During initial battery pack assembly and periodic checks, system generates a ‘sonic fingerprint’ of each cell by emitting a controlled, short-duration excitation signal (e.g., chirp) and recording the resulting acoustic response via transducers. This creates a database of 'healthy' acoustic signatures.
    2.  **Continuous Monitoring:** During operation, the system continuously listens for acoustic anomalies.
    3.  **Feature Extraction:** Raw acoustic data is processed to extract relevant features:
        *   Resonance frequencies (identify natural vibration modes of cells)
        *   Amplitude decay rates (indicate material degradation)
        *   Harmonic distortion (reveal internal stress)
        *   Transient acoustic events (detect early crack formation)
    4.  **Anomaly Detection:** Extracted features are compared to the baseline signatures and the ML model. Deviations beyond a threshold trigger alerts.
    5.  **Localization:** Using triangulation or beamforming techniques, the system pinpoints the location of the anomalous cell.
    6.  **Predictive Analysis:** Time series analysis of acoustic features predicts potential cell failure before thermal runaway occurs.
    7.  **Data Logging & Reporting:** All acoustic data and analysis results are logged for future study and system improvement.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
define transducer_array[N] // Array of transducers
define baseline_signatures[N] // Healthy cell acoustic signatures
define ML_model // Trained machine learning model

// Baseline Mapping
function map_baseline() {
    for each cell in battery_pack {
        transmit excitation_signal
        record acoustic_response
        baseline_signatures[cell] = acoustic_response
    }
}

// Continuous Monitoring
while(battery_pack_active) {
    for each transducer in transducer_array {
        record acoustic_data
        extract features(acoustic_data)
        compare to baseline_signatures and ML_model
        if anomaly_detected {
            localize_anomaly(transducer_data)
            output alert(anomaly_location, severity)
            predict_failure(time_series_data)
        }
    }
}
```

**Novelty:** This system focuses on *acoustic* monitoring *before* thermal effects become significant.  Existing systems are primarily reactive (detecting heat). By analyzing the mechanical state of cells via acoustic resonance, it aims to predict failure and prevent thermal runaway altogether. It combines passive listening with controlled excitation for more robust anomaly detection. The integration of time-series analysis for predictive failure modeling is a key differentiator.
