## Dynamic Contact Inference & Proactive Communication Scheduling

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply routing replies to a dynamically inferred contact. Utilize the inferred contact & associated text data to *proactively* schedule communication, anticipating user needs based on context.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** "Anticipatory Scheduler" – operates as a background process, triggered by successful contact inference (as defined in the source patent).
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Inferred Second Contact Identifier (from patent).
    *   Full message text data (original & potentially TTS output).
    *   User calendar access (permission-based).
    *   Location data (optional, permission-based).
    *   Natural Language Understanding (NLU) output from message analysis – key entities (time, location, activity, sentiment).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Context Extraction:** NLU processes message text to identify potential activities, time references, locations, and sentiment.
    2.  **Calendar/Schedule Scan:**  Access user calendar (with permission) to identify existing appointments or scheduled events near the extracted time/location.
    3.  **Proactive Event Suggestion:** If a relevant calendar event is found *or* a clear activity is inferred (e.g., "Let's meet for lunch"), the system suggests creating a calendar event.
    4.  **Communication Mode Recommendation:** Based on message content, suggest optimal communication mode for the scheduled event. Options:
        *   Voice Call (urgent, requires immediate response).
        *   Video Call (requires visual interaction).
        *   Text Message (quick update, non-urgent).
        *   Automated Reminder (for existing appointments).
    5.  **Draft Message Generation:** Generate a draft message confirming the scheduled event, tailored to the chosen communication mode.  Example: "Confirmed lunch with [inferred contact] at [location] on [date/time]. See you there!"
    6.  **User Confirmation:** Present the suggested event & draft message to the user for approval. User can edit, cancel, or approve.
    7.  **Event Creation & Communication:** If approved, create the calendar event and send the draft message.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION ProcessInferredContact(inferredContact, messageText)
    context = AnalyzeMessage(messageText) // NLU processing
    calendarEvents = GetCalendarEvents(context.time, context.location)
    IF calendarEvents.isEmpty() AND context.activity IS NOT NULL THEN
        suggestEvent = CreateEventSuggestion(context.activity, context.time, context.location, inferredContact)
        userConfirmation = PromptUser(suggestEvent)
        IF userConfirmation == TRUE THEN
            CreateCalendarEvent(suggestEvent)
            draftMessage = GenerateDraftMessage(suggestEvent)
            SendMessage(draftMessage, inferredContact)
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

*   **Hardware/Software Requirements:**
    *   Integration with existing messaging platform.
    *   Access to user calendar API (Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, etc.).
    *   NLU engine (pre-trained or custom model).
    *   Secure storage of user permissions & data.
*   **Novelty:** This expands beyond simply *routing* communication to *anticipating* communication needs and proactively scheduling events. It’s a shift from reactive messaging to a more intelligent, assistant-like experience.
