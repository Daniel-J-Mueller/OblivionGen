## Dynamic Resource 'Shadowing' & Predictive Policy Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend the metric-based access control by proactively creating 'shadow' resources mirroring live ones. These shadows undergo simulated stress/attack scenarios *before* real-world requests hit the live resource, allowing for predictive policy adjustments *and* an early warning system.

**Specifications:**

*   **Shadow Resource Creation:** A service scans defined resources and, based on criticality/sensitivity, automatically provisions identical 'shadow' instances in a sandboxed environment.  Shadows replicate data periodically, but *do not* serve live traffic.
*   **Simulated Attack Engine:** A dedicated engine generates varied attack vectors (DoS, SQLi, XSS, etc.) and applies them *exclusively* to the shadow resources. This engine uses configurable profiles mirroring real-world threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Metric Correlation & Anomaly Propagation:**  Metrics gathered from the shadow resource attacks (CPU load, network latency, error rates, specific exploit attempts) are correlated.  Crucially, *anomalies detected in the shadows trigger a 'risk score' increase for the corresponding live resource*.
*   **Predictive Policy Adjustment:**  The system monitors the risk score. If the score exceeds a configurable threshold, the policy enforcement service *automatically adjusts* the dynamic metric condition. This could involve lowering the anomalous activity threshold, triggering multi-factor authentication, or even temporarily blocking traffic.
*   **Feedback Loop & Policy Optimization:** The system records the effectiveness of each policy adjustment.  A machine learning model analyzes this data to *optimize* the thresholds and adjustment strategies over time.
*   **‘Time-to-Impact’ Prediction:** Based on the attack simulations and observed behavior in the shadows, the system estimates the ‘time-to-impact’ -  how long before a similar attack would successfully compromise the live resource.  This information is surfaced to security administrators.

**Pseudocode (Policy Adjustment Logic):**

```
FUNCTION adjustPolicy(resourceID, riskScore, currentPolicy):
  IF riskScore > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
    newPolicy = currentPolicy
    newPolicy.anomalousActivityThreshold = currentPolicy.anomalousActivityThreshold * 0.8 // Lower threshold
    newPolicy.requireMFA = TRUE
    RETURN newPolicy
  ELSE IF riskScore > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
    newPolicy = currentPolicy
    newPolicy.anomalousActivityThreshold = currentPolicy.anomalousActivityThreshold * 0.95 // Slight reduction
    RETURN newPolicy
  ELSE:
    RETURN currentPolicy
```

**Data Stores:**

*   Shadow Resource Definitions (metadata about mirrored resources)
*   Attack Simulation Profiles (configurations for the attack engine)
*   Risk Score History (time-series data for each resource)
*   Policy Adjustment Logs (record of all policy changes)
