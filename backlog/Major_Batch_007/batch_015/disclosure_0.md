## Dynamic Precision Weighting for Systolic Arrays

**Concept:** Adaptively adjust the numerical precision of weight values within the systolic array based on observed activation levels. This minimizes computational overhead and power consumption without sacrificing accuracy, particularly during inference with quantized neural networks.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Each Processing Element (PE) incorporates a dynamic precision control unit (DPCU).
    *   DPCU comprises a small lookup table (LUT) storing precision levels (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit floating point) mapped to activation ranges.
    *   PE includes configurable multipliers and adders capable of operating at different precision levels.
    *   Global activation monitor circuit samples activation levels from PE outputs across the array.
    *   Configuration bus linking Global Activation Monitor, LUTs, and precision control within each PE.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   Calibration Phase: During initial training or calibration, the system profiles activation distributions for each layer and weight.
    *   LUT Population: Activation profiles are used to populate LUTs in each PE. LUTs map observed activation ranges to optimal weight precision levels.
    *   Runtime Adjustment:
        1.  Global Activation Monitor samples PE outputs.
        2.  Monitor calculates activation statistics (mean, variance).
        3.  Activation statistics are used as input to LUTs within each PE.
        4.  LUT outputs specify the weight precision for the current computation.
        5.  DPCU configures multipliers and adders accordingly.
*   **Pseudocode (PE Operation):**

```
function compute(x_in1, x_in2, y_in1, y_in2):
  //Read weight value from local memory
  weight = read_weight()

  //Read activation statistics from Global Monitor
  activation_stats = read_activation_stats()

  //Lookup precision level from LUT based on activation_stats
  precision_level = LUT.lookup(activation_stats)

  //Configure multiplier/adder precision
  multiplier.set_precision(precision_level)
  adder.set_precision(precision_level)

  //Perform multiplication
  mult_result1 = multiplier.multiply(x_in1, weight)
  mult_result2 = multiplier.multiply(x_in2, weight)

  //Perform addition
  y_out1 = adder.add(mult_result1, y_in1)
  y_out2 = adder.add(mult_result2, y_in2)

  return y_out1, y_out2
```

*   **Output Buffering:** Standard output buffering practices are employed to collect the Y-out values for subsequent layers or analysis.
*   **Potential Extensions:** Explore the use of reinforcement learning to dynamically adapt LUT entries based on real-time performance metrics (accuracy, power consumption). Consider integrating sparsity awareness into the precision control unit, further reducing computational cost.
