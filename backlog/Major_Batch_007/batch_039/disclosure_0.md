## Acoustic Camouflage - Adaptive Sound Projection

**Concept:** A wireless speaker system that doesn't just *play* sound, but actively manipulates the acoustic environment to *create* the illusion of sound originating from a different location, or to mask existing sounds. Think of it as acoustic camouflage.

**Specs:**

*   **Speaker Array:** Minimum 32 individually controllable micro-speakers arranged in a geodesic dome configuration (approx. 18‚Äù diameter). Each speaker must be capable of phase and amplitude control with <1ms latency.
*   **Microphone Array:** 64 MEMS microphones embedded within the geodesic dome structure, evenly distributed across the surface. Purpose: Spatial audio capture and environmental noise analysis.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance embedded system (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano) capable of real-time beamforming, sound source localization, and signal processing. Minimum 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD.
*   **AI Core:** Dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) for running machine learning models related to acoustic scene understanding and sound source separation.
*   **Software Stack:**
    *   **Acoustic Mapping Module:** Creates a 3D map of the surrounding environment using microphone array data. Identifies surfaces, objects, and potential sound reflection points.
    *   **Sound Source Localization:** Accurately determines the location of sound sources in the environment.
    *   **Beamforming Engine:** Dynamically adjusts the phase and amplitude of each micro-speaker to create focused sound beams.
    *   **Sound Masking Algorithms:**  Generates and projects opposing sound waves to actively cancel out unwanted noise.
    *   **Virtual Sound Source Projection:** Projects the perceived location of a sound source to a different point in space. Uses head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to create a realistic 3D audio experience.
    *   **Adaptive Algorithm:** Algorithm which dynamically adjust beamforming to account for ambient noise and environmental changes.
*   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, USB-C for power and data.
*   **Power:** 48V DC power supply.
*   **Materials:** Geodesic dome structure constructed from lightweight, acoustically transparent material (e.g., perforated aluminum or acrylic).
*   **Control Interface:** Mobile app (iOS and Android) for controlling sound projection, masking, and virtual sound source location.

**Pseudocode - Virtual Sound Source Projection**

```
// Input: Desired virtual sound source location (x_v, y_v, z_v)
//        Current listener location (x_l, y_l, z_l)
//        Current sound source signal (audio_data)

// 1. Calculate the vector from the sound source to the listener:
vector_sl = (x_l - x_s, y_l - y_s, z_l - z_s);

// 2. Calculate the vector from the desired virtual source to the listener:
vector_vl = (x_l - x_v, y_l - y_v, z_l - z_v);

// 3. Calculate the head-related transfer function (HRTF) for the virtual source location.
//    (This requires a pre-computed HRTF database or a real-time HRTF generation algorithm.)
hrtf = get_hrtf(x_v, y_v, z_v);

// 4. Convolve the audio signal with the HRTF to create the perceived sound.
perceived_sound = convolve(audio_data, hrtf);

// 5. Apply beamforming to project the perceived sound towards the listener.
//    (This requires calculating the delay and amplitude for each micro-speaker.)
beamformed_signal = beamform(perceived_sound, x_l, y_l, z_l);

// 6. Output the beamformed signal to the micro-speaker array.
output(beamformed_signal);
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Immersive Gaming/VR:** Creates realistic and dynamic soundscapes.
*   **Home Theater:** Projects sound to create the illusion of a larger soundstage.
*   **Noise Cancellation:** Actively cancels out unwanted noise in specific areas.
*   **Acoustic Privacy:** Creates a "bubble" of silence around a user.
*   **Spatial Audio Communication:** Enables more natural and immersive teleconferencing.
*   **Public Spaces:** Directs sound in public areas for targeted announcements or music playback.
