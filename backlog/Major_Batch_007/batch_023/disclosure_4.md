## Dynamic Transcription Style Switching

**Concept:** Extend the performance indication system to *actively* modify the transcription style (font, size, color, etc.) based on detected audio characteristics, going beyond simple indicators. This creates a dynamic, visually-rich transcription experience that prioritizes readability and comprehension in real-time.

**Specs:**

*   **Audio Analysis Module:** Continuously analyze incoming audio stream for:
    *   **Speaker Count:** Detect number of simultaneous speakers.
    *   **Emotional Tone:** Analyze audio for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, angry, excited, etc.).
    *   **Acoustic Environment:** Categorize environment (office, outdoor, quiet, noisy).
    *   **Speaking Rate:** Measure words per minute.
*   **Transcription Style Profiles:** Predefined style profiles linked to audio analysis outputs:
    *   **Multi-Speaker Profile:**  Different colors assigned to each detected speaker.  Emphasis on speaker identification.
    *   **High-Emotion Profile:** Bold font, increased font size, potentially highlighting keywords associated with the detected emotion.
    *   **Noisy Environment Profile:**  Increased font weight, contrasting colors, larger font size for improved readability.
    *   **Fast Speech Profile:**  Slightly increased inter-word spacing, potentially shortening contractions to aid comprehension.
    *   **Default Profile:** Standard transcription style.
*   **Style Switching Logic:**
    *   If speaker count > 1: Apply Multi-Speaker Profile.
    *   If emotional tone indicates high emotion: Apply High-Emotion Profile.
    *   If acoustic environment indicates noise: Apply Noisy Environment Profile.
    *   If speaking rate exceeds threshold: Apply Fast Speech Profile.
    *   If multiple conditions are met, prioritize based on a configurable weighting system.
    *   If no conditions are met, apply Default Profile.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to:
    *   Adjust the sensitivity of audio analysis triggers.
    *   Define custom style profiles.
    *   Override automatic style switching.
*   **Implementation Notes:**
    *   The system can be implemented as a software module integrated into existing transcription applications.
    *   Consider using machine learning models to improve the accuracy of audio analysis.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize Audio Analysis Module
audioAnalyzer = new AudioAnalysisModule()

// Initialize Style Manager
styleManager = new StyleManager()

// Main Loop
while (audioStream.hasData()) {
  audioData = audioStream.getData()
  analysisResults = audioAnalyzer.analyze(audioData)

  // Determine appropriate style profile
  if (analysisResults.speakerCount > 1) {
    styleProfile = "MultiSpeaker"
  } else if (analysisResults.emotion == "High") {
    styleProfile = "HighEmotion"
  } else if (analysisResults.noiseLevel == "High") {
    styleProfile = "NoisyEnvironment"
  } else if (analysisResults.speakingRate > threshold) {
    styleProfile = "FastSpeech"
  } else {
    styleProfile = "Default"
  }

  // Apply style to transcription
  transcription = transcriptionEngine.transcribe(audioData)
  styledTranscription = styleManager.applyStyle(transcription, styleProfile)

  // Display styled transcription
  display.show(styledTranscription)
}
```
