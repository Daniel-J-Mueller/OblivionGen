## Dynamic Research Note ‘Ecosystem’ with Proactive Synthesis

**Concept:** Expand the research note functionality beyond simple comparison to create a dynamic, interconnected ‘ecosystem’ of user-generated knowledge, proactively synthesizing insights *across* multiple notes and user contributions.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Structures:**

*   **Research Note Core:** Existing structure (item comparisons, user input).
*   **Insight Fragments:** Small, discrete units of information extracted from research notes (e.g., "Battery life is a major concern for this model," "The camera performs well in low light").  These are tagged with:
    *   Item(s) referenced
    *   Aspect/Attribute (e.g., Battery Life, Camera Quality, Price)
    *   Sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
    *   User ID (author)
    *   Confidence Score (algorithmically determined, based on agreement with other fragments)
*   **Knowledge Graph:** A graph database linking Insight Fragments, Items, Attributes, and Users. Edges represent relationships (e.g., "Item X *has attribute* Battery Life," "User Y *expressed sentiment* Negative towards Item X's Battery Life").

**II. System Components:**

*   **Insight Extraction Engine:**  Natural Language Processing (NLP) module that automatically extracts Insight Fragments from newly created/edited research notes.
*   **Knowledge Graph Builder:** Module responsible for creating and updating the Knowledge Graph based on extracted Insight Fragments.
*   **Proactive Synthesis Engine:** Core innovation. This engine monitors user browsing behavior (similar to existing claim 1) *and* the Knowledge Graph. When a user views an item:
    1.  Identify relevant Insight Fragments (based on item, attributes, and user profile/history).
    2.  Synthesize insights:  Combine information from multiple fragments to generate *new* statements (e.g., "While User A found the camera excellent, several users report poor battery life, suggesting a trade-off.").
    3.  Present synthesized insights to the user in a dedicated panel alongside the catalog page.
*   **Reputation/Trust System:**  Assigns a reputation score to each user based on the ‘helpfulness’ of their contributed Insight Fragments (determined by other users' ratings/engagement).  Insight Fragments from high-reputation users are given greater weight in the Synthesis Engine.
*   **Collaborative Insight Editing:** Allow users to collaboratively refine and correct Insight Fragments, improving data quality.

**III. Pseudocode (Proactive Synthesis Engine):**

```
function synthesizeInsights(user, item):
  relevantFragments = KnowledgeGraph.query(item=item, maxDepth=3)  //Find fragments related to the item and its attributes
  filteredFragments = filterFragments(relevantFragments, user) //Filter based on user preferences & trust scores
  insights = synthesize(filteredFragments) //Combine & generate new statements.  Uses rule-based or ML model
  return insights

function filterFragments(fragments, user):
  trustedFragments = []
  for fragment in fragments:
    authorReputation = getUserReputation(fragment.author)
    if authorReputation > threshold:
      trustedFragments.append(fragment)
  return trustedFragments

function synthesize(fragments):
  //Rule-based or ML model to combine fragments
  //Example:
  if ("battery life" in fragment1 and "negative" in fragment1) and ("battery life" in fragment2 and "negative" in fragment2):
    return "Multiple users report poor battery life with this item."
  else:
    return "Mixed opinions on battery life."
```

**IV. User Interface Considerations:**

*   Dedicated “Insights Panel” on catalog pages.
*   Visual cues indicating the source and trustworthiness of each insight.
*   Option to drill down into the underlying research notes.
*   Mechanisms for users to rate/flag insights as helpful/misleading.
