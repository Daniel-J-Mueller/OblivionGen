## Adaptive Execution Event Weighting Based on System State

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the weighting of execution events fed into the machine learning model based on the current system state – not just time of day, but also resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O), network activity, and even external factors like user activity or detected threats. This goes beyond simply monitoring *what* is happening, and begins to account for *why* it’s happening.

**Specifications:**

1.  **System State Collection Module:**
    *   Collects real-time data on:
        *   CPU utilization (per core).
        *   Memory usage (total and per process).
        *   Disk I/O (read/write rates, latency).
        *   Network traffic (bandwidth, latency, packet loss).
        *   Active user count/activity levels.
        *   Security alerts/threat detections.
    *   Data is normalized and aggregated into a "System State Vector" (SSV).

2.  **Weighting Function Module:**
    *   Accepts the SSV as input.
    *   Employs a learned function (e.g., another neural network, a decision tree, or a rule-based system) to map the SSV to a set of weights for each monitored execution event.
    *   The learned function is trained alongside the anomaly detection model, allowing it to adapt to correlations between system state and event importance.
    *   Output: A weight vector where each element corresponds to the weight of a specific execution event.

3.  **Weighted Input Layer:**
    *   The existing input layer of the anomaly detection model is modified to incorporate the weight vector.
    *   Each input value (representing the occurrence of an execution event) is multiplied by its corresponding weight *before* being fed into the model.

4.  **Dynamic Retraining & Adaptation:**
    *   The weighting function and anomaly detection model are retrained periodically (or triggered by significant system state changes).
    *   Retraining uses historical data including system state, execution events, and anomaly detections.
    *   Implementation can use online learning techniques to adapt continuously without full retraining.

**Pseudocode (Weighting Function):**

```
function calculate_event_weights(system_state_vector):
  // system_state_vector: [cpu_util, mem_util, disk_io, network_traffic, user_activity, threat_level]

  // Example: Simple linear combination with learned coefficients
  coefficients = [0.1, -0.05, 0.2, 0.01, -0.15, 0.3] // Learned from training

  weighted_sum = coefficients[0] * system_state_vector[0] + \
                 coefficients[1] * system_state_vector[1] + \
                 coefficients[2] * system_state_vector[2] + \
                 coefficients[3] * system_state_vector[3] + \
                 coefficients[4] * system_state_vector[4] + \
                 coefficients[5] * system_state_vector[5]

  // Apply a sigmoid function to normalize the weighted sum (optional)
  normalized_weight = 1 / (1 + exp(-weighted_sum))

  // Adjust weights for individual events based on normalized_weight
  event_weights = [base_weight * normalized_weight for base_weight in base_event_weights]

  return event_weights
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Anomaly Detection Accuracy:** By focusing on events that are more relevant to the current system state, the model can better identify true anomalies.
*   **Reduced False Positives:**  Ignoring or downweighting less important events minimizes noise and reduces false alarms.
*   **Enhanced Adaptability:** The dynamic weighting function allows the model to adapt to changing system conditions and usage patterns.
*   **Proactive Threat Detection:** Weighting security alerts higher during periods of increased network activity or suspicious behavior can facilitate faster threat detection.
