## Dynamic Policy Weaving for Multi-Tenant Resource Access

**Concept:** Extend the existing authentication/authorization framework to dynamically *weave* policies from multiple sources – not just the provider and customer – into a composite policy set used for request evaluation. This enables granular, context-aware access control beyond simple customer-defined rules.

**Specifications:**

**1. Policy Sources:**

*   **Provider Policies:** Core security and infrastructure limitations (e.g., rate limiting, geographic restrictions). These are immutable and form the base layer.
*   **Customer Policies:** Business logic and access rules specific to the customer’s service. These are configurable by the customer.
*   **Caller Policies:**  Policies defined *by* the requesting application/user, submitted as part of the request. These act as constraints or ‘bids’ for resources, potentially including price sensitivity or preferred performance characteristics.
*   **Environmental Policies:** Real-time conditions influencing access (e.g., system load, time of day, detected security threats).  Data is ingested from monitoring systems.

**2. Policy Format:**

*   Utilize a standardized policy language (e.g., Rego, Open Policy Agent) for interoperability.
*   Policies are structured as sets of rules with conditions and actions.
*   Each policy source is tagged to identify its origin.

**3. Policy Weaver Component:**

*   A dedicated service responsible for compiling the composite policy set.
*   Input: Request details, all available policy sources.
*   Process:
    1.  Fetch Provider Policies (immutable).
    2.  Fetch Customer Policies (configurable).
    3.  Extract Caller Policies from the request (if present).
    4.  Ingest Environmental Policies from monitoring systems.
    5.  Resolve conflicts between policies using a defined priority scheme (Provider > Customer > Caller > Environmental).  Caller policies operate as constraints – they *reduce* access, not grant it.
    6.  Compile the unified policy set.
*   Output: A single, executable policy set used for request evaluation.

**4. Request Evaluation Flow:**

1.  Request arrives at the first endpoint.
2.  Policy Weaver is invoked to compile the policy set.
3.  The request is evaluated against the compiled policy set.
4.  Access is granted or denied based on the evaluation.
5.  An audit log entry is created, including the policy sources used and the evaluation result.

**Pseudocode (Policy Weaver):**

```
function weavePolicies(request, providerPolicies, customerPolicies, callerPolicies, environmentalPolicies):
  unifiedPolicies = []

  // Add Provider Policies (highest priority)
  unifiedPolicies.extend(providerPolicies)

  // Add Customer Policies
  unifiedPolicies.extend(customerPolicies)

  // Add Caller Policies (as constraints)
  if callerPolicies != null:
    for policy in callerPolicies:
      unifiedPolicies.append(policy) // Caller policies reduce access

  // Add Environmental Policies
  unifiedPolicies.extend(environmentalPolicies)

  // Conflict Resolution (Prioritize Provider > Customer > Caller > Environmental)
  // (Implementation details omitted for brevity)

  return unifiedPolicies
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond static, predefined policies to a dynamic, context-aware access control framework. It allows customers to delegate fine-grained access control to their users, while retaining ultimate control over their resources.  It introduces the concept of ‘bid-based’ access, where applications can express their resource needs and constraints, potentially leading to optimized resource allocation and pricing. This isn't just about security; it's about building a more flexible and efficient multi-tenant platform.
