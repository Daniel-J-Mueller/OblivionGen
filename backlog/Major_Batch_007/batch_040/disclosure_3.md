## Dynamic Resonance Charging & Data Transfer System

**Concept:** Expand beyond static conductive contact charging to utilize resonant inductive coupling *through* the charging mat, dynamically adjusting frequency to maximize efficiency and simultaneously transfer data. This bypasses potential wear and tear on physical connectors and allows for charging *through* non-conductive materials.

**Specifications:**

**1. Charging Mat Core:**

*   **Material:** Layered composite – Top layer: Durable, non-conductive polymer (e.g., Polyetheretherketone - PEEK) for wear resistance. Middle layer: High permeability ferrite core shaped to focus magnetic field. Bottom layer: Copper coil array configured for multi-frequency operation.
*   **Coil Configuration:** Array of individually addressable coils, each tuned to a slightly different frequency. Enables dynamic beamforming – concentrating the magnetic field on the UAV’s receiver.
*   **Dimensions:** Variable, scaleable to accommodate different UAV sizes. Standard initial dimensions: 60cm x 60cm x 5cm.
*   **Power Supply:** Integrated high-frequency power amplifier with digital control. Input: Standard AC power. Output: Variable frequency, variable power (10W – 500W).
*   **Communication Module:** Integrated Bluetooth 5.2 module for initial connection/authentication. Wi-Fi 6E module for high-bandwidth data transfer.

**2. UAV Receiver Unit:**

*   **Material:** Lightweight aluminum housing.
*   **Coil Configuration:** Multi-turn receiving coil tuned to a range of frequencies matching the charging mat. Shielded to minimize interference.
*   **Resonance Tracking:** Microcontroller with real-time frequency analysis capability. Continuously scans for the strongest resonant frequency emitted by the charging mat.
*   **Data Communication:** Integrated Wi-Fi 6E transceiver. Supports secure data transfer.
*   **Power Regulation:** DC-DC converter to regulate incoming power to the UAV battery.
*   **Dimensions:**  10cm x 5cm x 2cm.  Mountable to underside of UAV.

**3. Control System (Software/Firmware):**

*   **Dynamic Frequency Adjustment:** Algorithm that continuously optimizes the charging frequency based on UAV position, load, and environmental factors. Utilizes a feedback loop from the UAV receiver.
*   **Beamforming:**  Controls individual coil activation in the charging mat to steer the magnetic field towards the UAV receiver.  Minimizes energy loss.
*   **Data Prioritization:**  Prioritizes data transfer based on urgency.  Critical flight data takes precedence.
*   **Security:** Encryption and authentication protocols to prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Protocol:** Custom UDP protocol for low latency data transfer.

**4. System Operation:**

1.  UAV approaches the charging mat.
2.  Initial connection established via Bluetooth.
3.  UAV receiver scans for the strongest resonant frequency from the charging mat.
4.  Charging mat and UAV synchronize frequencies.
5.  Charging begins via resonant inductive coupling.
6.  Data transfer occurs simultaneously via Wi-Fi 6E.
7.  Charging mat dynamically adjusts frequency and beamforming to maintain optimal charging efficiency.
8.  UAV initiates departure sequence.
9.  Charging and data transfer terminate.



**Pseudocode (Frequency Optimization Loop - Charging Mat):**

```
while (UAV_Present) {
    frequency = GetOptimalFrequency(UAV_Position, Load);
    SetCoilFrequency(frequency);

    //Beamforming - activate coils closest to UAV
    ActivateCoils(UAV_Position);

    PowerOutput = CalculatePowerOutput(UAV_BatteryLevel, Frequency);
    SetPowerOutput(PowerOutput);

    //Collect feedback from UAV (signal strength, battery level)
    feedback = GetUAVFeedback();

    //Adjust frequency and power based on feedback
    frequency = AdjustFrequency(frequency, feedback);
    power = AdjustPower(power, feedback);
}
```

This system moves beyond simple contact charging, offering a more robust, efficient, and versatile solution for UAV power and data management.  The use of resonant inductive coupling allows for greater flexibility and reliability, while the dynamic frequency adjustment ensures optimal performance under varying conditions.
