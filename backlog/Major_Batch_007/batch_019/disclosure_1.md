## Dynamic Macroblock Splitting via Reinforcement Learning

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent integrated into the video encoding pipeline, operating *before* mode selection as described in the provided patent.
*   **Input:** Raw video frame data, extracted features for each macroblock (as per the existing system), and a performance metric feedback loop (see ‘Performance Metrics & Reward Function’ below).
*   **Output:** A macroblock splitting instruction set – for each macroblock, either retain its current size, split it into four equal sub-macroblocks, or apply an asymmetric split (e.g., horizontal or vertical division into unequal parts).
*   **RL Agent:** A Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent, trained to maximize encoding efficiency and visual quality.
*   **State Space:** The state observed by the RL agent for each macroblock will include:
    *   Extracted features (motion vectors, texture complexity, etc.).
    *   Size of the macroblock.
    *   Encoding mode suggested by the existing ML hierarchy.
    *   Contextual features: average encoding cost of neighboring macroblocks.
*   **Action Space:** Discrete actions representing different splitting options:
    *   0: No split (retain current size).
    *   1: Split into four equal sub-macroblocks.
    *   2: Split horizontally (into two unequal parts – ratio determined by a learned parameter).
    *   3: Split vertically (into two unequal parts – ratio determined by a learned parameter).
*   **Performance Metrics & Reward Function:**
    *   **Primary:** Rate-Distortion optimization. Reward = - (Distortion + λ * Rate) where λ is a weighting factor. Distortion is measured using a perceptual metric (e.g., MS-SSIM). Rate is the number of bits required to encode the macroblock (or its sub-macroblocks).
    *   **Secondary:**  Reward shaping to encourage splitting in areas of high motion or complexity, and penalize unnecessary splitting.
*   **Training Data:** Large dataset of diverse video content. Can leverage existing video datasets or generate synthetic data.
*   **Integration:** The RL agent operates in parallel with the existing ML-based encoding mode selection system. The RL agent proposes macroblock splitting options, which are then fed into the existing ML hierarchy for mode selection.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Utilize GPU acceleration for both RL agent inference and encoding.

**Pseudocode:**

```
For each frame in video:
    For each macroblock in frame:
        Extract features (motion, texture, etc.)
        Observe state (features, size, existing ML suggestion, neighbor context)
        RL Agent predicts action (0: no split, 1: 4-way, 2: horizontal, 3: vertical)

        If action == 1:
            Split macroblock into four equal sub-macroblocks
        If action == 2:
            Split macroblock horizontally (unequal ratio determined by learned parameter)
        If action == 3:
            Split macroblock vertically (unequal ratio determined by learned parameter)

        Determine encoding mode for (potentially split) macroblock(s) using existing ML hierarchy

        Encode macroblock(s)

        Calculate Rate-Distortion cost

        Update RL agent’s Q-network based on reward (negative cost)
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond static macroblock sizes and introduces *dynamic* splitting guided by reinforcement learning. By learning to adapt the macroblock structure to the content, we aim to improve encoding efficiency and visual quality compared to fixed-size macroblock encoding. The integration with the existing ML hierarchy allows the RL agent to focus on the *structure* of the macroblocks, while the ML hierarchy handles the more complex task of mode selection *within* those structures. This division of labor could lead to a more robust and efficient encoding pipeline.
