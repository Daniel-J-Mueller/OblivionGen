## Autonomous Network Reputation System

**Concept:** Extend the IP address validation system to create a dynamic, autonomous reputation system for network segments (prefixes) based on observed behavior and correlation with known threat intelligence. Instead of *just* verifying if an IP address is being used as expected, actively monitor network traffic originating from a prefix and assign a reputation score.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Monitoring:**

*   **Traffic Mirroring:** Implement a network tap or mirroring configuration to capture network traffic from monitored prefixes.
*   **Flow Analysis:** Analyze network flows (5-tuple: source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, protocol) for patterns indicative of malicious activity.  Example patterns include:
    *   High volume of SYN scans.
    *   Communication with known command-and-control servers (threat intelligence feeds).
    *   Data exfiltration attempts (large outbound transfers).
    *   Brute-force attacks.
*   **DNS Query Monitoring:** Monitor DNS queries originating from the prefix. Suspicious queries (e.g., domain generation algorithms, recently registered domains) contribute to a negative reputation score.
*   **SSL/TLS Inspection:** (Where legal and ethical) Inspect SSL/TLS traffic for malware signatures and suspicious content.

**2. Reputation Scoring:**

*   **Base Score:** Each prefix starts with a neutral reputation score (e.g., 50/100).
*   **Positive Signals:**  Consistent communication with known good actors (e.g., major CDNs, financial institutions) and adherence to network best practices (e.g., proper DNSSEC configuration) *increase* the score.
*   **Negative Signals:** The signals from section 1 *decrease* the score.  The degree of decrease is weighted based on the severity of the activity.
*   **Decay Mechanism:** Reputation scores decay over time.  A prefix that has been inactive or has corrected malicious behavior gradually recovers its reputation.
*   **Reputation Thresholds:** Define thresholds for different reputation levels (e.g., "Trusted," "Neutral," "Suspicious," "Blocked").

**3. Autonomous Response:**

*   **Dynamic Firewall Rules:** Integrate with network firewalls to automatically adjust rules based on reputation scores.  Prefixes with low scores can be subjected to stricter filtering or even blocked entirely.
*   **Traffic Shaping:** Shape traffic from suspicious prefixes to limit bandwidth and reduce the impact of potential attacks.
*   **Alerting & Reporting:**  Generate alerts for prefixes that exhibit significant changes in reputation or fall below a certain threshold.  Provide detailed reports on the observed activity.
*   **Automated Investigation:** Trigger automated investigation workflows to gather additional information about suspicious prefixes (e.g., WHOIS lookups, reverse DNS lookups).

**4. Pseudocode (Core Reputation Calculation):**

```
function calculate_reputation(prefix, observed_activity):
  base_score = 50
  positive_score = 0
  negative_score = 0

  for activity in observed_activity:
    if activity.type == "good_actor_communication":
      positive_score += activity.weight
    elif activity.type == "malicious_scan":
      negative_score += activity.severity
    elif activity.type == "c2_communication":
      negative_score += activity.severity * 2
    # Add more activity types and weights as needed

  decay_factor = 0.95 # Example decay rate

  current_reputation = (base_score + positive_score - negative_score) * decay_factor

  # Clamp the reputation score between 0 and 100
  current_reputation = max(0, min(100, current_reputation))

  return current_reputation
```

**5. Data Storage:**

*   A time-series database is ideal for storing reputation scores and observed activity over time.  This allows for trend analysis and historical investigation.
*   A graph database can be used to model relationships between prefixes, observed activity, and threat intelligence feeds.

**6. Enhancement: Federated Reputation:**

*   Allow multiple organizations to contribute reputation data to a shared repository.  This creates a more comprehensive and accurate view of network reputation.  Requires robust security and privacy mechanisms.
