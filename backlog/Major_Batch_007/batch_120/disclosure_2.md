## Dynamic Partition Merging & Splitting with Predictive Load Balancing

**Specification:** A system for proactively managing data partition sizes, not just reacting to splits, but *predicting* and merging/splitting based on anticipated load. This builds on the concept of splitting but moves to a dynamic, predictive model.

**Components:**

*   **Load Prediction Engine:** An AI/ML model trained on historical data access patterns (time series, query frequency, data growth), system metrics (CPU, memory, I/O), and potentially external factors (business calendar, seasonal trends). This engine outputs predicted load for each partition over a defined time horizon.
*   **Partition State Manager:** Tracks the current state of each partition (size, load, health) and the predicted future state provided by the Load Prediction Engine.
*   **Dynamic Merging/Splitting Controller:** Evaluates the Partition State Manager data. It determines if a partition should be split or merged based on thresholds (predicted load exceeding capacity, predicted load significantly below capacity, partition size imbalance).
*   **Data Router with Predictive Awareness:**  Routers updated not just with split metadata but also with information regarding *future* partition assignments based on the Dynamic Merging/Splitting Controllerâ€™s predictions. This enables pre-fetching and caching.
*   **Resource Allocation Manager:**  Handles the allocation of resources (nodes, storage) to accommodate partition merges and splits, minimizing disruption.

**Operation:**

1.  **Prediction:** The Load Prediction Engine constantly monitors and predicts load for each partition.
2.  **Evaluation:** The Dynamic Merging/Splitting Controller evaluates the current and predicted load against pre-defined thresholds.
3.  **Decision:**  If the predicted load exceeds capacity for a partition, a split is scheduled. If the predicted load is significantly below capacity for multiple partitions, a merge is scheduled.  Merge/split decisions consider overall system health and resource availability.
4.  **Pre-Routing Adjustment:**  The Data Router receives advance notice of upcoming merges/splits. It begins adapting routing tables *before* the actual operation, ensuring minimal disruption. This is critical; routing must be seamlessly adjusted.
5.  **Resource Provisioning:** The Resource Allocation Manager allocates necessary resources for the merge/split. This could involve spinning up new nodes, reallocating storage, or migrating data.
6.  **Execution:**  The merge/split is executed.
7.  **Verification:**  System health and performance are monitored to ensure the operation was successful.
8.  **Feedback Loop:**  Performance data is fed back into the Load Prediction Engine to improve its accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Merging/Splitting Controller):**

```
function evaluate_partitions(partition_states) {
  for each partition in partition_states {
    predicted_load = partition.predicted_load
    capacity = partition.capacity
    threshold_high = capacity * 0.8 // 80% capacity trigger for split
    threshold_low = capacity * 0.2 // 20% capacity trigger for merge

    if (predicted_load > threshold_high) {
      schedule_split(partition)
    } else if (predicted_load < threshold_low) {
      find_merge_candidates(partition) // find partitions with similar data characteristics
      if (merge_candidate_found) {
        schedule_merge(partition, merge_candidate)
      }
    }
  }
}

function schedule_split(partition) {
  //allocate resources, notify data router, execute split, verify
}

function schedule_merge(partition1, partition2) {
  //allocate resources, notify data router, execute merge, verify
}
```

**Novelty:** This system is *proactive* rather than *reactive*. Existing systems split partitions when they are overloaded. This system *predicts* overload and splits *before* it happens, minimizing performance impact. It also introduces the concept of proactively merging underutilized partitions, reducing resource waste. The predictive data routing is also a significant improvement.
