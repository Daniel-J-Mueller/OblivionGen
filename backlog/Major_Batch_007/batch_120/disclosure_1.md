## Adaptive Frame Prediction & Pre-Fetch via User Biofeedback

**Concept:** Leverage real-time user physiological data (heart rate variability, skin conductance, eye tracking) to *predict* viewing focus and *proactively* pre-fetch/render frames *before* they are needed. This goes beyond simple buffering and aims for a near-zero latency visual experience by anticipating user gaze and cognitive load.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:** Integration with wearable devices (smartwatches, VR/AR headsets) capable of providing:
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) – Indicator of cognitive load & attention.
    *   Skin Conductance (GSR) – Measures emotional arousal/interest.
    *   Eye Tracking – Precise gaze direction & pupil dilation (interest/effort).
*   **Data Processing Unit (Client-Side):**
    *   **Biofeedback Analyzer:**  Real-time processing of sensor data.  Algorithm calculates a “Focus Prediction Score” (FPS) based on weighted combination of HRV, GSR, and eye tracking metrics.
        *   HRV: Lower HRV = higher cognitive load (increased weight for prediction).
        *   GSR: Higher GSR = increased interest (increased weight for prediction).
        *   Eye Tracking: Gaze direction & dwell time (primary prediction signal).
    *   **Frame Prioritization Engine:**  Utilizes FPS to prioritize frame rendering & pre-fetching. Frames falling within or predicted to fall within the user’s gaze area (based on historical gaze patterns & scene analysis) receive the highest priority.
*   **Streaming Server Integration:**
    *   **Adaptive Bitrate Control (Enhanced):** Traditional bitrate switching is augmented by prediction data. Server prioritizes delivery of high-quality frames predicted to be in focus.
    *   **Frame Prefetch Queue:** Maintains a queue of pre-rendered/encoded frames based on predicted gaze trajectory and content analysis (scene changes, movement).
*   **Content Analysis Module (Server-Side):**
    *   **Saliency Mapping:**  Identifies visually salient regions in each frame to aid prediction.
    *   **Motion Vector Analysis:** Predicts areas of likely interest based on motion.
*   **Algorithm – FPS Calculation:**

```pseudocode
function calculateFPS(HRV, GSR, gazeDirection, dwellTime, saliencyMap) {
  // Normalize values to a 0-1 scale
  normalizedHRV = 1 - (HRV / maxHRV); // Lower HRV = higher score
  normalizedGSR = GSR / maxGSR; // Higher GSR = higher score
  normalizedDwellTime = dwellTime / maxDwellTime;
  saliencyScore = getSaliencyScore(gazeDirection, saliencyMap);

  // Weighted sum – weights can be adjusted based on content type/user profile
  FPS = (0.3 * normalizedHRV) + (0.2 * normalizedGSR) + (0.4 * normalizedDwellTime) + (0.1 * saliencyScore);
  return FPS;
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Data privacy is paramount. Sensor data must be anonymized & user consent obtained.
*   The system must be robust to sensor noise & inaccuracies. Kalman filtering or similar techniques can be used.
*   The weighting factors in the FPS calculation should be dynamically adjusted based on user behavior & content type.
*   The prefetch queue size needs to be optimized to balance responsiveness with memory usage.
*   Content analysis can be offloaded to edge servers to reduce server load.
