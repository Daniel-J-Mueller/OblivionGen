**Dynamic Data Provenance & Replay with Resource-Aware Sharding**

**Specification:** A system for tracking data lineage *and* facilitating selective replay of data streams based on resource availability, intended for debugging, auditing, and ‘what-if’ analysis. Extends beyond simple memory utilization to consider network bandwidth, CPU instruction sets (GPU/TPU availability), and data storage I/O.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Provenance Tracker:** Captures a complete history of data transformations. This isn't just metadata about *what* happened, but also *where* (specific compute node), *when* (timestamp), *how* (code version, parameters), and *why* (triggering event, user initiating action).  Data is structured as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  Key addition: track resource utilization *during* each transformation step (CPU cycles, memory usage, network traffic, GPU/TPU load).

2.  **Resource Broker:** Monitors the availability of compute resources across the network.  It maintains a real-time inventory of CPU, memory, GPU/TPU, and network bandwidth on each compute node. It predicts future capacity based on historical usage patterns and scheduled jobs.

3.  **Replay Engine:**  The core of the system. Given a specific data record or a time window, it can reconstruct the entire processing path through the DAG.  It uses the Resource Broker to identify available compute nodes that meet the resource requirements of each transformation step. The replay engine *shards* the processing across available nodes.

4.  **Selective Replay Policies:**  Allows users to define policies for replaying data. These policies can specify:
    *   The data range (e.g., replay the last 5 minutes, replay a specific data record).
    *   The replay speed (e.g., replay at 1x, 2x, or 0.5x speed).
    *   The target compute nodes (e.g., replay on a dedicated testing cluster).
    *   Resource constraints (e.g., limit CPU usage to 50%, use only GPU-enabled nodes).
    *   Error injection (e.g., simulate network outages or corrupted data).

**Pseudocode (Replay Engine - Shard Allocation):**

```
function allocateShards(DAG, dataRecord, resourceConstraints):
  shards = []
  for each node in DAG:
    requiredResources = node.getResourceRequirements()
    availableNodes = ResourceBroker.getAvailableNodes(requiredResources, resourceConstraints)
    if availableNodes is empty:
      //Log "Insufficient resources" and attempt node re-scheduling
      continue
    //Select best node (based on cost, latency, etc.)
    selectedNode = selectBestNode(availableNodes)
    shard = createShard(node, dataRecord, selectedNode)
    shards.append(shard)
  return shards

function createShard(node, dataRecord, computeNode):
  // Create an execution context on the computeNode
  context = createExecutionContext(computeNode, node.code, node.parameters)
  // Load dataRecord into the context
  context.loadData(dataRecord)
  // Start execution
  context.execute()
  return context
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **DAG Node:**  `{code: function, parameters: dict, resourceRequirements: dict, inputData: data, outputData: data}`
*   **Resource Requirements:** `{cpu: int, memory: int, gpu: bool, networkBandwidth: int}`
*   **ExecutionContext:** A container for executing the processing function on a specific compute node.

**Novelty:**

Traditional data stream processing focuses on *real-time* performance. This design prioritizes *observability* and *control* by enabling detailed analysis and experimentation with past data.  The resource-aware sharding allows for replay scenarios that would be impossible in a live production environment due to resource constraints. The system isn’t limited to *replay* – it facilitates “what-if” analysis by allowing users to inject errors or modify parameters during replay, enabling robust testing and debugging. The focus on tracking resource usage *during* processing enables much more accurate resource allocation and performance prediction.
