## Dynamic Hash Function Selection & ‘Bloom Filter’ Pre-Check

**Concept:** Enhance the two-stage hash scheme with dynamic hash function selection *and* a probabilistic pre-check using a Bloom filter before accessing the main hash table. This aims to reduce cache misses and computational load, especially in high-throughput network environments.

**Specs:**

1.  **Bloom Filter Stage:**
    *   Implement a Bloom filter *before* the two-stage hash lookup.
    *   Bloom filter is populated with recent hash keys (both first and second hash values) from network packets.  Size is configurable based on anticipated network load/packet rate.
    *   Upon receiving a packet, calculate both hash values (first & second).
    *   Check if *both* hash values exist in the Bloom filter.
    *   If *either* hash value is *not* present: Bypass the main hash table lookup entirely. Flag packet for a 'slow path' handling (described in section 4).
    *   If *both* hash values *are* present: Proceed to the two-stage hash lookup.

2.  **Dynamic Hash Function Selection:**
    *   Maintain a pool of multiple hash functions for both the first and second hash value generation. (e.g., MurmurHash, CityHash, FNV-1a, etc.).
    *   Implement a performance monitoring system.  Track cache miss rates, lookup times, and collision rates for each hash function in the pool, categorized by network traffic patterns (e.g., by source/destination IP range, port number, protocol).
    *   Periodically (or triggered by significant performance degradation) re-weight the selection probability of each hash function in the pool. Favor hash functions with lower measured collision/miss rates for the current traffic pattern.
    *   Each time a first/second hash value needs to be generated, use a weighted random selection to choose which hash function to use.

3.  **Two-Stage Hash Lookup (Modified):**
    *   The core two-stage hash scheme remains, but benefits from the Bloom filter pre-check.
    *   The ‘index entry’ (hash bucket) can store additional metadata beyond just hash keys. Include a ‘quality score’ for each entry, based on how recently the corresponding connection state has been updated. This helps prioritize cache eviction.

4.  **‘Slow Path’ Handling (Bloom Filter Miss):**
    *   When a packet fails the Bloom filter check:
        *   Defer immediate processing. Add the packet to a ‘deferred processing queue’.
        *   A separate thread processes the deferred queue.
        *   For packets in the deferred queue: Calculate both hash values, access the main hash table, process the connection state, *and* update the Bloom filter with both hash values.  This effectively ‘learns’ new hash key patterns.
        *   Implement a limit on the deferred queue size to prevent excessive latency. Packets exceeding the limit are dropped (with appropriate logging).

**Pseudocode (Bloom Filter Check):**

```
function process_packet(packet_data):
  hash1 = generate_first_hash(packet_data)
  hash2 = generate_second_hash(packet_data)

  if bloom_filter.contains(hash1) and bloom_filter.contains(hash2):
    // Proceed to two-stage hash lookup
    connection_state = lookup_connection_state(hash1, hash2)
    process_connection_state(connection_state, packet_data)
  else:
    // Add to deferred processing queue
    deferred_queue.add(packet_data)
```

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Hash Selection):**

```
function generate_first_hash(packet_data):
  // weights[i] = probability of using hash_function[i]
  selected_function_index = weighted_random_choice(weights)
  hash_value = hash_function[selected_function_index](packet_data)
  return hash_value
```

**Considerations:**

*   Bloom filter false positive rate needs to be carefully tuned. A higher rate reduces the number of deferred packets but increases the load on the main hash table.
*   The performance monitoring system adds overhead. It needs to be lightweight and efficient.
*   The deferred processing queue introduces latency. The queue size needs to be carefully chosen to balance latency and packet loss.
*   The dynamic hash function selection adds complexity to the system.
*   Synchronization mechanisms are needed to ensure thread safety when updating the performance monitoring system and the Bloom filter.
