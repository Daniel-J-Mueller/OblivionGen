## Dynamic Network Topology Prediction & Pre-Provisioning

**Concept:** Extend the network visualization service to *predict* future network topology changes based on observed patterns and proactively pre-provision resources. This isn't just about *showing* the current network, but anticipating its evolution.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Collection & Analysis Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate with existing monitoring tools (logs, metrics, traffic analysis) and incorporate data from client-facing systems (ticketing systems, project management software, anticipated application deployments).
*   **Pattern Recognition:** Employ time-series analysis and machine learning algorithms (LSTM, ARIMA, Bayesian networks) to identify recurring patterns in network changes. Examples: weekly batch job execution increasing resource demand, seasonal traffic surges, cyclical application updates.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement algorithms to identify deviations from established patterns, signaling potential unplanned network changes.
*   **Prediction Horizon:** Configurable prediction horizon (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week) to balance accuracy and responsiveness.
*   **Confidence Scoring:** Assign a confidence score to each prediction based on the strength of the observed patterns and the accuracy of the algorithms.

**II. Pre-Provisioning Engine:**

*   **Resource Mapping:** Define mappings between predicted network changes and required resources (VMs, containers, bandwidth, security rules).
*   **Automated Provisioning:** Utilize existing infrastructure-as-code tools (Terraform, Ansible) to automatically provision resources *before* they are needed.
*   **Staging & Activation:** Provision resources in a staging environment for validation before activating them in production.
*   **Dynamic Scaling:** Integrate with auto-scaling groups to dynamically scale resources up or down based on predicted demand.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** Implement a rollback mechanism to revert to the previous network configuration in case of prediction errors.

**III. Visualization Enhancements:**

*   **Predictive Overlay:** Display a predictive overlay on the network visualization diagram, highlighting areas where resource provisioning is anticipated.
*   **Confidence Indicators:** Use visual cues (color coding, icons) to indicate the confidence level of each prediction.
*   **"What-If" Analysis:** Allow users to simulate different scenarios (e.g., launching a new application, increasing traffic volume) and visualize the impact on the network.
*   **Alerting & Notifications:** Trigger alerts and notifications when predictions exceed predefined thresholds or when anomalies are detected.

**Pseudocode (Prediction & Provisioning):**

```
function predictNetworkChanges(historicalData, currentStatus):
  // Analyze historical data and current status
  patterns = findRecurringPatterns(historicalData)
  anomalies = detectAnomalies(currentStatus)
  predictedChanges = generatePredictions(patterns, anomalies)
  return predictedChanges

function provisionResources(predictedChanges):
  // Map predicted changes to required resources
  resourceRequirements = mapChangesToResources(predictedChanges)

  //Provision resources (Terraform, Ansible)
  provisionResources(resourceRequirements)
  return

function mainLoop():
  while true:
    currentStatus = getNetworkStatus()
    historicalData = loadHistoricalData()
    predictedChanges = predictNetworkChanges(historicalData, currentStatus)
    if predictedChanges:
      provisionResources(predictedChanges)
    sleep(60) // Check every minute
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond reactive network visualization to *proactive* network management. It anticipates changes and pre-provisions resources, improving performance and reducing downtime.  Existing systems typically focus on monitoring and responding to changes *after* they occur.
