## Adaptive Resource Prefetching & Dynamic Sharding

**Concept:** Extending the long-lived connection paradigm to proactively prefetch and dynamically shard content *before* a client request, anticipating user needs based on probabilistic models and connection-level data. This moves beyond simple request/response to a predictive, multi-threaded delivery system.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Resource Manager (PRM) – residing on the network server.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `ClientProfile`: Stores historical request data (URLs, timestamps, device type, location), probabilistic model of future requests (e.g., Markov chain), preferred content types, connection quality metrics (RTT, packet loss).
    *   `ResourceShard`: A segmented portion of a resource (e.g., webpage, image, video). Each shard has a unique ID and dependency list (other required shards).
    *   `PrefetchQueue`: A prioritized queue of `ResourceShard` IDs for each client, based on the probabilistic model and resource dependency graph.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Profile Creation/Update:** Upon initial connection or significant behavior change, the PRM creates or updates a `ClientProfile` based on observed requests and client-reported metadata.
    2.  **Probabilistic Modeling:**  The `ClientProfile` utilizes a Markov chain (or more advanced model) to predict the likelihood of a client requesting a specific resource shard. This is continuously updated with each request.
    3.  **Prefetch Scheduling:**  Based on the probabilistic model, the PRM populates a `PrefetchQueue` for each client with prioritized `ResourceShard` IDs. The queue size is dynamically adjusted based on connection quality and server load.
    4.  **Dynamic Sharding:**  Resources are dynamically broken down into `ResourceShard`s based on content type, size, and dependency graph.  Sharding is optimized for parallel delivery.
    5.  **Parallel Prefetching:** The network server utilizes multiple threads to prefetch `ResourceShard`s from various sources (web servers, CDNs, databases) and store them in a shared cache.
    6.  **Persistent Connection Delivery:** When a client requests a resource, the network server checks if the required `ResourceShard`s are available in the cache. If so, they are delivered immediately over the long-lived connection.  If not, the request is added to the prefetch queue for future delivery.  Delivery is multi-threaded, sending available shards as soon as they are ready.
    7.  **Client-Side Assembly:** The client receives `ResourceShard`s out of order and assembles them into the complete resource. This requires a client-side assembly engine.
    8.  **Connection-Level Feedback:**  The client sends feedback to the server about the received `ResourceShard`s (acknowledgement, errors, latency). This data is used to refine the probabilistic model and optimize the prefetching algorithm.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
// On Connection Establishment
clientProfile = createClientProfile(clientId)
prefetchQueue = createPrefetchQueue(clientId)

// On Client Request
resourceId = extractResourceId(request)
shardList = getShardList(resourceId)

if shardInCache(shardList):
    sendShardsOverConnection(shardList)
else:
    addToPrefetchQueue(shardList)

// Background Thread - Prefetching
while (true):
    if not prefetchQueue.isEmpty():
        shardList = prefetchQueue.dequeue()
        prefetchResources(shardList)
        storeInCache(shardList)
```

**Client-Side Requirements:**

*   Assembly Engine – to reconstruct resources from `ResourceShard`s.
*   Connection Management – to handle the long-lived connection and feedback messages.
*   Priority Handling – to prioritize assembly based on dependency graphs.
