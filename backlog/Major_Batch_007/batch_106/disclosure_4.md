## Adaptive Anomaly Contextualization via Synthetic Data Generation

**Concept:** Expand the hierarchical anomaly scoring system by integrating a synthetic data generation module. This module will dynamically create synthetic operational data points *around* detected anomalies, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the anomaly’s *context* and potential impact, moving beyond simple scoring to proactive prediction.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Name:** Anomaly Context Generator (ACG)
*   **Integration Point:** ACG resides downstream of the metric processing component’s anomaly score generation, acting on identified anomalies (system, component, group levels).
*   **Synthetic Data Engine:** Based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, specifically a Conditional GAN (cGAN). The 'condition' will be the identified anomaly and the preceding N data points of associated metrics.
*   **Input:**
    *   Anomaly Score Hierarchy (System, Component, Group levels)
    *   Associated Metric Time Series Data (preceding N data points)
    *   System Configuration Metadata (VM type, application profile, etc.)
*   **Output:**
    *   Synthetic Metric Time Series Data:  A time series representing what the metrics *would likely* have looked like if the anomaly hadn’t occurred, and projections of what they *might* look like *with* the anomaly continuing/escalating.  Multiple synthetic series will be generated – ‘baseline’ (no anomaly), ‘continued anomaly’, and ‘escalated anomaly’.
    *   Anomaly Context Report: A report detailing the synthesized data, confidence intervals associated with predictions, and a risk assessment based on projected impact.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION GenerateAnomalyContext(anomaly_score_hierarchy, metric_time_series, system_metadata):

  // 1. Prepare data for GAN training
  training_data = PrepareGANData(metric_time_series, anomaly_score_hierarchy) // Combines time series with anomaly flag/score

  // 2. Train/Load Conditional GAN
  IF GAN_MODEL_EXISTS:
    LOAD GAN_MODEL
  ELSE:
    TRAIN GAN_MODEL WITH training_data // Train cGAN to predict metric values based on historical data *and* anomaly state.

  // 3. Generate Synthetic Data
  synthetic_baseline = GENERATE_SYNTHETIC_DATA(GAN_MODEL, historical_data, anomaly_state=FALSE)
  synthetic_continued = GENERATE_SYNTHETIC_DATA(GAN_MODEL, historical_data, anomaly_state=TRUE)
  synthetic_escalated = GENERATE_SYNTHETIC_DATA(GAN_MODEL, historical_data, anomaly_state=TRUE, escalation_factor=1.2) // Example escalation

  // 4. Calculate Impact Metrics
  impact_baseline = CalculateImpact(historical_data, synthetic_baseline) // Difference between actual and predicted (baseline)
  impact_continued = CalculateImpact(historical_data, synthetic_continued)
  impact_escalated = CalculateImpact(historical_data, synthetic_escalated)

  // 5. Generate Anomaly Context Report
  report = CreateAnomalyContextReport(anomaly_score_hierarchy, impact_baseline, impact_continued, impact_escalated)

  RETURN report

FUNCTION CalculateImpact(actual_data, synthetic_data):
  // Calculate metrics like:
  // - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  // - Percentage Deviation
  // - Potential Service Degradation (based on metric thresholds)

  RETURN impact_metrics

FUNCTION CreateAnomalyContextReport(anomaly_hierarchy, baseline_impact, continued_impact, escalated_impact):
  // Combine all data into a report with visualizations and risk assessment.
  // Include confidence intervals for predictions.

  RETURN report
```

**Refinements:**

*   **Adaptive GAN Training:**  The GAN should be continuously retrained with new operational data to improve prediction accuracy and adapt to changing system behavior.
*   **Multi-Metric Correlation:** Integrate correlation analysis into the GAN training process to capture complex relationships between different metrics.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI) Integration:**  Utilize XAI techniques to understand *why* the GAN is making certain predictions and provide insights into the root cause of anomalies.
*   **Simulation Environment:** Create a simulation environment where the synthetic data can be used to test the effectiveness of different remediation strategies *before* deploying them to the live system.
