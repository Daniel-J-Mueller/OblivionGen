## Adaptive Multi-Stream Prioritization & Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Dynamically prioritize and buffer video streams not just based on network conditions *between* the streaming media device and the source (access point/transmitter), but also based on *predicted* user viewing patterns *within* the video content itself. This goes beyond simple bitrate adaptation.

**Specs:**

*   **Content Analysis Module:** Integrated AI-powered content analysis. This module operates *before* playback, analyzing video to identify scenes with high motion, complex textures, or rapid cuts (likely requiring higher bandwidth). It generates a "Complexity Map" associated with the video file. This map isn't just an average; it’s a timestamped series of complexity scores.
*   **Viewing Pattern Prediction:** The device learns user viewing habits. This isn't just about *what* they watch, but *how*. Do they frequently rewind, fast-forward, or pause during action sequences?  Do they favor specific camera angles (requiring higher resolution for those moments)?  This is a localized, individual user profile, stored *on* the streaming media device.
*   **Multi-Stream Encoding Support:** Requires support for multiple, simultaneously downloaded video streams – a "base" layer (low resolution/bitrate) *plus* enhancement layers (additional detail, smoothness, etc.). These aren’t just different bitrates of the same content; they represent incremental additions of visual information.
*   **Predictive Buffer Management:** The core innovation. The device doesn’t just buffer *ahead* based on network conditions. It *anticipates* bandwidth needs based on the Complexity Map *and* the user’s Viewing Pattern Prediction.
    *   During low-complexity scenes, the device prioritizes downloading *future* enhancement layers to pre-build the visual experience.
    *   When the Complexity Map predicts a high-bandwidth scene *and* the user’s history suggests a propensity to rewind/re-watch, the device aggressively pre-buffers *multiple* enhancement layers and even *complete* alternate streams (e.g., different camera angles) for instant access.
*   **Dynamic Stream Switching:** The system can seamlessly switch between pre-buffered streams (different camera angles, resolutions) *during* playback, entirely masking any potential network hiccups.
*   **Remote Control Integration:** The remote control can be used to "preview" alternate streams (camera angles, perspectives) – triggering pre-buffering of that stream if the user shows interest.
*   **API for Content Providers:**  A standardized API allowing content providers to include "hints" within the video file itself – highlighting specific scenes or sections that benefit from aggressive pre-buffering or alternate stream availability.
* **Bandwidth Negotiation**: The device will negotiate bandwidth limits with the source (AP/Transmitter) to determine if bandwidth is sufficient to implement the adaptive Multi-Stream Prioritization & Predictive Buffering. If it is not, a lower quality service is provided.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Initialization
Load User Viewing Profile
Load Video Complexity Map
Negotiate Bandwidth Limits with Source

// Playback Loop
While (Playback Active) {
  CurrentTimestamp = GetCurrentPlaybackTimestamp()
  ComplexityScore = GetComplexityScoreFromMap(CurrentTimestamp)
  PredictedUserAction = PredictUserAction(CurrentTimestamp) // Rewind, Pause, etc.

  // Adjust Buffering Priority
  If (ComplexityScore > Threshold) {
    Prioritize Enhancement Layer Download
    If (PredictedUserAction == Rewind) {
      PreDownload Alternate Stream
    }
  } Else {
    Prioritize Future Enhancement Layer Download
  }

  // Check Buffer Status & Request Data
  If (Buffer Low) {
    Request Data Based on Prioritized Streams
  }
}
```

This system moves beyond reactive buffering to proactive, predictive buffering, aiming to provide a truly seamless and immersive viewing experience. It relies on combining content analysis, user behavior prediction, and multi-stream encoding to anticipate and fulfill bandwidth needs *before* they become a problem.
