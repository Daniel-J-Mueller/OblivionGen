## Adaptive Partition Granularity Based on Query Patterns

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This design introduces a system for dynamically adjusting partition granularity – splitting or merging partitions – *not* solely based on resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O), but *directly* based on observed query patterns.  The existing patent focuses on heat/resource-driven scaling. This focuses on *query-driven* scaling, anticipating workload rather than reacting to it.  The goal is to optimize for query latency and throughput *before* resource contention occurs.

**II. Components:**

1.  **Query Pattern Analyzer:**  A module responsible for capturing and analyzing incoming queries.
2.  **Query Profile Database:** Stores abstracted query profiles – identifying common access patterns (time ranges, spatial filters, data aggregations).
3.  **Granularity Adjustment Engine:**  A component that, based on query profiles, recommends and initiates partition splits/merges.
4.  **Partition Manager:**  Responsible for physically executing split/merge operations.
5.  **Metadata Store:** Maintains mapping between logical data views and physical partitions.

**III. Operation:**

1.  **Query Capture & Abstraction:** The Query Pattern Analyzer intercepts incoming queries, removing sensitive data (user IDs, specific values) and extracting key characteristics:
    *   Time range requested.
    *   Spatial boundaries (if applicable).
    *   Aggregation functions (sum, average, count, etc.).
    *   Filtering criteria (e.g., `temperature > 80`).
    *   Query frequency.

2.  **Profile Creation/Update:** The extracted characteristics are used to create or update query profiles in the Query Profile Database.  Profiles are clustered based on similarity.

3.  **Granularity Recommendation:** The Granularity Adjustment Engine periodically (or on-demand) evaluates the Query Profile Database.  It assesses whether current partition boundaries align with common query patterns.
    *   **Split Recommendation:** If many queries consistently request data crossing a specific partition boundary, the engine recommends splitting that partition.
    *   **Merge Recommendation:** If multiple partitions are frequently accessed together by numerous queries, the engine recommends merging them.

4.  **Partition Adjustment:** The Granularity Adjustment Engine sends requests to the Partition Manager to perform the recommended splits or merges.

5.  **Metadata Update:** The Metadata Store is updated to reflect the new partition boundaries.

**IV. Pseudocode (Granularity Adjustment Engine - Simplified):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION recommend_adjustments(query_profile_database, current_metadata)
  profiles = query_profile_database.get_most_frequent_profiles()
  
  FOR EACH profile IN profiles
    
    // Identify partitions frequently crossed by the profile's queries
    crossed_partitions = identify_crossed_partitions(profile, current_metadata)

    // Check if splitting improves performance
    IF crossed_partitions.count > threshold AND  performance_gain(crossed_partitions, current_metadata) > splitting_cost()
      recommend_split(crossed_partitions)
    
    // Check if merging improves performance
    IF adjacent_partitions_frequently_accessed(adjacent_partitions) AND performance_gain(adjacent_partitions, current_metadata) > merging_cost()
      recommend_merge(adjacent_partitions)
      
  END FOR
  
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION performance_gain(partitions, current_metadata):
  //Estimate latency reduction and throughput increase.
  //Requires a predictive query execution model.
  RETURN estimated_performance_improvement
END FUNCTION
```

**V.  Considerations:**

*   **Predictive Modeling:** The accuracy of performance gain estimations is crucial.  A robust query execution model is needed.
*   **Overhead:** Partition splits and merges are resource-intensive operations.  Careful cost-benefit analysis is required.
*   **Concurrency:**  Managing concurrent partition adjustments is complex.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** The `threshold` and cost functions should be dynamically adjusted based on system load and performance characteristics.
*   **Cold Starts:**  Initial query profiles may be inaccurate.  A learning period is needed.
