## Adaptive Stream Stitching with Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Extend the seamless stream replacement concept by *predictively* buffering portions of the incoming stream *before* the designated splice point. This aims to reduce latency and eliminate even micro-stuttering that might occur during the actual switch, even with aligned IDR frames.  The system doesnâ€™t just *react* to the splice request; it *prepares* for it.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Source Stream Analyzers (SSA):**  Two instances, one for each stream (primary & secondary).  SSAs monitor incoming streams for key metadata (timestamps, GOP structure, scene changes).
*   **Predictive Buffer Manager (PBM):** Central control unit. Receives splice requests, manages buffer allocation, and orchestrates stream switching.
*   **Adaptive Buffers (AB):** Dedicated memory blocks associated with each stream, dynamically sized based on PBM instructions.
*   **Stream Stitcher (SS):**  Responsible for the final stream assembly and output. Receives stitched stream segments from PBM.

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Splice Request Reception:** PBM receives a splice request specifying the target time/location within the output stream.
2.  **Predictive Buffer Allocation:**  PBM calculates the buffer size needed for the secondary stream, based on the time to the splice point, the bit rate of the secondary stream, and a configurable latency target (e.g., 50ms). It allocates Adaptive Buffer space.
3.  **Pre-Fetch & Buffer Fill:**  SSAs instruct the secondary stream source to pre-fetch data and fill the Adaptive Buffer.  The pre-fetch starts *before* the splice time, aiming to have several seconds of buffered content.  This is done in parallel with the ongoing primary stream delivery.
4.  **Synchronization Point Detection:** SSAs continuously analyze the secondary stream for synchronization points (IDR frames with complete timestamps).  The PBM identifies the ideal frame to transition to, minimizing disruption.  Ideally, the timestamp is as close to the splice point as possible.
5.  **Aligned Frame Insertion (Existing):**  The primary & secondary encoders receive instructions to insert aligned splice point frames, as per the original patent, but now *after* the buffer is pre-populated.
6.  **Seamless Transition:** At the splice point:
    *   PBM signals SS to halt processing of the primary stream segments.
    *   SS begins outputting segments from the pre-buffered secondary stream, starting with the chosen synchronization point.
    *   The aligned splice point frames ensure seamless frame dependency.
7.  **Dynamic Buffer Adjustment:**  PBM monitors buffer occupancy and dynamically adjusts the pre-fetch rate of the secondary stream to maintain sufficient buffer headroom.
8.  **Error Handling:** If pre-fetching fails or buffer occupancy falls below a threshold, the system can gracefully degrade to the original buffering approach or signal an error.

**3. Pseudocode (PBM Core Logic):**

```pseudocode
function handleSpliceRequest(spliceTime, secondaryStreamSource):
  bufferSize = calculateBufferSize(spliceTime, secondaryStreamSource.bitrate, latencyTarget)
  allocateBuffer(bufferSize)
  startPrefetch(secondaryStreamSource, bufferSize)

  synchronizationPoint = findBestSynchronizationPoint(secondaryStreamSource)

  when currentTime == spliceTime:
    haltPrimaryStream()
    outputSynchronizationPoint(synchronizationPoint)
    switchToSecondaryStream()
  end when

  monitorBufferOccupancy()
  adjustPrefetchRate()
end function

function calculateBufferSize(spliceTime, bitrate, latencyTarget):
  // Calculate buffer size based on splice time, bitrate, and desired latency
  bufferSize = (spliceTime * bitrate) + (latencyTarget * bitrate)
  return bufferSize
end function
```

**4.  Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Content-Aware Buffering:** Analyze the content of both streams to prioritize buffering of visually complex segments or scenes.
*   **Multi-Path Redundancy:** Use multiple network paths to pre-fetch the secondary stream, improving reliability.
*   **AI-Powered Frame Selection:** Train an AI model to identify optimal synchronization points based on perceptual quality and minimize visible artifacts.
