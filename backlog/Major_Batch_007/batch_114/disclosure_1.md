## Dynamic Packet Prioritization via Learned Contextual Weighting

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the credit-based policing mechanism to incorporate dynamically learned weights assigned to different packet flows based on real-time network conditions and application-specific requirements. This allows for intelligent prioritization *within* the allowed bandwidth, rather than simple drop/forward decisions.

**II. Hardware Components:**

*   **Credit Management Unit (CMU):** (Existing from Patent) Manages credit allocation and depletion for each flow.
*   **Flow Classification & Feature Extraction Module (FCFEM):** Identifies packet flows and extracts relevant features. Features include:
    *   Source/Destination IP/Port
    *   Protocol Type
    *   Packet Size
    *   Inter-Arrival Time
    *   DSCP/ToS markings
*   **Weight Learning Engine (WLE):** A small neural network (e.g., a multi-layer perceptron) that learns optimal weights for each flow.
*   **Weighted Credit Aggregator (WCA):**  Combines credits from the CMU with learned weights from the WLE.

**III. Software/Algorithm:**

1.  **Flow Identification:** FCFEM identifies the packet flow based on a 5-tuple (Source IP, Destination IP, Source Port, Destination Port, Protocol).
2.  **Feature Vector Creation:** FCFEM creates a feature vector representing the current network conditions and characteristics of the packet.
3.  **Weight Prediction:** WLE receives the feature vector as input and predicts a weight for the flow (between 0 and 1). This weight reflects the importance of the flow at the current moment. The network is trained offline with historical data or using reinforcement learning online.
4.  **Weighted Credit Calculation:** WCA multiplies the available credits for the flow (from CMU) by the predicted weight. This results in a *weighted credit balance*.
5.  **Forwarding Decision:**  The packet is forwarded if the weighted credit balance is sufficient to cover the packet’s cost (based on size or other metrics). If not, the packet is either dropped or placed in a queue for potential later forwarding.  The credit depletion is proportional to the packet’s cost and the learned weight.

**IV. Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization (Offline Training or Online RL)
Train WLE with historical data or RL reward function

// Per-Packet Processing

// 1. Flow Identification & Feature Extraction
flowID = IdentifyFlow(packet)
features = ExtractFeatures(packet, flowID)

// 2. Weight Prediction
weight = WLE.predict(features)

// 3. Credit Management
availableCredits = CMU.GetCredits(flowID)
weightedCredits = availableCredits * weight

// 4. Forwarding Decision
packetCost = CalculatePacketCost(packet)

IF weightedCredits >= packetCost THEN
    ForwardPacket(packet)
    CMU.ConsumeCredits(flowID, packetCost)
ELSE
    //Option 1: Drop Packet
    DropPacket(packet)

    //Option 2: Queue Packet for later consideration
    EnqueuePacket(packet, flowID)
ENDIF
```

**V. Refinements & Extensions:**

*   **Hierarchical Weighting:**  Introduce multiple layers of weighting.  For example, a global weight based on network congestion, a regional weight based on geographical location, and a flow-specific weight based on application type.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically adjust the weights based on network performance metrics (e.g., latency, throughput).
*   **Predictive Weighting:** Use machine learning to predict future network conditions and adjust the weights proactively.
*   **Flow Grouping:**  Group similar flows together and apply a single weight to the group. This can reduce the complexity of the WLE.
*   **Quality of Service (QoS) Integration:** Integrate with existing QoS mechanisms to provide a more comprehensive solution.
