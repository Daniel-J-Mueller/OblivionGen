## Secure Hardware Attestation via Dynamic Root of Trust & Per-Peripheral Counter Chains

**Concept:** Extend the secure counter mechanism to not just detect *attempts* at modification, but to actively establish and dynamically validate a Root of Trust (RoT) for *each* peripheral device connected to the system. This moves beyond simply flagging unauthorized configuration changes to creating a continually verified hardware identity and configuration state.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Component: Secure Peripheral Attestation Module (SPAM)**

*   **Location:** Integrated within the system’s chipset, ideally alongside the PCI/PCIe bus controllers.  Potentially implemented as a dedicated crypto-accelerator.
*   **Function:** Manages per-peripheral secure counters, cryptographic key generation/storage, and attestation processes.
*   **Features:**
    *   True Random Number Generator (TRNG) for key generation.
    *   Secure Storage:  Physically unclonable function (PUF) based key storage.
    *   Cryptographic Engine: AES, SHA-256 minimum.
    *   Communication Interface: Dedicated, secure communication channel with each peripheral (described below).

**2. Peripheral Communication & Counter Chain**

*   **Secure Channel:** Each peripheral supports a dedicated, secure communication channel with the SPAM. This could be implemented using I2C/SPI with encryption, or a dedicated hardware pin set.
*   **Counter Chain:** Each peripheral maintains *multiple* secure counters:
    *   **Configuration Counter:** Tracks changes to configurable parameters (firmware, settings).
    *   **Operational Counter:** Incremented with each significant operation performed by the peripheral (data transfer, processing cycle).
    *   **Health Counter:**  Monitored by built-in self-tests, incremented on error detection.
*   **Initial Attestation:** Upon peripheral connection/boot:
    1.  SPAM challenges the peripheral for identity.
    2.  Peripheral responds with digitally signed credentials + initial counter values (Configuration, Operational, Health).
    3.  SPAM verifies signature & stores initial counter values as the ‘expected state’.

**3. Dynamic Root of Trust Validation**

*   **Periodic Attestation:** SPAM periodically challenges peripherals for current counter values.
*   **Attestation Process:**
    1.  Peripheral transmits *all* counter values.
    2.  SPAM compares received values with stored expected values.
    3.  If discrepancies exist:
        *   **Minor Discrepancy (Configuration Counter):**  Potential authorized modification. Log event, update expected value if authorized.
        *   **Significant Discrepancy (Operational/Health Counter):**  Indicates potential compromise or malfunction. Trigger pre-defined response (isolation, logging, shutdown).
    4.  SPAM re-signs peripheral credentials based on current counter values to dynamically establish the RoT.
*   **Chain of Trust:** Establish a cascading RoT: Host OS trusts SPAM, SPAM trusts peripherals, peripherals trust their own internal components.

**4. Pseudocode: Attestation Process (SPAM Perspective)**

```pseudocode
function attestPeripheral(peripheralID):
  requestCounters = sendRequest(peripheralID, COUNTER_REQUEST)
  receivedCounters = receiveResponse(requestCounters)

  if (validateSignature(receivedCounters)):
    configCounterDiff = receivedCounters.configCounter - storedCounters.configCounter
    operationalCounterDiff = receivedCounters.operationalCounter - storedCounters.operationalCounter
    healthCounterDiff = receivedCounters.healthCounter - storedCounters.healthCounter

    if (configCounterDiff > 0 AND isAuthorizedConfigChange(configCounterDiff)):
      storedCounters.configCounter = receivedCounters.configCounter
    elif (operationalCounterDiff > 0 OR healthCounterDiff > 0):
      triggerResponse(peripheralID, COUNTER_MISMATCH)
      // Isolation, logging, etc.
    else:
      //Counters are valid
      pass

    updateStoredCounters(receivedCounters)
  else:
    //Signature verification failed.
    triggerResponse(peripheralID, COUNTER_MISMATCH)
```

**5.  Extended Considerations**

*   **Remote Attestation:** Enable remote verification of system integrity.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** Tie attestation results to policy decisions (access control, feature activation).
*   **Firmware Update Security:**  Ensure firmware updates are signed and verified *before* application.
*   **Multi-Level Counters:** Implement more granular counters for specific configuration parameters or operational functions.
