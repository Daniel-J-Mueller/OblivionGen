## Multi-Camera Predictive Tracking & Anomaly Detection

**System Overview:** A distributed system leveraging multiple, non-overlapping camera feeds to predict object trajectories and identify anomalous behavior *before* it fully manifests within any single camera’s field of view. This builds upon the presented patent’s core concept of cross-camera label recognition, but shifts from reactive identification to *proactive* prediction and intervention.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Camera Network:** Existing or new network of non-overlapping cameras providing synchronized video streams. Synchronization is crucial – network-level time stamping and stream alignment are required.

2.  **Edge Processing Units (EPUs):** Small, local compute devices connected to each camera, responsible for initial object detection and tracking *within* that camera's frame. Utilizes lightweight, optimized models for speed.

3.  **Trajectory Prediction Engine (TPE):**  A centralized service responsible for receiving trajectory snippets from EPUs, merging them across cameras, and generating predicted trajectories.  This is the ‘brain’ of the system.

4.  **Anomaly Detection Module (ADM):**  Monitors predicted trajectories against established behavioral norms and flags anomalies.

5.  **Intervention System (IS):**  Allows for automated or manual intervention based on detected anomalies. (e.g., alerts, automated camera panning, triggering other systems).

**Data Flow & Processing:**

1.  **Detection & Tracking (EPUs):** Each EPU runs a real-time object detection/tracking model (e.g., YOLO, DeepSORT). It identifies objects, generates bounding boxes, and assigns unique IDs. Each object’s position and velocity are recorded as a trajectory snippet.

2.  **Trajectory Snippet Transmission:** EPUs transmit trajectory snippets to the TPE via a secure network connection. Snippets include: object ID, timestamp, 2D/3D position, velocity, confidence score.

3.  **Trajectory Merging & Prediction (TPE):**

    *   The TPE receives snippets from multiple EPUs.
    *   It uses object ID and timestamps to correlate snippets from different cameras.
    *   **Kalman Filtering with Cross-Camera Constraints:** Kalman filters are applied to smooth and predict object trajectories. *Crucially*, cross-camera constraints are added to the Kalman filter. These constraints enforce trajectory continuity across camera boundaries.  If an object is seen entering one camera’s view, the Kalman filter will predict its likely path as it *exits* that camera and *enters* another.
    *   **Trajectory Graph:** The TPE maintains a graph of predicted trajectories. Nodes represent objects, and edges represent predicted paths.

4.  **Anomaly Detection (ADM):**

    *   The ADM analyzes the trajectory graph.
    *   **Behavioral Models:** It uses pre-trained or dynamically learned behavioral models to define ‘normal’ trajectories for different object types. (e.g., pedestrians typically follow sidewalks, vehicles stay within lanes).
    *   **Anomaly Scoring:** Deviations from normal trajectories are scored based on factors like:
        *   **Trajectory Sharpness:** Abrupt changes in direction.
        *   **Proximity to Restricted Areas:** Entering no-go zones.
        *   **Speed Anomalies:** Unexpected acceleration or deceleration.
        *   **Interaction Anomalies:**  Unexpected interactions between objects.
    *   **Alerting:**  Anomalies exceeding a threshold trigger alerts.

5.  **Intervention (IS):**

    *   **Automated Actions:**  Automated actions can be triggered based on anomaly type (e.g., pan cameras to track an anomalous object, send alerts to security personnel).
    *   **Manual Override:** Security personnel can manually review alerts and take appropriate action.

**Pseudocode (TPE - Trajectory Prediction):**

```
function predictTrajectory(objectID, cameraID, currentPosition, currentVelocity, timestamp):
    snippet = getLatestSnippets(objectID, cameraID, timestamp) // Fetch recent data
    
    if snippet exists:
        kalmanFilter = loadKalmanFilter(objectID) // Load or create filter
        kalmanFilter.update(snippet) // Update filter with new data
        predictedPosition = kalmanFilter.predict(timestamp + predictionHorizon) // Predict future position
        
        //Apply Cross-Camera Constraints
        neighborCameras = getNeighborCameras(cameraID)
        for camera in neighborCameras:
            neighborSnippet = getLatestSnippets(objectID, camera, timestamp)
            if neighborSnippet exists:
                applyConstraint(kalmanFilter, neighborSnippet)
    else:
        predictedPosition = extrapolate(currentPosition, currentVelocity) //Basic extrapolation if no data
        
    return predictedPosition
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simple label recognition to provide *proactive* prediction and anomaly detection. The cross-camera constraints within the Kalman filter allow for more accurate trajectory prediction, even when objects are briefly occluded or move between cameras. The focus on *prediction* enables intervention *before* an event fully unfolds, offering a significant advantage over reactive systems.
