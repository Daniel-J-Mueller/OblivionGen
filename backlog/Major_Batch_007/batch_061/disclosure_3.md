## Personalized Recommendation "Mood" Selection

**Concept:** Extend the multi-recommender system to allow users to *actively select* a "mood" or desired outcome for their recommendations. This isn’t simply filtering (e.g., “show me only comedies”), but influencing *how* the recommenders weigh their factors.

**Specs:**

1.  **Mood Database:** A database of pre-defined "moods". Each mood is a vector of weights applied to the existing recommenders.  Examples:
    *   "Surprise Me": High weight on serendipity/novelty recommenders, low weight on "completion" or "safe bet" recommenders.
    *   "Comfort/Relaxation": High weight on recommenders identifying previously enjoyed items, low weight on anything "challenging" or requiring effort.
    *   "Productivity/Learning": High weight on recommenders identifying educational content or tools.
    *   "Social Connection": High weight on recommenders identifying items shareable with friends or relevant to social trends.
2.  **Mood Selection Interface:** A user interface (app, website) that presents the mood options visually (icons, short descriptive text).  The interface allows users to select one or more moods.
3.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** Upon mood selection, the system retrieves the corresponding weight vector. This vector is applied to the weights within the normalization engine (as described in claim 1), *overriding* or adjusting the default weights. This is not a static change; the system continuously adjusts weights based on the selected mood.
4.  **Mood "Blending":** Allow users to "blend" multiple moods by specifying a percentage weight for each. (e.g., 70% "Comfort", 30% "Surprise Me"). The system averages the corresponding weight vectors accordingly.
5.  **Mood Learning:** The system tracks which moods a user selects and their subsequent interactions with recommendations.  Use this data to *learn* a personalized mood profile for the user, pre-selecting moods based on context (time of day, recent activity, etc.).
6. **Mood Generation:** Allow users to create custom moods by adjusting the weights of individual recommenders directly. This exposes the "under the hood" customization for power users.
7.  **Mood-Specific Reason Generation:** Modify the reason generation component to tailor the explanations to the selected mood. For example, if the user selected "Surprise Me," the reason might be, "This item is different from anything you've seen before."

**Pseudocode (Normalization Engine Modification):**

```
function normalize_scores(candidate_recommendations, recommender_scores, user_mood):
  // Get default recommender weights
  default_weights = get_default_recommender_weights()

  // Get mood-specific weights. If user has custom mood, use that, else use preset
  mood_weights = get_mood_weights(user_mood)

  // Apply mood weights to default weights
  adjusted_weights = apply_mood_weights(default_weights, mood_weights)

  //Apply weights to scores
  for each recommendation in candidate_recommendations:
    weighted_score = 0
    for each recommender in recommenders:
      weighted_score += recommender.score * adjusted_weights[recommender]
    recommendation.normalized_score = weighted_score

  return candidate_recommendations
```

**Expansion potential:**  Integrate with external mood-detecting sensors (e.g., wearable devices) to automatically adjust the recommendation moods based on the user's emotional state. Consider a "mood playlist" feature where users can create sequences of moods to be applied over time.
