## Dynamic Item ‘Mood’ & Predictive Association

**Concept:** Extend the extrapolation concept to incorporate a ‘mood’ or contextual state associated with items, and use this to dynamically adjust association strengths and predict user needs *before* explicit search queries are entered.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on connecting searches to items, primarily *after* a search is initiated.  What if we could predict likely item interests *before* the search, based on inferred user mood/context, and proactively suggest items? This moves beyond reactive search to proactive assistance.

**Specs:**

**1. Mood/Context Inference Engine:**

*   **Input:** User data streams (browsing history, purchase history, location, time of day, calendar events, social media feeds - optional and privacy-controlled, device sensor data - accelerometer, gyroscope).
*   **Processing:** Machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks, transformers) trained to infer user ‘mood’ or context (e.g., “relaxed,” “productive,” “stressed,” “exploratory,” "gift-seeking").  Output is a probability distribution over predefined mood states.
*   **Output:** A vector representing the current user mood state.

**2. Item ‘Mood’ Tagging System:**

*   **Data Source:** Item metadata (descriptions, reviews, tags, images, video).
*   **Processing:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) models (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic modeling) to identify the ‘mood’ or emotional tone associated with each item.  Image/video analysis can contribute to mood assessment.
*   **Output:** Each item is tagged with a mood vector, representing its emotional characteristics.

**3. Predictive Association Engine:**

*   **Input:** User mood vector (from 1), Item mood vectors (from 2), existing behavior-based & substitutability associations (from patent), historical data of user interactions with items tagged with specific moods.
*   **Processing:** 
    1.  Calculate a ‘mood compatibility score’ between the user’s current mood and each item’s mood. This could be a cosine similarity between mood vectors.
    2.  Adjust the strength of existing associations based on mood compatibility.  If an item is strongly associated with a search query *and* has high mood compatibility with the user, its association strength is increased.  Conversely, if mood compatibility is low, the association strength is decreased.
    3.  Generate a ranked list of ‘predicted’ items based on adjusted association strengths.
    4.  Implement a time decay factor. Predictions should reflect recent user interactions more heavily.
*   **Output:** Ranked list of items predicted to be of interest to the user.

**4. Proactive Display System:**

*   **Display:**  Items from the ranked list are displayed to the user *before* they initiate a search. This could be in the form of personalized recommendations on a homepage, push notifications, or within a dedicated ‘mood-based’ discovery section of the platform.
*   **User Feedback:** Capture user feedback on displayed items (e.g., clicks, purchases, dismissals) to refine the mood inference and prediction models.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Constantly A/B test different display strategies and prediction algorithms to optimize user engagement and conversion rates.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// User Mood Inference
user_mood = InferMood(user_data)

// Item Mood Tagging
item_moods = TagItemMoods(item_data)

// Calculate Adjusted Association Strengths
for each item in item_catalog:
  mood_compatibility = CalculateMoodCompatibility(user_mood, item_moods[item])
  adjusted_association_strength = original_association_strength * mood_compatibility

// Rank Predicted Items
predicted_items = RankItems(adjusted_association_strength)

// Display to User
DisplayItems(predicted_items)

// Capture Feedback
feedback = CaptureUserFeedback()

// Refine Models
RefineModels(feedback)
```
