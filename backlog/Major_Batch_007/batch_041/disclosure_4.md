## Adaptive Anomaly Contextualization via Multi-Dimensional Behavioral Profiling

**System Overview:**

This system expands upon the idea of forecasting to not just *predict* expected behavior, but to build a dynamic, multi-dimensional profile of *normal* behavior, incorporating not just numerical metrics, but also categorical and event-based data. It then uses this profile to contextualize anomalies, assessing their severity and potential impact *beyond* simple threshold breaches.

**Components:**

1.  **Data Ingestion & Feature Engineering Module:**
    *   Accepts time-series data (numerical metrics - CPU usage, memory, network traffic), categorical data (user roles, application types), and event logs (login/logout, error messages, API calls).
    *   Engineers features beyond simple metrics. Examples:
        *   *Rate of change* of metrics.
        *   *Co-occurrence* of categorical events (e.g., user X accessing application Y after error Z).
        *   *Temporal patterns* (e.g., peak load times for specific applications).
        *   *Session duration* and *frequency* based on user activity.

2.  **Behavioral Profile Builder:**
    *   Employs a hybrid modeling approach:
        *   **Statistical Modeling:** For numerical metrics, utilizes time-series forecasting (similar to the provided patent) to establish expected ranges.
        *   **Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs):** (Bayesian Networks or Markov Random Fields) to model relationships between categorical variables and events.  This captures dependencies like “high probability of error X occurring when user Y accesses application Z during peak hours.”
        *   **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA/t-SNE):** For reducing the complexity of the multi-dimensional feature space and identifying key behavioral dimensions.
    *   **Dynamic Profiling:**  The profile is *continuously updated* based on observed data, allowing it to adapt to changing system behavior and user patterns.  A “forgetting factor” can be incorporated to downweight older data and prioritize recent trends.

3.  **Anomaly Detection & Contextualization Engine:**
    *   **Deviation Scoring:** Calculates a deviation score for each observed data point based on its distance from the predicted value (for numerical metrics) or its probability under the PGM (for categorical data).
    *   **Contextualization:**  This is the key innovation.  Instead of simply flagging deviations, the engine:
        *   **Identifies relevant behavioral dimensions:**  Determines which dimensions of the behavioral profile are most affected by the anomaly.
        *   **Assesses the impact on critical functions:** Uses a predefined “critical function map” to determine which system functions are potentially impacted by the anomaly.
        *   **Assigns a severity score:**  Combines the deviation score, the impacted dimensions, and the criticality of the affected functions to generate an overall severity score.  This score drives alerting and response actions.

4.  **Automated Response Module:**
    *   Configurable rules for automated responses based on severity scores.  Examples:
        *   **Low Severity:** Log the anomaly for analysis.
        *   **Medium Severity:** Generate an alert and attempt self-remediation (e.g., restart a service, scale up resources).
        *   **High Severity:** Trigger a critical incident response workflow, notify on-call personnel, and initiate automated containment procedures.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Contextualization Engine):**

```pseudocode
function contextualize_anomaly(observation, behavioral_profile, critical_function_map):
  deviation_score = calculate_deviation_score(observation, behavioral_profile)

  impacted_dimensions = identify_impacted_dimensions(deviation_score, behavioral_profile)

  affected_functions = determine_affected_functions(impacted_dimensions, critical_function_map)

  severity_score = calculate_severity_score(deviation_score, affected_functions)

  anomaly_context = {
    "deviation_score": deviation_score,
    "impacted_dimensions": impacted_dimensions,
    "affected_functions": affected_functions,
    "severity_score": severity_score
  }

  return anomaly_context
```

**Critical Function Map Example:**

```json
{
  "dimension_A": {
    "function_X": "Critical",
    "function_Y": "Important",
    "function_Z": "Informational"
  },
  "dimension_B": {
    "function_P": "Important",
    "function_Q": "Informational"
  }
}
```

**Potential Advantages:**

*   **Reduced False Positives:** Contextualization helps filter out benign anomalies that don’t impact critical functions.
*   **Prioritized Response:** Severity scoring enables responders to focus on the most impactful issues first.
*   **Improved Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying impacted dimensions and affected functions provides valuable clues for diagnosing the underlying problem.
*   **Adaptive Security:** The system can learn and adapt to evolving threats and system behavior.
