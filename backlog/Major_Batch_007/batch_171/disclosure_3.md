## Adaptive Resource Prefetching via Client Signal Analysis

**Specification:** Implement a system that dynamically adjusts resource prefetching behavior based on real-time signal analysis derived from the client device. This extends beyond simple latency measurements to encompass a broader range of client-side data indicative of network conditions and user behavior.

**Components:**

*   **Client Signal Collector:** A lightweight client-side module collecting:
    *   **Network Signal Strength (RSSI/RSRP/RSRQ):** Indicative of overall network quality.
    *   **Network Type (5G, 4G, WiFi):** Allows for prioritization of resources based on connectivity.
    *   **Device Motion (Accelerometer/Gyroscope):** Detects device movement (e.g., in a vehicle) influencing network stability.
    *   **Battery Level:** Conserves battery by reducing prefetching when low.
    *   **CPU/Memory Usage:** Identifies resource constraints on the client.
    *   **App Foreground/Background Status:** Adapts prefetching based on app visibility.
*   **Signal Analysis Engine (Server-Side):** A server-side module that receives and analyzes client signals. Utilizes machine learning models to predict short-term network stability and user engagement.  Models trained on historical data correlating signals with successful/failed resource requests.
*   **Adaptive Prefetching Controller (Server-Side):**  Adjusts the number of resources prefetched based on the output of the Signal Analysis Engine.  Can dynamically modify:
    *   **Prefetch Depth:** The number of resources to prefetch.
    *   **Prefetch Priority:** Prioritizes resources critical for immediate use.
    *   **Prefetch Aggressiveness:**  Controls the frequency of prefetch requests.
*   **Resource Cache:**  Existing resource cache infrastructure, augmented to store prefetched resources and metadata (e.g., prefetch score, signal conditions at prefetch time).
*   **API Integration:**  Exposes an API for content providers to signal resource criticality (e.g., high-priority images for a specific section of an application).

**Workflow:**

1.  Client Signal Collector gathers data and transmits it to the Signal Analysis Engine.
2.  Signal Analysis Engine processes the data and generates a "prefetch score" reflecting network stability and user engagement probability.
3.  Adaptive Prefetching Controller receives the score and adjusts prefetching behavior accordingly.
4.  Resource Cache stores prefetched resources, utilizing the score to optimize cache eviction policies.
5.  Content providers can utilize the API to influence prefetch prioritization.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Prefetching Controller):**

```
function adjustPrefetch(prefetchScore, resourceCriticality):
  basePrefetchDepth = 2  // Default prefetch depth
  aggressionFactor = 1.0

  if (prefetchScore < 0.3):  // Poor network conditions
    aggressionFactor = 0.5
    basePrefetchDepth = 1
  elif (prefetchScore > 0.7):  // Excellent network conditions
    aggressionFactor = 1.5

  if (resourceCriticality == "high"):
    aggressionFactor *= 1.2

  finalPrefetchDepth = int(basePrefetchDepth * aggressionFactor)

  return finalPrefetchDepth
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond simple latency measurement to incorporate a more holistic view of client-side conditions. Enables truly *proactive* resource delivery, improving user experience in challenging network environments. Incorporates content provider input to prioritize critical resources. This is not just about faster loading, but about *anticipating* user needs and delivering resources before they are even requested, all while respecting client device limitations.
