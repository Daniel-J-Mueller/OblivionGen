## Adaptive Resource Allocation with Biofeedback Integration

**System Overview:** A distributed system augmenting voice-controlled resource scheduling with real-time biofeedback data from users. The goal is to dynamically optimize resource allocation (e.g., meeting rooms, quiet spaces) based on individual cognitive load and emotional state, creating environments conducive to peak performance and well-being.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Bio-Sensor Integration:** Wearable sensors (smartwatches, headbands, etc.) collect physiological data – heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), brainwave activity (EEG) – indicating user stress, focus, and cognitive load. This data is transmitted wirelessly to a central processing server.

2.  **Cognitive State Inference Engine:** A machine learning model analyzes the biofeedback data to infer the user’s cognitive and emotional state (e.g., “focused,” “stressed,” “distracted,” “fatigued”). The engine outputs a 'cognitive profile' representing the user's current state.

3.  **Dynamic Resource Mapping:** A database maps resource characteristics (room size, lighting, noise level, available equipment) to cognitive profiles. For example, a quiet room with dim lighting might be mapped to a "stressed" or "fatigued" profile.

4.  **Voice Control Interface:** The existing voice control system is extended to incorporate biofeedback-driven scheduling requests.  Users can issue commands such as:
    *   "Find me a space to focus." (System infers a need for a quiet, distraction-free environment.)
    *   "I'm feeling overwhelmed, find me a calming space." (System prioritizes quiet rooms with soft lighting and nature sounds.)
    *   “Schedule a collaboration space where my team can brainstorm.” (System infers a need for an interactive and open room).

5. **Proactive Resource Suggestion:**  The system continuously monitors biofeedback data and proactively suggests resources based on inferred needs.  For instance, if a user's stress levels rise during a meeting, the system might suggest a short break in a calming space. 

**Pseudocode (Scheduling Logic):**

```
FUNCTION ScheduleResource(userID, intent, metadata)

    // 1. Get User's Cognitive Profile (from Biofeedback Data)
    cognitiveProfile = GetCognitiveProfile(userID)

    // 2. Get Resource Requirements (from Intent & Metadata)
    resourceRequirements = DetermineResourceRequirements(intent, metadata)

    // 3. Filter Available Resources
    availableResources = GetAvailableResources()
    filteredResources = FilterResources(availableResources, cognitiveProfile, resourceRequirements)

    // 4. Rank Filtered Resources (based on a 'suitability score')
    scoredResources = RankResources(filteredResources, cognitiveProfile)

    // 5. Select Best Resource
    bestResource = SelectResource(scoredResources)

    // 6. Schedule Resource & Update Calendar
    ScheduleResourceAndCalendar(bestResource, userID)

    // 7. Send Confirmation (Voice & Visual)
    SendConfirmation(userID, bestResource)

END FUNCTION
```
