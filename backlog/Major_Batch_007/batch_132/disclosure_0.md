## Dynamic Avatar Persona Construction

**Concept:** Expand avatar emotional expression beyond immediate message reaction, constructing a persistent “persona” influenced by user communication patterns.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Persona Database:** Maintain a database of weighted emotional attributes for each user’s avatar. Attributes include (but are not limited to): Optimism, Pessimism, Sarcasm, Enthusiasm, Calmness, Irritability, Playfulness, Seriousness. Initial weights are randomly assigned within a defined range.

2.  **Communication Analysis Engine:** This engine processes incoming and outgoing messages (text, voice, potentially video) in real-time.  Key features extracted include:
    *   **Sentiment Score:** Standard sentiment analysis to gauge positive/negative tone.
    *   **Keyword Density:** Identify frequency of emotionally-charged keywords (e.g., “amazing,” “terrible,” “frustrating”).
    *   **Punctuation Analysis:** Count frequency of exclamation points, question marks, ellipses, etc.
    *   **Emoticon/Emoji Usage:** Categorize and count usage of different emoticons/emojis.
    *   **Linguistic Style:**  Analyze sentence length, complexity, and use of slang/formal language.

3.  **Persona Update Algorithm:** This algorithm adjusts the avatar's emotional attribute weights based on the Communication Analysis Engine’s output.  
    *   **Weight Adjustment:**  For example, repeated use of positive sentiment and exclamation points increases the "Optimism" and "Enthusiasm" weights.  Frequent use of negative keywords and question marks increases “Pessimism” and “Irritability”.
    *   **Decay Factor:** Implement a decay factor to gradually reduce the influence of past communications, preventing the persona from becoming overly rigid.
    *   **Thresholding:** Prevent weights from exceeding predefined maximum/minimum values.

4.  **Animation Mapping:**  Map the avatar's emotional attribute weights to a set of predefined animation parameters. 
    *   **Facial Expressions:**  Adjust facial muscle movements to reflect the dominant emotional attributes (e.g., raised eyebrows for surprise, furrowed brow for frustration).
    *   **Body Language:** Modify posture, gestures, and movement speed to convey the avatar’s personality.  Enthusiastic avatars might have more frequent and exaggerated gestures.
    *   **Voice Modulation:**  (If voice output is available) Modify pitch, tone, and speaking rate based on the emotional attributes.

5.  **Dynamic Animation Blend:** Blend the persona-driven animations with the immediate message-reaction animations (laughing, clapping, etc.). The persona should subtly influence the *style* of the immediate reactions. For example, a sarcastic avatar might deliver a laughing animation with a slightly exaggerated, mocking tone.

**Pseudocode (Persona Update):**

```
function updatePersona(messageData, currentPersona):
  sentimentScore = analyzeSentiment(messageData.text)
  keywordDensity = analyzeKeywords(messageData.text)
  punctuationScore = analyzePunctuation(messageData.text)
  emoticonScore = analyzeEmoticons(messageData.emoticons)

  //Weight adjustments based on analysis
  currentPersona.optimism += sentimentScore * 0.1
  currentPersona.sarcasm += (1 - sentimentScore) * 0.05
  currentPersona.enthusiasm += keywordDensity["positive"] * 0.1
  currentPersona.irritability += keywordDensity["negative"] * 0.1
  currentPersona.playfulness += emoticonScore["playful"] * 0.1

  // Decay factor
  for each attribute in currentPersona:
    attribute *= 0.99  //Gradually reduce influence of past communications

  //Thresholding
  for each attribute in currentPersona:
    attribute = clamp(attribute, 0, 1) //Limit values between 0 and 1

  return currentPersona
```

**Technical Considerations:**

*   Requires a robust natural language processing (NLP) engine.
*   Animation blending algorithms need to be carefully tuned to avoid jarring transitions.
*   Data privacy must be considered when storing and analyzing user communication data.
*   Computational cost of NLP and animation blending needs to be optimized for real-time performance.
