## Secure Account 'Ghosting' & Dynamic Permissioning

**Concept:** Extend the shared account access paradigm to create 'ghost' accounts – temporary, limited-access instances of a user’s primary account – coupled with dynamic permissioning based on real-time context and user behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Ghost Account Creation:**

*   **Trigger:** User initiates 'Ghost Account' creation from primary account settings.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   *Duration:* Defines the lifespan of the ghost account (e.g., 1 hour, until explicitly revoked).
    *   *Scope:* Specifies which network sites/services the ghost account applies to. (e.g., only social media, only financial services).
    *   *Permission Profile:* Selects from pre-defined or custom permission levels (see section 2).
    *   *Contextual Triggers:* (Optional) Defines conditions under which the ghost account is automatically activated/deactivated (e.g., location-based, time-based, device-based).
*   **Mechanism:** Upon creation, a temporary credential set is generated. This set *does not* replicate the primary account password. It is a unique, time-limited token. 

**2. Dynamic Permission Profiles:**

*   **Pre-defined Profiles:**
    *   *View Only:* Ghost account can only view information. No actions permitted.
    *   *Limited Interaction:* Allows posting/commenting but restricts financial transactions or profile modifications.
    *   *Delegated Task:* Allows specific, pre-approved actions (e.g., respond to messages, approve content).
*   **Custom Profiles:** Users can create granular permission sets, specifying allowed actions for each service/site.
*   **Behavioral Adaptation:** System monitors ghost account activity. If suspicious behavior is detected (e.g., unusual access patterns, attempts to bypass restrictions), permissions are automatically downgraded or the account is suspended.

**3. Secure Transfer & Revocation:**

*   **Encrypted Tunnel:** When sharing with another user, the ghost account credentials are transferred via an end-to-end encrypted tunnel.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication:** The receiving user must authenticate using multi-factor authentication before accessing the ghost account.
*   **Automatic Revocation:** Ghost account automatically revokes at the end of its lifespan.  The primary account owner can also manually revoke at any time.
*   **Audit Logging:** All ghost account activity is logged for security and compliance purposes.

**4. Pseudocode (Ghost Account Activation):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION ActivateGhostAccount(primaryUserID, sharedUserID, serviceID, ghostAccountData)
  // ghostAccountData contains: duration, scope, permissionProfile, etc.

  // 1. Verify ghostAccountData integrity and expiration.
  IF ghostAccountData.IsExpired() OR ghostAccountData.IsTampered() THEN
    RETURN ERROR: "Invalid Ghost Account Data"
  ENDIF

  // 2. Authenticate sharedUserID using MFA.
  IF NOT AuthenticateUser(sharedUserID, MFA_Method) THEN
    RETURN ERROR: "Authentication Failed"
  ENDIF

  // 3. Create temporary credential set (token) for sharedUserID.
  token = GenerateTemporaryToken(sharedUserID, serviceID, ghostAccountData.permissionProfile)

  // 4. Establish secure tunnel for token transfer.
  SecureTunnel = CreateSecureTunnel(primaryUserID, sharedUserID)
  TransferToken(SecureTunnel, token)

  // 5. Log activation event.
  LogEvent("Ghost Account Activated", primaryUserID, sharedUserID, serviceID)

  RETURN SUCCESS

END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Secure Remote Support:** IT professionals can access user accounts temporarily to provide support without requiring full credentials.
*   **Collaboration with Freelancers:** Share limited access to accounts for specific tasks.
*   **Temporary Delegation:** Allow trusted individuals to manage accounts during absences.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Reduce the risk of credential theft and unauthorized access.
