## Adaptive Quorum via Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the replica group management by incorporating predictive modeling of node failure and network latency. Instead of relying solely on a fixed failover quorum size, dynamically adjust the quorum based on real-time predictions of node availability. This aims to minimize both false positives (unnecessary failovers) and false negatives (prolonged unavailability) by preemptively weighting 'healthier' nodes in the quorum.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Node Health Score:** Each node maintains a ‘Health Score’ calculated continuously. This score combines:
    *   **Historical Uptime:** Percentage of time node has been operational over a rolling window (e.g., last 7 days).
    *   **Network Latency:** Average round-trip time (RTT) to other nodes in the group.
    *   **Resource Utilization:** CPU, memory, and disk I/O load.
    *   **Predictive Failure Probability:** Derived from a machine learning model (see section 2).

2.  **Predictive Failure Model:**
    *   **Data Sources:** System logs, performance metrics, historical failure data.
    *   **Model Type:** Time series forecasting (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) or a classification model trained on failure patterns.
    *   **Output:** Probability of failure within a defined timeframe (e.g., next hour, next 24 hours).
    *   **Continuous Retraining:** Model is retrained regularly with new data to adapt to changing system conditions.

3.  **Dynamic Quorum Adjustment:**
    *   **Weighted Voting:** During quorum calculation, each node’s ‘vote’ is weighted by its Health Score. Nodes with higher scores have more influence.
    *   **Quorum Threshold:** The quorum threshold is calculated dynamically based on the weighted sum of Health Scores of all nodes.
    *   **Formula:** `Quorum Threshold = Total Weighted Health Score * Sensitivity Factor`
        *   `Sensitivity Factor`: Adjustable parameter to control the responsiveness of the quorum adjustment. Lower values prioritize availability, higher values prioritize consistency.
    *   **Example:** If node A has a Health Score of 0.9, node B has 0.7, and node C has 0.5, the weighted sum is (0.9 + 0.7 + 0.5) = 2.1. A sensitivity factor of 0.5 would yield a quorum threshold of 1.05. Meaning at least 1.05 weighted 'votes' are required for a decision.

4.  **Failure Prediction Trigger:** If the predictive model flags a node with a high probability of failure, its weight in the quorum is temporarily reduced or even removed until the failure is confirmed or the prediction is invalidated.

5.  **Implementation Pseudocode (Quorum Calculation):**

```pseudocode
function calculateQuorum(replicaGroup, sensitivityFactor):
  totalWeightedHealthScore = 0
  for each replica in replicaGroup:
    healthScore = replica.getHealthScore()
    totalWeightedHealthScore += healthScore

  quorumThreshold = totalWeightedHealthScore * sensitivityFactor
  return quorumThreshold

function determineMaster(replicaGroup, quorumThreshold):
  master = null
  highestVote = 0
  for each replica in replicaGroup:
    vote = replica.getHealthScore() //using health score as a vote
    if vote > highestVote:
      highestVote = vote
      master = replica

  if highestVote >= quorumThreshold:
    return master
  else:
    return null // No master can be determined
```

6.  **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor the Health Scores, quorum thresholds, and master selection process. Generate alerts when:
    *   Health Scores fall below a predefined threshold.
    *   The quorum threshold is unstable or fluctuates significantly.
    *   Master selection fails due to an inability to reach the quorum.
