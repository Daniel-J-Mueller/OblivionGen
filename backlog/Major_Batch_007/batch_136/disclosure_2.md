## Dynamic Data Provenance & Reputation System

**Concept:** Extend the existing security tagging system to incorporate data *provenance* and *reputation* scoring. Instead of just tagging data with security levels, track the entire lifecycle of the data – who created it, what transformations it underwent, and who accessed it. Assign a reputation score to both the data *and* the entities interacting with it.

**Specs:**

**1. Provenance Tracking Module:**

*   **Data Structure:**  Provenance records will be structured as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
    *   Nodes: Represent data objects (files, database records, API responses).
    *   Edges: Represent transformations or accesses performed on the data.  Edge attributes include:
        *   Entity performing the action (user ID, application ID, service ID).
        *   Timestamp.
        *   Type of action (read, write, transform, transmit).
        *   Transformation details (if applicable – e.g., specific algorithm used, parameters applied).
*   **Integration with Virtual Machine Manager:** The VMM intercepts all data accesses and modifications.  For each interaction:
    1.  Create a new provenance node representing the affected data object (if it doesn't exist).
    2.  Create a new provenance edge connecting the interacting entity to the data object, with appropriate attributes.
    3.  Store provenance data in a dedicated, tamper-proof database (e.g., blockchain-inspired).
*   **API:** A dedicated API allows querying the provenance graph.
    *   `getProvenance(dataObjectId)`: Returns the entire provenance graph for a specific data object.
    *   `getEntitiesAccessedData(dataObjectId)`: Returns a list of entities that have accessed a data object.
    *   `getTransformations(dataObjectId)`: Returns a list of transformations applied to a data object.

**2. Reputation Scoring Module:**

*   **Entity Reputation:** Each entity (user, application, service) has a reputation score.  Initial score is neutral (e.g., 500).
*   **Data Reputation:** Each data object has a reputation score. Initial score is neutral.
*   **Scoring Factors:** Reputation scores are updated based on the following:
    *   **Positive Signals:** Data creation by trusted entities, successful data transformations, data accessed only by authorized entities.
    *   **Negative Signals:** Unauthorized access, malicious transformations, data exposure, data linked to known threats.
    *   **Weighting:** Different signals have different weights. For example, a confirmed data breach has a much higher negative weight than a simple unauthorized access attempt.
*   **Reputation Calculation:** A decay function is applied to reputation scores to account for the passage of time.  The decay rate is configurable.
*   **Integration with VMM:** The VMM uses reputation scores to make access control decisions.
    *   Higher reputation scores grant more access.
    *   Lower reputation scores trigger stricter security checks or block access entirely.
    *   Access requests from entities with low reputation scores trigger alerts.

**3. Policy Engine Integration:**

*   Policies can be defined based on both security levels *and* reputation scores.  Example: "Allow access to sensitive data only if the user has a reputation score above 700 and the data has a reputation score above 600."
*   Dynamic Policy Adjustment:  The system automatically adjusts policies based on real-time reputation scores.

**Pseudocode (VMM Access Control Logic):**

```
function checkAccess(user, data):
  userRep = getReputation(user)
  dataRep = getReputation(data)
  securityLevel = getDataSecurityLevel(data)

  if (securityLevel > user.clearance):
    return false // Access denied

  // Check Reputation-based access control
  if (userRep < 200):
      log("Low reputation user attempting access")
      return false

  if (dataRep < 300):
      log("Low reputation data access attempt")
      // Require additional verification step

  return true // Access granted
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simple security tagging by incorporating a dynamic reputation component. This enables more nuanced access control decisions, adapts to changing threat landscapes, and builds trust in data provenance. It adds a feedback loop to the security tagging, and integrates data integrity/trust to the system.
