## Dynamic Neural Network ‘Self-Calibration’ via Adversarial Perturbation

**Concept:** Leverage adversarial perturbation techniques *during* inference to dynamically calibrate a neural network’s internal representations and detect/mitigate improper input *before* it manifests as an outlier in layer outputs. This shifts from post-hoc outlier detection to *proactive* input validation.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires minor additions to existing neural network processor architecture. Primarily additional low-latency arithmetic units and a small, dedicated memory buffer.
*   **Software:** Kernel-level integration within the NN processor’s inference engine. Requires a configurable perturbation profile.

**Detailed Design:**

1.  **Perturbation Profile:** Define a set of small, structured perturbations (e.g., adding/subtracting a small fraction of the standard deviation to/from input features). The profile is configurable and application-specific.  Different profiles could be designed for different input types or expected anomalies.
2.  **Perturbation Application:** For *each* input sample, apply a randomly selected perturbation from the defined profile.  The randomness adds robustness and prevents ‘gaming’ the system.
3.  **Parallel Inference:**  Run the inference process *twice* in parallel:
    *   **Nominal Path:** Standard inference with the original input.
    *   **Perturbed Path:** Inference with the perturbed input.
4.  **Representation Divergence Metric:**  Calculate a “divergence” metric between the activations (outputs) of *multiple* layers in the nominal and perturbed paths.  This could be:
    *   **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Between activation vectors.
    *   **Cosine Similarity:**  Measuring the angle between activation vectors.
    *   **KL Divergence:**  Treating activations as probability distributions.
5.  **Divergence Threshold:** Establish a dynamic threshold for the divergence metric.  This threshold isn’t fixed; it’s learned during a calibration phase using a representative dataset of ‘good’ inputs.  The threshold should represent the level of divergence expected for legitimate inputs.
6.  **Improper Input Determination:** If the calculated divergence exceeds the threshold, the input is flagged as improper.
7.  **Mitigation/Action:**
    *   **Notification:**  Alert the application.
    *   **Input Rejection:**  Discard the input.
    *   **Adaptive Filtering:**  Apply a pre-defined filtering strategy to the input.
    *   **Dynamic Profile Adjustment:**  If a pattern of improper inputs is detected, automatically adjust the perturbation profile to improve detection accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Key Section):**

```python
function detect_improper_input(input_data, perturbation_profile, divergence_threshold):

  perturbed_input = apply_perturbation(input_data, perturbation_profile)

  nominal_activations = run_inference(input_data)
  perturbed_activations = run_inference(perturbed_input)

  divergence = calculate_divergence(nominal_activations, perturbed_activations)

  if divergence > divergence_threshold:
    return "Improper Input Detected"
  else:
    return "Input Valid"
```

**Hardware Implications:**

*   **Dual Inference Engines:** The primary challenge is performing two inference runs in parallel without significantly impacting latency. This requires either dedicated hardware resources or highly optimized scheduling.
*   **Low-Latency Memory:**  Fast access to activations is critical for calculating the divergence metric.  A small, dedicated buffer is recommended.

**Novelty:**  This approach moves beyond detecting outliers in outputs and focuses on identifying anomalies in *internal representations* by actively probing the network's sensitivity to small perturbations. It offers a more proactive and potentially more robust solution for improper input handling.
