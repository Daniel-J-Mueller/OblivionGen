## Dynamic Profile Stitching with Temporal Anchors

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical data association to incorporate a temporal dimension, allowing for reconstruction of a profile's state at any given point in time. This isn't just about *what* data is associated with a profile, but *when* that association was active. This allows for historical analysis, targeted marketing based on past behaviors, and accurate record-keeping for compliance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Temporal Anchor Data Structure:**

   *   **AnchorID:** Unique identifier for a temporal snapshot. Generated automatically.
   *   **ProfileID:**  Identifier of the associated profile.
   *   **Timestamp:**  Date and time the anchor represents (start of the temporal window).
   *   **DataObjectList:**  List of standardized data objects active at this timestamp. Each entry includes:
        *   **DataObjectIdentifier:**  Unique identifier for the standardized data object.
        *   **DataObjectVersion:**  Version number of the standardized data object. Crucial for tracking changes.
        *   **ActivationTimestamp:**  Timestamp when this object became active *within* this anchor.
        *   **DeactivationTimestamp:** Timestamp when this object became inactive *within* this anchor.  If null, object is still active.
   *   **Metadata:**  Optional metadata regarding the anchor itself (e.g., data source, processing status).

**2. Modified Object Mapping:**

   *   Object mappings must now include a “TemporalSensitivity” flag.
        *   **True:** The object is sensitive to time and requires temporal anchoring.
        *   **False:**  The object is considered static and not subject to temporal anchoring.
   *   Mapping must also define a “DefaultTemporalRange” – a default duration for object activity if deactivation is not explicitly specified.

**3. Indexing Modifications:**

   *   Introduce a "Temporal Index". This index is built on AnchorIDs and allows for fast retrieval of profile states at specific times.
   *   Primary Profile Index needs modification to include a pointer to the Temporal Index.

**4. Workflow:**

1.  **Data Object Ingestion:** When a data object is ingested:
    *   Determine TemporalSensitivity.
    *   If True, create a new Temporal Anchor *or* append to the existing anchor if within a defined "AnchorWindow" (e.g., last 24 hours).  If outside the AnchorWindow, create a new Anchor.
    *   Record ActivationTimestamp and initial DeactivationTimestamp (initially null).
2.  **Data Object Updates:** When a data object is updated:
    *   Update the existing Temporal Anchor entry.
    *   Record the updated DeactivationTimestamp for the previous version.
    *   Create a new entry with the new version, updated ActivationTimestamp, and a new DeactivationTimestamp (initially null).
3.  **Data Object Deletion:** When a data object is deleted:
    *   Update the current Temporal Anchor entry with the current timestamp as the DeactivationTimestamp.
4.  **Profile State Retrieval:**
    *   Given a ProfileID and Timestamp:
        *   Query the Temporal Index for the AnchorID covering the requested Timestamp.
        *   Retrieve the associated DataObjectList from that AnchorID. This provides a snapshot of the profile at that time.

**Pseudocode (Profile State Retrieval):**

```
function getProfileState(profileID, requestedTimestamp):
  anchorID = temporalIndex.findAnchorID(profileID, requestedTimestamp)
  if anchorID == null:
    // No data for this timestamp, return empty profile
    return emptyProfile

  anchor = temporalIndex.getAnchor(anchorID)
  dataObjectList = anchor.getDataObjectList()

  // Filter data objects to only include those active at the requested timestamp
  activeDataObjects = []
  for dataObject in dataObjectList:
    if dataObject.activationTimestamp <= requestedTimestamp and (dataObject.deactivationTimestamp == null or dataObject.deactivationTimestamp >= requestedTimestamp):
      activeDataObjects.add(dataObject)

  // Construct profile state from active data objects
  profileState = constructProfileState(activeDataObjects)
  return profileState
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Integrate with CDC systems to automatically create and update Temporal Anchors based on changes in source data.
*   **Data Lineage Tracking:** Extend Temporal Anchors to track the source and transformation history of each data object.
*   **Predictive Modeling:**  Use historical profile states to train predictive models for future behavior.
*   **Compliance Auditing:** Provide a complete audit trail of all profile data changes over time for regulatory compliance.
