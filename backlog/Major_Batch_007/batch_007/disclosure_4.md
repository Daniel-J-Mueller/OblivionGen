## Schema-Aware Data Sharding with Dynamic Consistency Levels

**Concept:** Extend the schema versioning system to enable intelligent data sharding across storage nodes *based on schema version* and introduce dynamic consistency levels determined by the accessing client’s schema version. This allows for seamless evolution of hierarchical data structures while optimizing read/write performance and ensuring data integrity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Schema Version Mapping to Shards:**

*   Each schema version is associated with a set of "shards" (storage node groupings).
*   When a hierarchical data structure is created (or initially migrated), its associated schema version dictates the initial shard assignment.
*   New schema versions can define *new* shards, effectively creating new data partitions.
*   Existing schema versions maintain mappings to existing shards.
*   Schema version to shard mapping is stored in a dedicated metadata service (separate from the data itself).

**2. Dynamic Consistency Levels:**

*   Clients specify their *expected* schema version in each request.
*   The system determines the “compatibility range” between the client’s expected schema version and the *actual* schema version of the data being accessed.
*   Based on the compatibility range, a *dynamic consistency level* is assigned to the request.
    *   **Full Compatibility:** Client and data schema versions match. Highest consistency (e.g., strong consistency, read-after-write).
    *   **Backward Compatibility:** Client schema version is older than data schema version.  Data schema changes are handled (e.g., new attributes are returned with null values, missing attributes for the client are synthesized). Moderate consistency (e.g., eventual consistency with conflict resolution).
    *   **Forward Compatibility (Limited):** Client schema version is newer than data schema version. The system attempts to "downcast" the data to the client's expected schema. Lower consistency (e.g., eventual consistency with potential data loss). Requires careful design to prevent data corruption.
    *   **Incompatible:** Client and data schema versions are too different. Request fails or is routed to an error handler.

**3. Data Migration Strategy:**

*   When a new schema version is deployed, data migration happens *in the background*.
*   Migration strategy is defined per attribute:
    *   **Copy:** Attribute values are copied to the new schema.
    *   **Transform:** Attribute values are transformed (e.g., data type conversion, unit conversion).
    *   **Synthesize:** Attribute values are synthesized (e.g., calculated from other attributes).
    *   **Drop:** Attribute is removed (only applicable during schema rollback).
*   Migration is performed on a per-shard basis, minimizing disruption.
*   A “migration progress” indicator is maintained for each shard.

**4.  Pseudocode (Read Request):**

```
function readData(clientId, objectId, expectedSchemaVersion) {

  shardId = getShardForObject(objectId)
  actualSchemaVersion = getActualSchemaVersionForObject(objectId)

  compatibilityRange = calculateCompatibility(expectedSchemaVersion, actualSchemaVersion)
  consistencyLevel = determineConsistencyLevel(compatibilityRange)

  if (consistencyLevel == "Incompatible") {
    throw Error("Schema Incompatibility")
  }

  data = readDataFromShard(shardId, objectId, consistencyLevel)

  //Handle schema differences (downcasting or synthesis) if needed

  return data
}
```

**5.  Metadata Service Schema (simplified):**

```
SchemaVersion: {
  versionId: Integer,
  schemaDefinition: String,
  shardMappings: [ShardId],
  migrationProgress: [ShardId: Float] // Progress from 0.0 to 1.0 per shard
}

ObjectMetadata: {
  objectId: String,
  schemaVersionId: Integer,
  shardId: Integer
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved scalability through data sharding.
*   Reduced read/write latency by optimizing consistency levels.
*   Seamless schema evolution without downtime.
*   Support for diverse client applications with different schema versions.
*   Better resource utilization through optimized data access.
