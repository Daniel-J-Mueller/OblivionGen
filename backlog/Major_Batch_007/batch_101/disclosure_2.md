**Automated Codebase ‘Health’ Visualization & Predictive Refactoring**

**Concept:** Expand the idea of identifying rule violations to create a dynamic, interactive visualization of an entire codebase’s ‘health’. Beyond just flagging violations, the system predicts potential future issues based on code complexity, violation density, and historical refactoring patterns. This extends to suggesting automated refactoring pathways.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** ‘Code Health Engine’ – a module integrated into the existing system, operating on a codebase repository (Git, SVN, etc.).
*   **Data Gathering:**
    *   Static Analysis: Leverage the recurrent neural network language model for identifying rule violations (as in the existing patent).
    *   Code Complexity Metrics: Integrate tools to calculate cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity, and lines of code per function/class.
    *   Historical Data: Track code commits, refactoring events, bug fixes, and code churn over time.
    *   Dependency Analysis: Map code dependencies to identify potential ripple effects of changes.
*   **Visualization Layer:**
    *   Interactive Code Map: A visual representation of the codebase, where code modules are nodes and dependencies are edges. Node color/size represent ‘health’ scores.
    *   Heatmaps: Display violation density across modules, functions, or lines of code.
    *   Trend Graphs: Show historical ‘health’ metrics (violations, complexity) over time.
    *   Drill-Down Capabilities: Allow users to explore specific modules and violations in detail.
*   **Predictive Modeling:**
    *   Machine Learning Models: Train models to predict future violations or code smells based on historical data and current code characteristics.
    *   Risk Scoring: Assign risk scores to modules based on predictive models.
*   **Automated Refactoring Suggestions:**
    *   Refactoring Pathways: Identify potential refactoring strategies based on code characteristics and risk scores.
    *   Automated Refactoring Tools: Integrate tools to automatically apply refactoring strategies (e.g., extract method, inline method, rename variable).
    *   Cost/Benefit Analysis: Estimate the cost and benefit of applying different refactoring strategies.

**Pseudocode (Refactoring Suggestion Algorithm):**

```
function suggest_refactoring(module):
  risk_score = calculate_risk_score(module)
  if risk_score > threshold:
    refactoring_options = identify_refactoring_options(module)
    for option in refactoring_options:
      cost = estimate_cost(option)
      benefit = estimate_benefit(option)
      if benefit > cost:
        suggest_refactoring(option)
  return
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance server with sufficient memory and storage.
*   Code repository access.
*   Integration with existing static analysis tools and refactoring tools.
*   User interface (web-based or desktop application).
*   Database to store historical data and metrics.
*   Machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
