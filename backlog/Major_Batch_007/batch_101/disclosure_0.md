## Adaptive Content Stitching with Predictive Pre-fetch

**Concept:** Extend the content source ranking system to proactively stitch together content segments from multiple sources *before* playback degradation occurs, creating a seamless, higher-quality stream. This moves beyond reactive switching to predictive, pre-emptive optimization.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** "Pre-Stitch Engine" – integrated into the existing merchant system.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time quality metrics (as per existing patent).
    *   Client bandwidth estimates.
    *   Content segmentation information (manifest files - HLS, DASH, etc.).
    *   Historical segment performance data (buffering, resolution switches).
    *   Latency metrics between client and content sources.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Segment Prediction:** For upcoming content segments, the Pre-Stitch Engine forecasts expected quality from each ranked content source based on historical data, current metrics, and client bandwidth.
    2.  **Quality-Weighted Stitching:**  A weighted scoring system combines predicted quality, latency, and cost (if applicable) for each source’s segment.  The highest-scoring segments are selected.
    3.  **Pre-Fetch & Assembly:**  The selected segments are pre-fetched and assembled *before* the current segment finishes playing.  This creates a “pre-stitched” segment ready for playback.
    4.  **Seamless Transition:** The client seamlessly transitions to the pre-stitched segment as the current segment ends.
    5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The algorithm continuously monitors performance and adjusts stitching strategies in real-time. Segments can be dropped or substituted mid-stream if necessary.
*   **Client-Side Implementation:**
    *   Modified player to accept pre-stitched segments.
    *   Buffering mechanism adjusted to account for pre-fetched content.
    *   Reporting of segment quality and transition smoothness to the merchant system.
*   **Pseudocode (Pre-Stitch Engine):**

```
function pre_stitch(client_id, content_id, upcoming_segment_index):
  available_sources = get_ranked_sources(client_id, content_id)
  segment_predictions = {}

  for source in available_sources:
    predicted_quality = predict_segment_quality(source, upcoming_segment_index)
    latency = get_latency(client_id, source)
    segment_predictions[source] = predicted_quality * (1 / latency)

  best_source = max(segment_predictions, key=segment_predictions.get)

  fetch_segment(best_source, upcoming_segment_index)
  assemble_stitched_segment()
  return stitched_segment
```

*   **Scalability:** The merchant system needs to handle a significant increase in pre-fetch requests. Distributed caching and CDN integration will be crucial.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is required to deal with failed pre-fetches or corrupted segments.  Fallbacks to standard source switching should be implemented.
*   **Potential Benefits:** Reduced buffering, improved video quality, enhanced user experience, and potential for adaptive bitrate optimization beyond simple switching.
