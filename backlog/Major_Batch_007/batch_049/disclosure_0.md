## Dynamic Interest Mapping via Temporal Foot Traffic Prediction

**Concept:** Expand the concept of discovering public points of interest (POIs) by not just identifying *where* people go, but *when* they are likely to be there, and dynamically weighting POI significance based on predicted foot traffic. This moves beyond static POI identification to a predictive, real-time interest map.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Sources:** Combines data from the original patent (user submissions, check-ins) with real-time data feeds:
    *   Social media activity (geo-tagged posts, event announcements).
    *   Public transportation schedules & ridership data.
    *   Weather data.
    *   Event ticketing platforms.
    *   News feeds relating to local events (concerts, protests, etc.).
*   **Data Format:** All data normalized into a unified time-stamped geo-location format.

**2. Temporal Foot Traffic Prediction Engine:**

*   **Algorithm:** Employ a hybrid time series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM Recurrent Neural Network combined with ARIMA) trained on historical and real-time data.
*   **Variables:** Model input includes:
    *   Historical foot traffic data for the POI.
    *   Day of week, time of day, season.
    *   Weather conditions.
    *   Event schedules.
    *   Social media sentiment analysis related to the POI.
*   **Output:** Predicts the expected number of visitors to a POI for each 15-minute interval over the next 24 hours.  Provides a confidence interval for the prediction.

**3. Dynamic POI Weighting System:**

*   **Weight Calculation:** Assigns a dynamic weight to each POI based on:
    *   Predicted foot traffic (higher traffic = higher weight).
    *   Confidence interval of the prediction (lower uncertainty = higher weight).
    *   User engagement metrics (number of check-ins, positive reviews).
    *   POI category (e.g., emergency services receive a baseline higher weight).
*   **Weight Decay:** Implement a decay function to reduce the weight of POIs with consistently low predicted traffic. This prevents stale POIs from dominating the map.

**4. Real-time Interest Map Renderer:**

*   **Visualization:** Display a dynamic map with POIs represented by markers.
*   **Marker Size/Color:**  Marker size and color indicate the POI's current weight.  Brighter and larger markers represent higher interest.
*   **Time Slider:** Allow users to scrub through a time slider to see predicted interest levels at different times of day.
*   **Filtering:** Enable users to filter POIs by category (e.g., restaurants, museums, parks).
*   **Alerts:** Provide proactive alerts for sudden increases in predicted traffic at specific POIs (e.g., "High traffic expected at Central Park in 30 minutes").

**5. Feedback Loop & Model Retraining:**

*   **Real-time Data Collection:** Continuously collect actual foot traffic data using location services (with user consent).
*   **Model Comparison:** Compare predicted traffic with actual traffic.
*   **Model Retraining:** Automatically retrain the Temporal Foot Traffic Prediction Engine using the new data to improve accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
For Each Time Interval (e.g., 15 minutes)
    // Predict Foot Traffic for Each POI
    predictedTraffic = PredictTraffic(POI, currentTime, historicalData, weatherData, eventData)

    // Calculate Dynamic Weight
    weight = CalculateWeight(predictedTraffic, confidenceInterval, userEngagement)

    // Update Map Visualization
    UpdateMap(POI, weight)
End For

// Periodic Retraining
Every 24 Hours
    RetrainModel(newFootTrafficData)
End Periodic
```
