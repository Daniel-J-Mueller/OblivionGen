## Adaptive Environmental Storytelling System

**Core Concept:** Expand threat level notification beyond simple alerts into a dynamic environmental storytelling system, leveraging the A/V device’s awareness to subtly influence the environment and create a sense of unease or security proportional to the detected threat. This moves beyond simply *telling* the user there’s a threat to *showing* them.

**System Components:**

*   **A/V Device (extended):** Existing camera and processing capabilities, plus control over connected ‘smart’ environmental devices (lights, speakers, smart blinds, scent diffusers).
*   **Threat Level Mapping:**  A refined threat level system.  Instead of broad levels (low, medium, high), granular levels (1-10) are implemented.  This allows for nuanced environmental responses.
*   **Environmental Response Library:** A database of pre-defined “scenes” or environmental responses linked to threat levels. Examples:
    *   **Level 1-3 (Low):**  Subtle warm lighting increase, calming ambient music, gentle scent diffusion (lavender/vanilla). A "safe" atmosphere.
    *   **Level 4-6 (Medium):**  Cooler lighting tones, subtle increase in ambient sound (distant traffic/city noise), very faint, neutral scent. Creates a sense of awareness.
    *   **Level 7-9 (High):**  Dimming lights with flickering effect, directional sound cues mimicking approaching footsteps, introduction of a slightly unsettling scent (ozone/metallic).  Raises alertness.
    *   **Level 10 (Critical):** Rapid flashing of lights (red/orange), loud alarm sound, introduction of a strong, unpleasant scent (burnt rubber/smoke). Panic response.
*   **Learning Module:**  The system learns user preferences for environmental responses. If a user consistently overrides a specific response, the system adapts and suggests alternatives.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  threatLevel = getThreatLevelFromAVDevice();

  // Apply Environmental Response
  if (threatLevel > 0) {
    scene = selectScene(threatLevel);
    applyScene(scene);
  } else {
    resetEnvironment(); // Return to default settings
  }

  delay(1); // Check every 1 second
}

// Function: selectScene(threatLevel)
function selectScene(threatLevel) {
  // Lookup scene based on threatLevel.
  // Access Environmental Response Library.

  // Adaptive Learning:
  if (userOverride[threatLevel]) {
    // Select user-preferred scene.
    return userPreferredScene[threatLevel];
  }

  return defaultScene[threatLevel];
}

// Function: applyScene(scene)
function applyScene(scene) {
  // Control Smart Devices:
  setLights(scene.lightColor, scene.lightIntensity, scene.lightFlicker);
  setSound(scene.soundProfile, scene.soundVolume);
  setScent(scene.scentProfile, scene.scentIntensity);
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Compatible smart lighting system (Hue, Lifx, etc.).
*   Smart speaker system with multi-room audio capabilities.
*   Scent diffuser compatible with automation systems.
*   A/V device with control APIs for smart devices.



**Refinement Notes:**

*   The system could integrate with weather data for more realistic environmental effects (e.g., simulating a storm during a high-threat level).
*   User profiles could store preferred environmental responses based on time of day or activity.
*   The scent profiles could be curated by perfumers to create specific emotional responses.
*   AI could predict threat escalation based on historical data and adjust environmental responses proactively.
