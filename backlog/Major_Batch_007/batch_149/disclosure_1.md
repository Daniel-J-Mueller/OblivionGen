## Modular Conveyor with Dynamic Surface Adaptation

**System Overview:** A conveyor system utilizing hexagonal, individually controllable modules forming the belt surface. Each module can independently adjust its height and tilt, allowing for dynamic shaping of the conveyor surface to accommodate irregular or delicate items.

**Module Specifications:**

*   **Shape:** Hexagonal prism, 10cm diameter, 5cm height.
*   **Material:** Lightweight, high-strength polymer composite.
*   **Actuation:** Miniature linear actuators (piezoelectric or micro-servo) for height adjustment (0-2cm range). Miniature rotary actuators for tilt adjustment (-15 to +15 degrees).
*   **Power/Communication:** Wireless power transfer & communication (Qi standard or similar) with central control unit.
*   **Surface:** Replaceable, customizable surface tiles (e.g., textured rubber, low-friction coating, magnetic).
*   **Sensors:** Integrated proximity sensor to detect object presence and weight.

**Control System:**

*   **Central Processing Unit:** Real-time processing of sensor data and item tracking.
*   **Algorithm:** Predictive algorithm to anticipate item movement and dynamically adjust module positions.
*   **Input:** 3D model of items or real-time visual scanning (camera system) to determine shape and size.
*   **Output:** Control signals to individual modules, dictating height and tilt adjustments.
*   **Modes:**
    *   *Static Mode:* Traditional flat belt operation.
    *   *Conforming Mode:* Modules adjust to cradle and support items with irregular shapes.
    *   *Directional Mode:* Modules create angled surfaces to guide items along a specific path.
    *   *Sorting Mode:* Modules rise or lower to divert items into different lanes.

**System Architecture:**

1.  **Item Identification:** Item is identified (manually or via scanning) and its 3D model/dimensions are input into the control system.
2.  **Path Planning:** The control system calculates the optimal path and module adjustments for the item's journey.
3.  **Module Activation:** The control system sends signals to individual modules, activating the linear and rotary actuators.
4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Modules adjust their height and tilt in real-time as the item moves along the conveyor.
5.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Proximity sensors continuously monitor item position and weight, providing feedback to the control system.

**Pseudocode - Module Control Loop:**

```
For Each Module:
    Receive Control Signal (Height, Tilt) from Control System
    Read Proximity Sensor Data
    If Obstacle Detected:
        Adjust Height/Tilt to cradle/support item
        Send Feedback Data (position, weight) to Control System
    Else:
        Return to Default Position
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Handling delicate or irregularly shaped items (e.g., fruits, electronics).
*   Automated sorting and packaging systems.
*   Robotics integration (e.g., picking and placing items).
*   Customizable conveyor layouts for unique manufacturing processes.
