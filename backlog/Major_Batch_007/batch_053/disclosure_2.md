## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Predictive Muting

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply ignoring a detected wakeword *within* output audio. Instead, proactively reconstruct the acoustic scene *before* audio output, predict potential problematic 'loops' (wakeword in output triggering re-activation), and apply targeted muting *during* rendering to prevent these loops â€“ and even add creative audio effects.

**Specs:**

**1. Acoustic Scene Graph (ASG) Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw audio data intended for output, metadata indicating detected wakewords *in the source audio*.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Analyze the source audio to create a dynamic ASG representing sound events (speech, music, effects) and their relationships.
    *   Identify segments likely to *contain* the detected wakeword, based on phonetic analysis and acoustic similarity.
    *   Simulate the *predicted* output audio, including estimated reverb, filtering, and speaker characteristics.
    *   Identify potential 'feedback loops':  Where the predicted output *itself* is likely to trigger wakeword detection by the device's microphone.  This is assessed by running the simulated output through a wakeword detection model.
*   **Output:** ASG with probability scores indicating potential wakeword occurrences in predicted output, and 'loop risk' scores for those occurrences.

**2. Predictive Muting & Effects Engine:**

*   **Input:** ASG from the Acoustic Scene Graph Module, real-time audio stream to be output.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Based on the 'loop risk' scores, selectively mute or attenuate specific segments of the audio stream *before* they are output.  Muting isn't binary; it's granular, allowing for partial attenuation.
    *   Instead of *just* muting, apply creative audio effects to these segments to mask or subtly alter the wakeword. This could include frequency shifting, phase modulation, or the addition of subtle noise. The goal is to make the wakeword undetectable without severely impacting the audio quality.
    *   Dynamic adjustment: Continuously monitor the output audio via a dedicated, internal microphone (isolated from the main input) to verify the effectiveness of the muting/effects and adjust parameters in real-time.
*   **Output:** Modified audio stream with targeted muting and/or effects applied.

**3. Parameter Control & Learning Module:**

*   **Input:**  Effectiveness data from the dynamic monitoring (step 2), user preferences, environmental noise levels.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Machine learning algorithms (Reinforcement Learning recommended) to optimize muting/effects parameters based on the feedback.
    *   User profiles to personalize the experience (e.g., aggressive muting for quiet environments, subtle effects for critical listening).
    *   Environmental noise adaptation: Adjust parameters based on the ambient sound levels.
*   **Output:**  Optimized parameters for the Predictive Muting & Effects Engine.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Muting & Effects Engine):**

```
function apply_predictive_muting(audio_stream, ASG, parameters):
  for segment in ASG.segments:
    if segment.loop_risk > threshold:
      start_time = segment.start_time
      end_time = segment.end_time
      duration = end_time - start_time
      
      if parameters.muting_enabled:
        muted_audio = mute(audio_stream, start_time, end_time)
        audio_stream = muted_audio
      else if parameters.effects_enabled:
        effected_audio = apply_effect(audio_stream, start_time, end_time, parameters.effect_type, parameters.effect_intensity)
        audio_stream = effected_audio
  return audio_stream
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Dedicated, low-latency audio processing unit (DSP or FPGA)
*   Internal microphone for real-time monitoring
*   Sufficient memory for storing ASG and audio data
*   Low-latency audio interface

**Potential Applications:**

*   Voice assistants
*   Smart speakers
*   Automotive infotainment systems
*   Conferencing systems
*   Any device with a voice interface prone to accidental re-activation
