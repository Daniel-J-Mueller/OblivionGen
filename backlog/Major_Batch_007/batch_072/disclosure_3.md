## Adaptive Interference Cancellation via Predictive Beamforming

**Specification:** A system for proactively mitigating adjacent channel interference in multi-radio devices using predictive beamforming and a shared interference map.

**Core Concept:** Instead of *reacting* to detected interference (CCA thresholds), this system *predicts* potential interference sources and preemptively steers beams to nullify them *before* they impact data transmission. This is accomplished by dynamically building and sharing an interference map between radios, and utilizing a predictive algorithm to anticipate interference hotspots.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Radio Device:** Incorporates at least two WLAN radios with beamforming capabilities (digital or analog).
*   **Interference Map Module:** A dedicated hardware module within the device responsible for constructing and maintaining an interference map. This is a shared memory space accessible by all radios.
*   **Predictive Algorithm Engine:**  A hardware accelerator optimized for running a machine learning algorithm predicting interference based on historical data and real-time observations.
*   **Beamforming Control Unit:** A dedicated hardware circuit responsible for configuring the beamforming weights for each radio based on instructions from the Predictive Algorithm Engine.

**Software Components:**

*   **Interference Mapping Agent:** A software agent running on each radio responsible for collecting and reporting interference data to the Interference Map Module. This data includes signal strength, frequency, and direction of arrival.
*   **Predictive Algorithm:** A trained machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) that predicts interference hotspots based on historical data and real-time observations. The model is updated periodically with new data.
*   **Beamforming Control API:** An API that allows the Predictive Algorithm to control the beamforming weights for each radio.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Interference Mapping:** Each radio's Interference Mapping Agent continuously scans the surrounding environment for interference sources and reports the data to the Interference Map Module.
2.  **Map Construction:** The Interference Map Module aggregates the data from all radios to construct a shared interference map, representing the spatial distribution of interference sources.
3.  **Predictive Analysis:** The Predictive Algorithm analyzes the interference map and predicts potential interference hotspots, considering factors such as device mobility and channel usage.
4.  **Beamforming Control:** Based on the predictive analysis, the Predictive Algorithm instructs the Beamforming Control Unit to configure the beamforming weights for each radio, steering beams to nullify the predicted interference hotspots.
5.  **Adaptive Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors the interference environment and adjusts the beamforming weights in real-time to maintain optimal interference mitigation.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Predictive Algorithm):**

```
// Input: Interference Map, Device Mobility Data, Channel Usage Data
// Output: Beamforming Weights for each Radio

function predictInterference(interferenceMap, mobilityData, channelData) {
  // Historical Data: Interference patterns from past time steps
  historicalData = retrieveHistoricalData(interferenceMap);

  // Mobility Prediction: Predict device movement based on mobilityData
  predictedMovement = predictDeviceMovement(mobilityData);

  // Channel Prediction: Predict channel usage based on channelData
  predictedChannelUsage = predictChannelUsage(channelData);

  // Combine factors to predict interference hotspots
  interferenceHotspots = predictHotspots(historicalData, predictedMovement, predictedChannelUsage);

  // Calculate beamforming weights to nullify interference
  beamformingWeights = calculateWeights(interferenceHotspots);

  return beamformingWeights;
}
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond reactive interference mitigation to proactive interference cancellation. By predicting interference hotspots and preemptively steering beams, it can significantly improve wireless performance and reliability. The shared interference map and machine learning-based predictive algorithm enable a more coordinated and intelligent approach to interference management. Furthermore, the predictive element allows for anticipating interference *before* it impacts the signal. This could be particularly useful in dense environments or mobile scenarios.
