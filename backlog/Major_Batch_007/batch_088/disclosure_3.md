## Secure Workload Delegation with Dynamic Trust Anchors

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Concept:**  Extend the existing secure execution paradigm to incorporate *dynamic trust anchors* – ephemeral, cryptographically-verified assertions about the remote hardware's state *during* workload execution – allowing for granular, time-limited permission adjustments.  This goes beyond static attestation; it's continuous verification.

**II. Components:**

*   **Trust Anchor Generator (TAG):**  Software running *within* the remote hardware (or a trusted enclave within it).  Periodically (configurable interval - 100ms to 5s) generates a signed assertion (Trust Anchor) containing:
    *   Timestamp
    *   Hash of current memory state (selective – configurable regions, e.g., critical data structures)
    *   Hash of running processes/threads.
    *   Hardware performance counters (CPU usage, memory access patterns – used for anomaly detection).
    *   Digital signature (using a hardware-protected key).
*   **Trust Anchor Verifier (TAV):**  Component on the service provider network.  Receives Trust Anchors from the remote hardware.
    *   Verifies the digital signature.
    *   Compares current Trust Anchor with a baseline Trust Anchor (established during initial attestation).
    *   Applies anomaly detection algorithms (statistical analysis, machine learning) to identify deviations from the baseline or expected behavior.
*   **Policy Engine (PE):**  Resides on the service provider network.  Defines access control policies based on Trust Anchor data.  Policies can specify actions to take based on anomaly detection results (e.g., restrict access, terminate workload, trigger alert).  Uses a declarative policy language (e.g., Rego).
*   **Dynamic Permission Manager (DPM):**  Manages runtime permissions for the workload based on policies enforced by the Policy Engine. Implemented as a micro-kernel module within the remote hardware.

**III. Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Attestation:** Standard remote attestation process establishes a baseline Trust Anchor.
2.  **Continuous Trust Anchor Generation:** The TAG generates Trust Anchors at regular intervals.
3.  **Trust Anchor Transmission & Verification:** Trust Anchors are transmitted to the TAV and verified.
4.  **Policy Evaluation:** The Policy Engine evaluates the current Trust Anchor against defined policies.
5.  **Dynamic Permission Adjustment:** The DPM adjusts runtime permissions for the workload based on the Policy Engine's output.  This could include:
    *   Restricting access to specific memory regions.
    *   Limiting the number of system calls allowed.
    *   Reducing CPU priority.
6.  **Alerting & Remediation:** If an anomaly is detected that violates a policy, an alert is triggered, and automated remediation actions can be taken (e.g., workload termination).

**IV.  Pseudocode (Policy Engine - simplified example):**

```
// Policy: If CPU usage exceeds 90% for 5 consecutive Trust Anchors, restrict memory access.

function evaluatePolicy(trustAnchorData, historicalData) {
  if (trustAnchorData.cpuUsage > 0.9) {
    historicalData.highCpuCount++
  } else {
    historicalData.highCpuCount = 0
  }

  if (historicalData.highCpuCount >= 5) {
    // Apply restriction: Deny write access to critical memory region
    return { action: "restrict_memory", region: "critical_data" }
  } else {
    return { action: "allow" }
  }
}
```

**V. Integration with Existing System:**

*   The TAG and DPM are implemented within the remote hardware.
*   The TAV and PE reside on the service provider network, integrating with existing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   The existing token-based debugging system can be enhanced to incorporate trust anchor data, requiring a valid token *and* a passing trust anchor verification.

**VI. Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security against runtime attacks.
*   Granular control over workload execution.
*   Real-time adaptation to changing security threats.
*   Improved trust and transparency for customers.
