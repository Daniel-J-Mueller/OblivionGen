**Dynamic Metadata Attestation via Blockchain**

**Concept:** Extend the fleet node metadata system with a permissioned blockchain to provide immutable attestation of metadata validity and propagation status. This addresses potential tampering or inconsistencies, particularly in security-sensitive deployments.

**Specs:**

*   **Blockchain Type:** Permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda) – access controlled to fleet nodes and designated metadata mutation devices.
*   **Data Model:**
    *   *Metadata Hash:* Cryptographic hash of the dynamic metadata block.
    *   *Timestamp:* Time of metadata creation/modification.
    *   *Mutation Device ID:* Identifier of the device that initiated the change.
    *   *Attestation Signatures:* Digital signatures from a quorum of fleet nodes confirming receipt and validation of the metadata.
    *   *Version Number:* Integer representing metadata revision.
*   **Fleet Node Integration:**
    1.  Upon receiving updated metadata, a fleet node calculates the hash.
    2.  The node verifies the signature of the mutation device.
    3.  If valid, the node signs the metadata hash (along with its version number) with its private key.
    4.  The signature is added to the blockchain as an "attestation."
    5.  The node proceeds with using the updated metadata *only* if a sufficient number of attestations (defined by a configurable threshold) exist on the blockchain.
*   **Metadata Mutation Device Integration:**
    1.  Before propagating changes, the device writes the new metadata to the blockchain.
    2.  It initiates a “validation request” which triggers fleet node attestation.
    3.  Once the attestation threshold is reached, the device finalizes the metadata update.
*   **Conflict Resolution:**  If conflicting metadata versions are detected, the blockchain’s consensus mechanism determines the valid version.  (e.g. last confirmed block).
*   **Smart Contracts:** Employ smart contracts to automate:
    *   Metadata validation.
    *   Attestation threshold enforcement.
    *   Conflict resolution.
    *   Auditing and tracing of metadata changes.

**Pseudocode (Fleet Node):**

```
function receiveMetadataUpdate(metadata, signature) {
  if (verifySignature(signature, metadata)) {
    metadataHash = hash(metadata);
    attestationSignature = sign(metadataHash, privateKey);
    blockchain.addAttestation(metadataHash, attestationSignature);
    
    if(blockchain.hasSufficientAttestations(metadataHash, threshold)){
      applyMetadata(metadata);
    }
  }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Immutable audit trail and tamper-proof metadata.
*   **Increased Trust:** Verifiable metadata integrity.
*   **Improved Reliability:** Reduced risk of inconsistencies and errors.
*   **Simplified Auditing:** Easy tracking of metadata changes.
*   **Decentralized Validation:** Removes single points of failure.
