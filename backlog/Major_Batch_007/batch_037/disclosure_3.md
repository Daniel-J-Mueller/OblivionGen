## Dynamic Attribute Inheritance & Predictive Filtering

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical browsing system to dynamically inherit attributes across categories and proactively filter options based on user behavior and predictive modeling. The system would move beyond simple attribute assignment and prioritization to actively *learn* category-attribute relationships and anticipate user needs, creating a fluid, personalized browsing experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Attribute Inheritance Engine:**

*   **Data Structure:**  Introduce a “Relationship Graph” alongside the existing category/attribute hierarchies. Nodes represent categories/attributes. Edges represent the strength of the relationship (weighted value between 0-1). This graph is populated and refined via machine learning.
*   **Learning Mechanism:**  Employ a collaborative filtering approach. Track user selections. When a user consistently selects items with a particular attribute *within a specific category*, the Relationship Graph strengthens the edge connecting that category and attribute. Conversely, lack of selection weakens the connection.  Also, track co-occurrence. If attribute A and B are frequently selected together across various categories, strengthen the connection between A & B *directly in the Relationship Graph*, independent of category.
*   **Inheritance Rule:** When displaying attributes for a category, *also* display attributes linked to that category in the Relationship Graph, even if those attributes aren't *directly* assigned to the category in the original hierarchy.  Present these inherited attributes with a visual cue (e.g., dimmed icon) to indicate they are inferred, not explicitly assigned.
*   **Thresholding:** Implement adjustable thresholds for inheritance.  Higher thresholds mean only strong relationships are used, reducing noise but potentially missing relevant options. Lower thresholds increase sensitivity, but may present irrelevant choices.
*   **Propagation:** Allow inheritance to propagate.  If category A inherits attribute X from category B, and category B inherits attribute Y from category C, then, under certain conditions (adjustable weight), category A can inherit attribute Y. This creates a network of implied associations.

**2. Predictive Filtering Module:**

*   **User Profile:** Create a user profile that captures explicit preferences (e.g., saved filters) and implicit behavior (browsing history, purchase history, dwell time on specific attributes).
*   **Behavioral Modeling:** Use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model user browsing sequences. The RNN predicts the *next* attribute the user is likely to select, given their current category and past actions.
*   **Proactive Filtering:** Before displaying attributes for a category, the RNN predicts the most likely attributes. *Pre-select* these attributes (visually highlighted) in the UI. This provides a “smart default” filter, reducing the need for manual selection.
*   **Confidence Threshold:**  Only pre-select attributes with a confidence score above a certain threshold (adjustable). This prevents the system from making overly aggressive assumptions.
*   **Dynamic Weighting:** Combine the predictive filtering score with the inherited attribute strength. Attributes that are both strongly inherited and predicted by the user model are given the highest priority.

**3. UI Considerations:**

*   **Visual Cues:** Use distinct visual cues to differentiate between explicitly assigned attributes, inherited attributes, and predicted/pre-selected attributes.
*   **Transparency:** Provide a mechanism for users to understand *why* certain attributes are being suggested or pre-selected (e.g., a tooltip explaining the relationship or prediction score).
*   **Customization:** Allow users to override the system's suggestions and customize the filtering behavior.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Filtering):**

```
function display_attributes(category):
  attributes = get_explicit_attributes(category)
  inherited_attributes = get_inherited_attributes(category)
  predicted_attributes = predict_attributes(category, user_profile)

  combined_attributes = attributes + inherited_attributes + predicted_attributes
  ranked_attributes = rank_attributes(combined_attributes, user_profile)

  display ranked_attributes

function predict_attributes(category, user_profile):
  input_sequence = user_profile.browsing_history + [category]
  predicted_attributes = RNN(input_sequence)  // RNN outputs probabilities for each attribute
  filtered_attributes = filter_attributes_by_confidence(predicted_attributes, threshold)
  return filtered_attributes
```
