## Decentralized Data Sovereignty with Dynamic Access Control

**Concept:** Extend the client-side encryption paradigm to a fully decentralized system utilizing a blockchain-based access control layer. This shifts data sovereignty entirely to the user, rather than relying on a centralized content site, even for access permissions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Architecture:**

*   **Client-Side Encryption Module (CSEM):** Resides on the user's device (desktop, mobile). Handles all encryption/decryption operations. Utilizes authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) algorithms (e.g., ChaCha20-Poly1305, AES-GCM).
*   **Decentralized Access Control Layer (DACL):** A private, permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda) specifically for managing access permissions to encrypted data. 
*   **Data Shard Distribution Network (DSDN):** A distributed storage network (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin) responsible for storing encrypted data shards.
*   **Content Site Interface (CSI):**  A minimal interface for content sites.  Receives encrypted data and forwards it to the DSDN, and delivers shard locations to authorized users.  Does *not* decrypt or store decryption keys.

**2. Data Lifecycle:**

1.  **Data Creation:** User creates data on their device. CSEM encrypts the data using a symmetric key (Data Encryption Key - DEK).
2.  **Key Encryption & Access Policy:** CSEM encrypts the DEK using the public keys of authorized recipients (as in the provided patent). *Additionally*, CSEM creates an access policy defining conditions for access (e.g., time-based, location-based, device-based).  This policy is digitally signed by the user.
3.  **Data Sharding & Distribution:** The encrypted data is split into shards. These shards are distributed across the DSDN.
4.  **Metadata Storage & Blockchain Commitment:**  Metadata (shard locations, encrypted DEK, access policy, digital signature) is stored on the DACL. A hash of this metadata is committed to the blockchain for immutability and auditability.
5.  **Access Request:** An authorized user requests data. The CSI receives the request and verifies the user’s identity.
6.  **Policy Enforcement:** The CSI queries the DACL for the metadata associated with the requested data. The DACL enforces the access policy. If the policy is satisfied, the CSI returns the shard locations and the encrypted DEK.
7.  **Data Reconstruction & Decryption:** The user’s CSEM downloads the shards, reconstructs the encrypted data, and decrypts it using their private key.

**3. Pseudocode (CSEM - Key Management):**

```
function encryptData(data, recipientPublicKeys, accessPolicy):
  dek = generateSymmetricKey()
  encryptedData = encryptSymmetric(data, dek)
  encryptedDekList = []
  for publicKey in recipientPublicKeys:
    encryptedDek = encryptAsymmetric(dek, publicKey)
    encryptedDekList.append(encryptedDek)
  signedAccessPolicy = sign(accessPolicy, userPrivateKey)
  return encryptedData, encryptedDekList, signedAccessPolicy

function decryptData(encryptedData, encryptedDekList, signedAccessPolicy):
  verifiedAccessPolicy = verify(signedAccessPolicy, userPublicKey)
  if not verifiedAccessPolicy:
    return error("Access Denied - Invalid Policy")
  dek = decryptAsymmetric(encryptedDekList[0], userPrivateKey) # Use first key for simplicity, could iterate
  decryptedData = decryptSymmetric(encryptedData, dek)
  return decryptedData
```

**4. Enhancements:**

*   **Dynamic Access Control:** Access policies can be updated *after* data creation via smart contracts on the DACL. 
*   **Revocation:** Revoke access by updating the DACL with a blacklisted recipient.
*   **Data Auditing:**  The blockchain provides a complete audit trail of all access attempts and policy changes.
*   **Federated Identity:** Integrate with existing identity providers for seamless authentication.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Computation:** Implement zero-knowledge proofs to enable computation on encrypted data without decryption.

**5. Engineer Considerations:**

*   Blockchain selection is critical - consider throughput, scalability, and privacy features.
*   Efficient shard distribution and retrieval mechanisms are essential.
*   Secure key management is paramount.
*   Usable UI/UX for managing access policies.
*   Interoperability with existing content sites.
