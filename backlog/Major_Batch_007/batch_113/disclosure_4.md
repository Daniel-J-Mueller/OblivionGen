## Dynamic Behavioral Biometrics & Adaptive State Tokens

**Concept:** Enhance the existing state identifier system by integrating dynamic behavioral biometrics as a secondary, continuously validated authentication factor. Rather than *solely* relying on a secure token/cookie and matching session identifiers, layer in real-time user behavior analysis to establish a trust score. This adapts the security level dynamically.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Data Capture Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time user interaction data. This includes (but isn't limited to):
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure, patterns)
    *   Mouse movements (speed, acceleration, paths, click patterns)
    *   Scroll behavior (speed, patterns)
    *   Touchscreen interactions (pressure, swipe velocity, multi-touch gestures) - for mobile/touch interfaces.
    *   Device Orientation/Motion (accelerometer/gyroscope data for mobile)
*   **Processing:** Employ machine learning models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks) to establish a baseline behavioral profile for each user. This profile represents the typical patterns of interaction.
*   **Output:**  A ‘Behavioral Trust Score’ – a numerical value representing the similarity between the current user behavior and the established baseline.  Score ranges from 0-1 (0 being highly anomalous, 1 being a strong match).

**2. Adaptive State Token Generation:**

*   **Initial Token:**  Generate a standard secure state token (as in the existing patent).
*   **Behavioral Binding:**  When the initial token is established, *also* capture a short sequence of behavioral data (keystrokes, mouse movements, etc.). Encrypt this data and bind it to the token. This serves as the initial “behavioral anchor.”
*   **Token Update Frequency:**  Set a configurable update frequency (e.g., every 30 seconds, or after a certain number of interactions).
*   **Token Payload:** State ID, Behavioral Anchor, Current Behavioral Trust Score

**3. Submission Validation Process:**

1.  **Receive Submission:** Receive a submission request, including the State ID and the token.
2.  **Initial State ID Check:**  Verify the State ID as per the existing patent.  If it fails, proceed with the existing interstitial page flow.
3.  **Behavioral Data Capture:** During submission, actively capture new behavioral data.
4.  **Behavioral Trust Score Calculation:**  Compare the captured behavioral data against the Behavioral Anchor stored in the token and against the user's baseline profile. Calculate the Behavioral Trust Score.
5.  **Dynamic Thresholding:**
    *   **High Trust (Score > 0.8):**  Process the submission immediately.
    *   **Medium Trust (0.5 < Score < 0.8):**  Challenge the user with a lightweight secondary authentication factor (e.g., a simple image selection, a CAPTCHA, or a push notification to a trusted device).
    *   **Low Trust (Score < 0.5):**  Trigger a full interstitial page, similar to the existing patent, but *enhanced* with behavioral data visualization (e.g., displaying the user’s keystroke timing compared to their baseline). Request re-authentication, potentially with stronger factors.
6.  **Token Refresh:** If the submission is validated, update the Behavioral Anchor within the token with the latest behavioral data.  This continuously adapts the security level.

**4.  Anomaly Detection & Lockdown:**

*   Implement a real-time anomaly detection system that monitors Behavioral Trust Scores.
*   If a user’s score drops significantly below a configurable threshold, automatically lock the account or trigger a manual review.

**Pseudocode (Submission Validation):**

```
function validateSubmission(submission, token):
  stateID = submission.stateID
  behavioralData = captureBehavioralData(submission)

  if not verifyStateID(stateID, token):
    return generateInterstitialPage(stateID, token)

  behavioralAnchor = token.behavioralAnchor
  trustScore = calculateTrustScore(behavioralData, behavioralAnchor)

  if trustScore > 0.8:
    processSubmission(submission)
    updateToken(token, behavioralData)
    return success

  if trustScore > 0.5:
    challengeUser() // lightweight secondary auth
    if userPassesChallenge():
      processSubmission(submission)
      updateToken(token, behavioralData)
      return success
    else:
      return generateInterstitialPage(stateID, token)

  generateInterstitialPage(stateID, token)
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Federated Learning:**  Allow behavioral profiles to be updated using federated learning techniques to improve accuracy without sharing raw user data.
*   **Device Fingerprinting Integration:**  Combine behavioral biometrics with device fingerprinting to provide an even more robust security layer.
