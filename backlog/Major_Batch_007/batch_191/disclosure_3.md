## Adaptive Deception Layer

**Concept:** Extend the system to proactively *deceive* potential malicious actors, rather than just reacting to their activity. This isn’t about simple honeypots, but a dynamic, context-aware deception layer built *on top* of existing event monitoring.

**Specifications:**

**1. Deception Profile Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Parsed data (actor, action, entity, attributes) from the existing system. User-defined “sensitivity profiles” indicating critical assets/data.
*   **Process:** 
    *   Analyze parsed data to identify frequently accessed resources, common user behaviors, and typical workflow patterns.
    *   Generate “deception profiles” –  models of normal activity for specific actors, entities, and actions.  These profiles define expected parameters (e.g., file sizes, access times, network ports).
    *   Profiles are weighted based on sensitivity – higher weight for more critical assets.
*   **Output:**  Deception profiles stored in a searchable database.

**2. Dynamic Deception Injection Module:**

*   **Input:** Deception profiles, incoming event data, system resource availability.
*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor event data for deviations from established deception profiles.
    *   When a deviation is detected, dynamically inject subtle, context-aware “deceptions”. These are *not* alarms, but modifications to the perceived environment.  Examples:
        *   **File Modification:**  If an actor attempts to access a sensitive file, present a subtly altered copy (e.g., slightly older version, with added dummy data).
        *   **Network Redirection:** Redirect network traffic to a “shadow” server hosting a plausible but fake service.
        *   **Latency Injection:** Introduce minor delays in responses to certain actions.
        *   **Data Mirroring:** Mirror access attempts to a secondary logging system invisible to the actor.
    *   Deception level is dynamically adjusted based on actor behavior (e.g., increased deception if actor persists).
    *   All deceptions are logged for analysis.
*   **Output:**  Modified event data stream, deception logs.

**3. Deception Feedback Loop:**

*   **Input:** Deception logs, event data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze deception logs to determine the effectiveness of injected deceptions.  (e.g., did the actor detect the deception? Did they alter their behavior?)
    *   Use this feedback to refine deception profiles and improve injection strategies.
    *   Identify actor “signatures” based on their response to deceptions.
*   **Output:**  Updated deception profiles, actor signatures.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Deception Injection Module):**

```
function inject_deception(event_data, deception_profiles):
  actor = event_data.actor
  action = event_data.action
  entity = event_data.entity

  profile = lookup_profile(deception_profiles, actor, action, entity)

  if profile is null:
    return event_data // No profile, no deception

  if deviation_detected(event_data, profile):
    deception_type = select_deception_type(profile)
    modified_event_data = apply_deception(event_data, deception_type)
    log_deception(modified_event_data, deception_type)
    return modified_event_data
  else:
    return event_data
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Minimal impact on existing infrastructure.  Leverage existing server resources for deception injection.
*   Network bandwidth monitoring to prevent excessive latency.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Ensure deception injection does not disrupt legitimate user activity.
*   Secure the deception profile database to prevent tampering.
*   Implement robust logging and auditing of all deception-related activities.
