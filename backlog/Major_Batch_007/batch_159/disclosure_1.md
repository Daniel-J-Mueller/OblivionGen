## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Tagging & Sharing

**Concept:** Expand beyond facial recognition to incorporate real-time emotional analysis of subjects *within* photographs, and correlate that emotional data with recipient emotional profiles to optimize sharing. The goal is to predict not just *who* to share with, but *which* photos of a person will resonate most strongly with a given contact.

**Specs:**

**1. Emotion Capture Module:**

*   **Input:** Digital photograph/video stream.
*   **Process:** Utilizes advanced AI (beyond basic facial expression recognition) to detect and quantify emotional states within the image. This includes:
    *   Facial micro-expression analysis (subtle muscle movements).
    *   Body language assessment (posture, gesture).
    *   Environmental context analysis (scene recognition to infer emotional cues – e.g., a beach scene implies relaxation).
*   **Output:**  An “Emotional Resonance Vector” (ERV) – a multi-dimensional array representing the dominant emotional states present in the image (e.g., Joy: 0.8, Sadness: 0.1, Anger: 0.05, Surprise: 0.2).

**2. Recipient Emotional Profile (REP):**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Historical Sharing Data: Analyze past shared photos *and* recipient reactions (likes, comments, time spent viewing).
    *   Social Media Integration (Optional, with user consent): Analyze public social media posts and activity to infer emotional preferences.
    *   Direct User Input (Optional): Allow users to explicitly indicate their emotional preferences (e.g., "I prefer seeing photos of people smiling," "I'm not a fan of overly dramatic content").
*   **Process:** AI constructs a REP for each contact, representing their preferred emotional 'palette' – the types of emotional content they are most likely to respond positively to.
*   **Output:**  A REP vector, analogous to the ERV, representing the recipient's emotional preferences.

**3. Resonance Matching Engine:**

*   **Input:** ERV (from image), REP (from contact).
*   **Process:**  Calculates a “Resonance Score” based on the similarity between the ERV and REP.  This isn't a simple dot product; it incorporates weighted factors.  For example:
    *   **Alignment Weight:**  Positive weight for matching emotional states (e.g., Joy in image + Joy in profile = high score).
    *   **Contrast Weight:**  Negative weight for strongly contrasting emotional states (e.g., Anger in image + Joy in profile = low score).  However, *intentional* contrast might be beneficial for certain profiles (e.g., a profile that shows a preference for "dark humor").
    *   **Emotional Intensity:**  Weighting based on the intensity of the emotion. A subtle smile might be better for a calm profile, while a boisterous laugh might resonate with a high-energy profile.
*   **Output:** Resonance Score (0-1).  Higher score indicates a stronger predicted emotional connection.

**4. Smart Share Recommendation System:**

*   **Process:** When a user is about to share a photo:
    1.  The Emotion Capture Module analyzes the photo to generate the ERV.
    2.  For each contact, the Resonance Matching Engine calculates the Resonance Score.
    3.  The system ranks contacts based on their Resonance Scores.
    4.  The system presents a recommended sharing list, prioritizing contacts with the highest scores.
    5.  The system includes a "Resonance Indicator" – a visual cue indicating the predicted strength of the emotional connection (e.g., a star rating).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function analyzeImage(image):
  ERV = emotionCaptureModule(image)
  return ERV

function calculateResonanceScore(ERV, REP):
  alignmentScore = dotProduct(ERV, REP) * alignmentWeight
  contrastScore = calculateContrast(ERV, REP) * contrastWeight
  intensityScore = calculateIntensityDifference(ERV, REP) * intensityWeight
  resonanceScore = alignmentScore + contrastScore + intensityScore
  return resonanceScore

function recommendShare(image, contacts):
  ERV = analyzeImage(image)
  scoredContacts = []
  for contact in contacts:
    REP = getRecipientEmotionalProfile(contact)
    score = calculateResonanceScore(ERV, REP)
    scoredContacts.append((contact, score))

  scoredContacts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  return scoredContacts
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus primarily on *who* a user shares with based on past interactions. This system focuses on *which* photos will evoke the strongest emotional response in the recipient, based on both the content of the photo and the recipient’s emotional profile.  It’s a shift from social graph analysis to emotional resonance analysis.
