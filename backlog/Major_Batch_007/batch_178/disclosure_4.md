## Adaptive Frequency Hopping Synchronization

**Concept:** Extending the synchronization pulse security beyond timing windows to include frequency domain verification. This addresses potential spoofing attacks where a malicious actor mimics the timing *and* frequency of the synchronization pulse, but not the intended hopping sequence.

**Specs:**

*   **System Component:** Add a Frequency Hopping Module (FHM) to each integrated circuit device.
*   **FHM Operation:**
    *   The FHM maintains a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) seeded with a system-wide key.
    *   The PRNG generates a frequency offset value for each synchronization pulse interval.
    *   The signal generator modulates the synchronization pulse with the generated frequency offset before transmission.
    *   The count controller contains a corresponding FHM, synchronized with the system-wide key.
*   **Synchronization Process:**
    1.  The count controller monitors the synchronization signal.
    2.  Upon detecting a pulse, the FHM calculates the expected frequency offset.
    3.  The controller demodulates the received pulse using the calculated offset.
    4.  A valid pulse is only confirmed if the demodulated signal matches the expected pattern *and* falls within the security window.
    5.  If the frequency check fails, a security violation is reported.
    6.  Alignment of the local count value proceeds *only* on successful frequency and timing verification.

**Pseudocode (Count Controller):**

```
function onSynchronizationPulseDetected():
  pulseFrequency = detectPulseFrequency(synchronizationSignal)
  expectedFrequency = generateExpectedFrequency(systemKey)

  if (abs(pulseFrequency - expectedFrequency) < frequencyTolerance):
    if (pulseArrivalTime within securityWindow):
      alignLocalCountValue(impliedCountValue)
    else:
      reportSecurityViolation(timingError)
  else:
    reportSecurityViolation(frequencyError)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Low-power, high-resolution frequency synthesizers for modulation/demodulation.
*   Dedicated hardware for PRNG implementation to minimize latency and power consumption.
*   Robust shielding to mitigate external interference.

**Innovation Notes:**

This isn’t about *improving* timing security, but augmenting it. While the original patent focuses on *when* a pulse arrives, this adds *what* the pulse 'sounds' like – a unique, dynamic identifier. It assumes an attacker doesn’t have the seed for the PRNG, making frequency spoofing significantly harder.
