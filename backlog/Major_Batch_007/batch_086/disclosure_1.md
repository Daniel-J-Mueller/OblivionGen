## Dynamic Permission Drift & Temporal Access Keys

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical identity projection to incorporate *temporal* access permissions and a system of “permission drift” based on user behavior & organizational changes. Instead of simply inheriting permissions from a higher-level account, access can *evolve* over time, adapting to the user's role and the organization's needs.

**Specifications:**

**1. Temporal Access Keys (TAK):**

*   **Generation:** Upon initial authentication via the hierarchical system (as defined in the provided patent), a TAK is generated. This TAK isn't static; it contains a lifespan and a set of “drift parameters.”
*   **Drift Parameters:** These parameters dictate *how* permissions can change over time. Examples include:
    *   `AccessFrequencyThreshold`:  If a user accesses a resource X times within a defined period, permission to a related resource Y is automatically granted.
    *   `RoleChangeSensitivity`:  How quickly permissions adapt to changes in the user’s organizational role (e.g., promotion, department transfer).
    *   `ResourceAffinity`:  Permissions are boosted for resources the user interacts with frequently.
*   **TAK Renewal:** TAKs are periodically renewed. Renewal evaluates drift parameters against user activity logs and organizational updates.  New permissions or restrictions are applied.
*   **TAK Revocation:** TAKs can be revoked manually (e.g., employee termination) or automatically (e.g., security breach).

**2. Permission Drift Engine:**

*   **Real-time Activity Monitoring:** Captures user interactions with resources (access, modification, creation).
*   **Organizational Graph:** A dynamic representation of the organizational hierarchy, roles, and relationships.  Updated via HR systems and active directory.
*   **Drift Rule Engine:** Evaluates activity logs against defined drift rules (specified by administrators). Uses machine learning to suggest optimal drift rules based on user behavior patterns.
*   **Permission Adjustment:** Automatically modifies user permissions based on drift rule evaluation.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **TAK Service:** Responsible for TAK generation, renewal, and revocation. Interacts with the Organizational Graph and Activity Logger.
*   **Activity Logger:** Records all user interactions with resources. Stores data in a time-series database.
*   **Organizational Graph Database:** Stores the dynamic organizational hierarchy and roles.  Supports real-time updates.
*   **Resource Access Proxy:** Intercepts all resource access requests. Validates TAKs and applies dynamic permissions.

**Pseudocode (Resource Access Proxy):**

```
function accessResource(user, resource, action):
    TAK = retrieveTAK(user)
    if TAK is invalid:
        denyAccess()
        return

    permissions = retrievePermissions(TAK)

    if permissions.allows(action):
        allowAccess()
        logAccess(user, resource, action)
        updateTAK(user, resource, action) // Triggers permission drift evaluation
    else:
        denyAccess()
        logDenial(user, resource, action)
```

**4.  Organizational Policy Integration:**

*   Administrators define "permission drift policies" that govern how permissions evolve.
*   Policies can be applied globally, to specific organizational units, or even to individual users.
*   A policy engine ensures that drift rules adhere to organizational security and compliance standards.

**Novelty:** This expands the core concept beyond static hierarchical projection to a dynamic, adaptive permission system driven by user behavior and organizational changes. It introduces the concepts of temporal access keys, permission drift policies, and a drift engine, creating a more flexible and secure access control model.  The use of machine learning to suggest optimal drift rules is a key differentiator.
