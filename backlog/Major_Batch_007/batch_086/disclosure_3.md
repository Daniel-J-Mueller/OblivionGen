## Dynamic Rule Inheritance & Reputation System

**Concept:** Expand the access/change rule system to include a dynamic inheritance model coupled with a client reputation score. This allows for more granular control beyond simple threshold approvals and introduces incentive mechanisms for responsible behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Reputation Score Calculation:**

*   **Base Score:** Each client begins with a neutral reputation score (e.g., 500).
*   **Positive Actions:**
    *   Approving rule changes that later demonstrably improve system efficiency or security (verified via automated monitoring). +5-20 points.
    *   Proposing rule changes that are approved by a supermajority (e.g. 80%). +10-30 points.
    *   Successfully flagging malicious access attempts (false positives penalized). +5-15 points.
*   **Negative Actions:**
    *   Approving rule changes that demonstrably degrade system efficiency or security. -10-30 points.
    *   Submitting frivolous or malicious access requests. -10-20 points.
    *   Repeatedly failing authentication attempts. -5 points per attempt after a threshold.
*   **Decay:** Reputation score slowly decays over time if no actions are taken. (e.g. -0.1 points per day)

**2. Rule Inheritance Hierarchy:**

*   **Global Rules:** System-wide rules apply to all clients.
*   **Group Rules:** Clients can be assigned to groups (e.g., department, project).  Groups inherit global rules and can define additional rules specific to that group.
*   **Client Rules:** Clients can define rules that *override* group rules, but only within specific, pre-defined parameters set by the group/system admin.  (e.g., a client can define more restrictive access to a subset of data, but cannot broaden access).
*   **Dynamic Inheritance:** Rules can be dynamically inherited based on context. For example, a rule could be activated only when a specific dataset is accessed, or during a particular time window.

**3. Rule Change Approval Process (Modified):**

*   **Reputation Weighting:**  During rule change approval, each client's vote is weighted by their current reputation score.  Higher reputation = more influence.
*   **Tiered Approval Thresholds:**  The required approval threshold for a rule change depends on the *scope* of the change and the *risk* involved, as well as weighted reputation. 
    *   **Low-Risk/Narrow Scope:** Simple majority (weighted)
    *   **Medium-Risk/Medium Scope:** Supermajority (e.g., 66% weighted)
    *   **High-Risk/Broad Scope:**  Near-Unanimity (e.g., 90% weighted) *and* approval from designated ‘guardian’ accounts.
*   **Automated Risk Assessment:** An AI-powered system analyzes proposed rule changes and assigns a risk score. This score is used to determine the appropriate approval threshold.

**4. Enforcement Function Enhancement:**

*   **Contextual Rule Application:** The enforcement function considers the client's reputation score, group membership, and current context to determine which rules apply.
*   **Adaptive Access Control:** If a client's reputation score drops below a certain threshold, their access privileges are automatically reduced.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** The system monitors access patterns and flags suspicious activity based on deviations from the client’s normal behavior.

**Pseudocode (Enforcement Function):**

```
function enforceAccess(request, sharedResource) {
  client = request.client;
  rules = getApplicableRules(client, sharedResource); // Considers group, client, context
  riskScore = assessRisk(request, rules);

  if (client.reputation < riskThreshold) {
    denyAccess(request);
    logSuspiciousActivity(client);
    return;
  }

  if (riskScore > acceptableRiskLevel) {
    requireMultiFactorAuth(request);
  }

  if (rules.allowAccess(request)) {
    performOperation(request, sharedResource);
    logAccess(request);
  } else {
    denyAccess(request);
    logDenial(request);
  }
}
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Scalable reputation scoring system.
*   Robust risk assessment algorithm.
*   Efficient rule engine that supports dynamic inheritance.
*   Secure logging and auditing mechanisms.
*   AI/ML models for risk assessment and anomaly detection.
