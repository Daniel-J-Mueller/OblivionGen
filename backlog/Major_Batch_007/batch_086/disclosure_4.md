## Dynamic Content Consumption Zones

**Concept:** Augment the proximity-based user identification system with dynamically defined “content zones” within a physical space. These zones aren’t fixed but are created and adjusted in real-time based on user preferences, activity, or even environmental factors.

**Specs:**

*   **Zone Creation Interface:** A mobile app or web interface allowing authorized users (e.g., homeowners, business owners) to define content zones. Parameters include:
    *   **Zone Shape:** Geometric shapes (circle, rectangle, polygon) or freehand drawing on a floor plan.
    *   **Zone Size:** Adjustable dimensions.
    *   **Content Profile:** Selection of content categories, specific content items, or preferred streaming services.
    *   **User Association:** Assignment of user accounts or groups to the zone.
    *   **Trigger Conditions:** Event-based triggers (e.g., time of day, motion detection, sound levels) that activate or modify the content profile.
*   **Proximity System Integration:** The existing proximity detection system identifies devices and their associated user accounts.
*   **Zone Mapping Engine:** A software module that maps detected devices to the closest active content zone.
*   **Content Delivery System:**  A system to deliver relevant content to displays within the identified zone. Displays could be TVs, smart mirrors, projectors, or integrated into furniture.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors user activity within zones (via device sensors) and adjusts the content profile accordingly. Examples:
    *   If multiple users are detected in a zone and are actively watching the same content, the system can prioritize that content for all displays in the zone.
    *   If a user enters a zone while engaged in a specific activity (e.g., cooking, exercising), the system can automatically display relevant content (e.g., recipes, workout videos).
*   **Environmental Sensor Integration:** Integration with environmental sensors (temperature, lighting, noise) to adjust content. For instance:
    *   Darken the display and play ambient music in a zone when the lights are dimmed.
    *   Display news or weather information in a zone when a storm is detected.

**Pseudocode (Zone Mapping Engine):**

```
FUNCTION MapDeviceToZone(deviceInfo, zoneList)
    closestZone = NULL
    minDistance = INFINITY

    FOR EACH zone IN zoneList
        distance = CalculateDistance(deviceInfo.location, zone.location)

        IF distance < minDistance
            minDistance = distance
            closestZone = zone
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    IF closestZone != NULL
        RETURN closestZone
    ELSE
        RETURN DefaultZone //Fallback if no zones are defined
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Example Use Cases:**

*   **Smart Home:** Different zones in a home can have different content profiles for each family member.
*   **Retail:** Zones within a store can display targeted advertisements or product information based on customer proximity and browsing history.
*   **Gym:** Zones around different exercise equipment can display workout videos or motivational content.
*   **Hospitality:** Zones in hotel rooms can provide personalized entertainment options for each guest.
