**Dynamic Digital Asset "Lifecycles" & Collaborative Creation Suites**

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple storage & delivery of digital goods to encompass full lifecycle management, fostering collaborative creation *within* the platform, and enabling persistent, evolving digital assets.

**Specs:**

1.  **Asset Core:** Every digital asset isn't merely a file; it's an object with metadata defining its "lifecycle stage" (Draft, In Review, Published, Archived, Evolved).  This is a required field.

2.  **Evolutionary Branches:**  Assets can “branch” – creating variations without overwriting the original.  Think of it like Git for digital goods.  A musician publishes a song; fans can create remixes, triggering new branches automatically tied to the original for royalty tracking.

3.  **Collaborative Workspaces:** Each asset/branch has a dedicated workspace.  Multiple users (creator, collaborators, community members) can access (permission-controlled) to contribute.  Integrated tools for:
    *   **Real-time editing:**  Basic, cloud-based image/audio/text editors.  Direct integration with popular creative suites (Adobe, etc.).
    *   **Version control:**  Automatic tracking of all changes.  Ability to revert to previous versions.
    *   **Commenting/Annotation:**  Directly on the asset.
    *   **Task Management:**  Assign tasks related to the asset (e.g., “Create thumbnail,” “Mix vocals”).

4.  **Smart Contracts & Revenue Sharing:**  Built-in smart contract engine to automate revenue sharing based on contribution.  If a remix earns revenue, the original artist & remixer automatically receive their pre-defined share.

5.  **"Evolving Assets" & Dynamic Pricing:**  Assets don't have static pricing. Pricing *evolves* based on:
    *   Community engagement (likes, shares, remixes).
    *   Rarity of variations.
    *   Creator-defined rules (e.g., “Price increases by 1% for every 100 remixes”).

6.  **API Integrations:**  Open API to allow third-party developers to build apps & integrations:
    *   AI-powered content creation tools.
    *   Gamification layers.
    *   Virtual/Augmented Reality experiences.

**Pseudocode (Revenue Sharing):**

```
function calculateRevenueShare(assetID, contributorID, revenueAmount) {
  // Get revenue split from database based on assetID & contributorID
  revenueSplit = getRevenueSplit(assetID, contributorID);

  // Calculate share for contributor
  contributorShare = revenueAmount * revenueSplit.percentage;

  // Record transaction
  recordTransaction(assetID, contributorID, contributorShare);

  return contributorShare;
}

function getRevenueSplit(assetID, contributorID) {
  // Query database for revenue split agreement
  agreement = db.query("SELECT percentage FROM revenue_splits WHERE asset_id = ? AND contributor_id = ?", [asset_id, contributor_id]);
  return agreement;
}
```

**Engine Core Components**

*   **Digital Asset Manager (DAM):** Responsible for storage, versioning, metadata management, and access control.
*   **Smart Contract Engine:** Executes revenue sharing agreements and other automated actions.
*   **Collaboration Server:** Handles real-time communication, task management, and workspace management.
*   **API Gateway:** Provides access to the platform’s functionality for third-party developers.
*   **Blockchain Integration:** (Optional) To provide transparent and immutable records of ownership and transactions.
