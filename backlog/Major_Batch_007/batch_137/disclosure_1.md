## Dynamic Surface Mapping & Predictive Tamp Head Adjustment

**Concept:** Integrate a structured light scanner *above* the conveyor belt, projecting a dynamic grid onto the object surface *before* it reaches the tamp head. This creates a real-time, high-resolution surface map, going beyond simple discontinuity detection to encompass subtle curves, textures, and potential adhesion points. This map then *predictively* adjusts the tamp head – not just rotation, but also *pressure* and *angle* of application – to maximize label adhesion and appearance, even on complex geometries.

**Specs:**

*   **Scanner:** Time-of-Flight or Structured Light scanner, resolution > 500 DPI, field of view encompassing entire object width. Mounted rigidly above conveyor, 30-50mm clearance. Sampling rate >= 30 Hz.
*   **Data Processing Unit:** Dedicated GPU/FPGA for real-time point cloud processing. Algorithms: noise filtering, surface normal estimation, feature extraction (curves, edges, textures).
*   **Predictive Algorithm:** Machine learning model trained on label adhesion data (various materials, surfaces, pressures). Input: surface map, object speed, label material properties. Output: optimal tamp head rotation, pressure, and application angle.
*   **Tamp Head Actuators:**
    *   Rotational actuator: Precision stepper motor with encoder, resolution < 0.1 degree.
    *   Pressure actuator: Pneumatic or servo-controlled actuator, force range 1-10 N, resolution 0.1 N.
    *   Angle Actuator: Miniature servo controlling tamp head pitch/yaw, range +/-5 degrees, resolution 0.1 degree.
*   **Integration:** Communication interface (Ethernet/IP, PROFINET) between scanner, data processing unit, and tamp head actuators. Synchronization with conveyor encoder to correlate surface map with object position.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Main Loop (triggered by conveyor encoder pulse)
function ProcessObject(objectPosition) {

    // 1. Acquire Surface Map
    surfaceMap = ScanObject(objectPosition);

    // 2. Pre-process Surface Map
    cleanedMap = FilterNoise(surfaceMap);
    normals = CalculateSurfaceNormals(cleanedMap);
    features = ExtractFeatures(normals);

    // 3. Predict Optimal Tamp Parameters
    [rotation, pressure, angle] = PredictTampParameters(features, labelMaterial, objectSpeed);

    // 4. Adjust Tamp Head
    SetTampHeadRotation(rotation);
    SetTampHeadPressure(pressure);
    SetTampHeadAngle(angle);

    // 5. Apply Label (standard tamp head cycle)
}
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems focus on *reactive* adjustments based on detected discontinuities. This system is *proactive*, using a detailed surface map to *predict* the optimal application parameters *before* contact, enhancing both adhesion and label appearance. The inclusion of pressure and angle control, guided by a predictive model, represents a significant advancement in tamp head technology.
