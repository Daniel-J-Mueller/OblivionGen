## Dynamic Network Persona Generation & Policy Enforcement

**Concept:** Extend the context-aware DLP system to *dynamically* generate network personas for users, based on observed behavior and integrate those personas into policy enforcement. This moves beyond static organizational/service definitions to *adaptive* security.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Network flow data (packet headers, payload metadata – excluding sensitive content initially), user authentication data, time of day, location data (if available/permitted).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Behavioral Analysis:** Employ machine learning (specifically, clustering and anomaly detection algorithms) to group network activity patterns.  Focus on:
        *   Applications used (categorized – e.g., productivity, communication, entertainment)
        *   Data transfer sizes and frequencies
        *   Destination IPs/domains (categorized – e.g., cloud storage, social media, financial institutions)
        *   Time-based patterns (e.g., peak usage hours)
    *   **Persona Creation:**  Assign users to dynamically created personas. Example personas: "Remote Worker - High Productivity," "Mobile User - Social Media Focused," "Internal Developer - Code Repository Access".
    *   **Persona Scoring:**  Assign a confidence score to each persona assignment based on the strength of the behavioral matches. The system will track multiple potential personas for each user with associated confidence scores.
*   **Output:** List of user personas with associated confidence scores, continuously updated.

**2. Policy Integration Module:**

*   **Input:** DLP policies, user personas (with confidence scores), network flow data.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Policy Augmentation:**  DLP policies are dynamically extended to include persona-specific rules.  For example:
        *   "If user is assigned persona 'Remote Worker - High Productivity' AND accessing cloud storage, allow larger file uploads."
        *   “If user is assigned persona 'Mobile User – Social Media Focused’ AND attempting to access internal financial data, flag for review.”
    *   **Weighted Policy Enforcement:**  Combine standard DLP rules with persona-based rules, weighting the enforcement based on the persona confidence score.  Higher confidence = stronger enforcement of persona-based rules.  Example:
        *   Standard DLP rule: Block transmission of credit card numbers.
        *   Persona rule (for "Internal Developer"): Allow transmission of test credit card numbers *to specific testing servers*
        *   Enforcement Logic: If persona confidence for "Internal Developer" is > 80%, permit transmission to the testing servers; otherwise, apply the standard DLP block.
*   **Output:** Enforcement decisions (permit, block, log, redirect) for each network flow.

**3.  Feedback Loop & Policy Refinement:**

*   **Process:** Monitor enforcement decisions and user behavior. Use this data to:
    *   **Refine Persona Models:** Improve the accuracy of persona assignment.
    *   **Adapt Policies:** Automatically adjust policy weights and rules based on observed effectiveness. For example, if a persona frequently triggers false positives, lower the weight of persona-based rules for that persona.
    *   **Identify New Personas:** Discover emerging user behavior patterns that warrant the creation of new personas.

**Pseudocode (Policy Enforcement):**

```
function enforcePolicy(networkFlow, user, dlpPolicy, personaList):
  standardDLPResult = applyStandardDLP(networkFlow, dlpPolicy)

  if standardDLPResult == BLOCKED:
    return BLOCKED

  for persona in personaList:
    if persona.confidence > threshold:
      personaRuleResult = applyPersonaRule(networkFlow, persona, dlpPolicy)

      if personaRuleResult == PERMIT:
        return PERMIT
      elif personaRuleResult == BLOCKED:
        //Weighted decision - potentially override standard rule
        if persona.confidence > overrideThreshold:
          return BLOCKED

  return standardDLPResult // Fallback to standard DLP
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance network packet processing engine.
*   Scalable data storage for behavioral data and persona models.
*   Machine learning platform for persona creation and policy refinement.
*   API for integrating with existing DLP systems.
