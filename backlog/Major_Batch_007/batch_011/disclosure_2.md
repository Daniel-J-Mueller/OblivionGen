## Adaptive Trust Scoring & Dynamic Access Control

**Concept:** Extend the network traffic inspection to incorporate real-time trust scoring of the user and the accessed third-party site, dynamically adjusting access control beyond simple rule compliance. This goes beyond blocking/allowing – it modulates *how* access is granted.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Trust Engine:** A modular system for assigning trust scores. Inputs:
    *   **User Behavior:** Derived from network traffic (access patterns, data transfer volumes, time of day, location).  Anomaly detection algorithms identify deviations from established baselines.
    *   **Third-Party Site Reputation:**  A continuously updated feed incorporating data from threat intelligence sources, user reports, and independent security assessments.
    *   **Data Sensitivity:** Classification of data being accessed/transferred based on metadata (file type, keywords, source/destination).
    *   **Organizational Policy:** Weighted rules defined by administrators regarding acceptable risk levels for different user groups and data types.
*   **Dynamic Access Controller:**  A policy engine that uses the Trust Engine’s output to modulate access levels.  Levels include:
    *   **Full Access:**  Unrestricted access (highest trust).
    *   **Restricted Access:**  Limited functionality or data exposure.  Example:  Read-only access, reduced file download sizes, temporary account access.
    *   **Sandboxed Access:**  Access through a secure, isolated environment.  All activity is monitored and potentially logged/blocked.
    *   **Blocked Access:**  Access denied (lowest trust).

**II. Data Flow & Processing:**

1.  **Traffic Interception:** As in the source patent, network traffic is intercepted.
2.  **Feature Extraction:**  Relevant features are extracted from the traffic (URLs, data types, user agent, timestamps, etc.).
3.  **Trust Score Calculation:** The Trust Engine calculates a trust score for the user and the third-party site. This involves:
    *   User Profile Lookup: Retrieve historical behavior data.
    *   Real-Time Anomaly Detection: Identify suspicious patterns.
    *   Reputation Lookup:  Fetch third-party site reputation score.
    *   Policy Enforcement: Apply organizational rules and weighting factors.
4.  **Dynamic Access Decision:** The Dynamic Access Controller determines the appropriate access level based on the combined trust scores and pre-defined policies.
5.  **Access Modulation:**  Access is granted or restricted based on the decision. This could involve:
    *   Proxying traffic through a sandboxed environment.
    *   Modifying HTTP headers to limit functionality.
    *   Blocking specific URLs or file types.
6.  **Logging & Monitoring:**  All access decisions and relevant data are logged for audit and analysis.

**III. Pseudocode (Dynamic Access Controller):**

```
function determineAccessLevel(userTrustScore, siteTrustScore, dataSensitivity) {

  if (userTrustScore < threshold_low AND siteTrustScore < threshold_low) {
    return "Blocked Access";
  }

  if (userTrustScore < threshold_medium OR siteTrustScore < threshold_medium) {
    if (dataSensitivity == "High") {
      return "Sandboxed Access";
    } else {
      return "Restricted Access";
    }
  }

  if (dataSensitivity == "High" AND siteTrustScore < threshold_high) {
    return "Sandboxed Access";
  }

  return "Full Access";
}
```

**IV. Implementation Notes:**

*   The Trust Engine should be highly modular and extensible to support new data sources and algorithms.
*   Threshold values for trust scores should be configurable and adjustable based on organizational risk tolerance.
*   The system should be able to handle high volumes of traffic with minimal latency.
*   A user interface should be provided for administrators to configure policies, monitor trust scores, and investigate security incidents.
*   Integration with existing Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems is crucial.
