## Dynamic Data Masking via Delegated Policy Inference

**Concept:** Extend the delegation policy system to include *dynamic* data masking rules. Instead of just read/write access, the delegation service infers masking rules based on the user's role, the data being accessed, and potentially, real-time contextual factors. This moves beyond simple row/column access control to intelligently obfuscate sensitive data *within* the returned results, without altering the underlying data.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Policy Extension:** The delegation policy definition language is extended to include “masking rules”. These rules are structured as conditional statements:

    ```
    IF (user_role == "marketing" AND data_field == "credit_card_number") THEN
      MASK_FIELD(data_field, method="replace_with_x")
    ELSE IF (user_role == "support" AND data_field == "social_security_number") THEN
      MASK_FIELD(data_field, method="partial_redaction", length=3)
    ELSE
      NO_MASKING
    ENDIF
    ```

    `MASK_FIELD` takes the field name and a masking *method* as arguments. Methods include: `replace_with_x`, `partial_redaction`, `date_obfuscation`, `email_obfuscation`, `hashing`, `tokenization`.
2.  **Contextual Awareness:** The delegation service receives contextual information along with the access request. This may include:
    *   User's current location (IP-based or GPS if permissible)
    *   Time of day
    *   Device type
    *   Application initiating the request
3.  **Policy Inference Engine:** A new component within the delegation service, the “Policy Inference Engine,” evaluates the delegation policy *and* contextual information to dynamically determine the appropriate masking rules for each data field.
4.  **Data Transformation Proxy:**  A proxy service intercepts data returned from the database *before* it reaches the client. It applies the masking rules determined by the Policy Inference Engine.
5.  **API Integration:**  The database service receives requests *with* masking specifications as part of the query. This could be a new query parameter or a header field. The database doesn’t *enforce* masking, it simply notes the requested masking and returns the raw data, enabling the proxy to perform the transformation.
6.  **Monitoring & Audit:** All masking actions are logged, including the user, data field, masking method, and context. This provides a clear audit trail for compliance purposes.

**Pseudocode (Data Transformation Proxy):**

```
FUNCTION transform_data(raw_data, masking_specifications, delegation_policy, context)

  transformed_data = raw_data

  FOR each field IN transformed_data
    field_name = field.name

    masking_rule = lookup_masking_rule(field_name, delegation_policy, context)

    IF masking_rule != NONE
      transformed_data[field_name] = apply_masking_rule(transformed_data[field_name], masking_rule)
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  RETURN transformed_data
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION apply_masking_rule(data, rule)
  // Implement masking methods (replace_with_x, partial_redaction, etc.)
  // based on the 'rule' parameter
  // Return the masked data
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Delegation Policy:**  (Existing structure + array of MaskingRules)
*   **MaskingRule:** `{field_name: string, condition: string, method: string, parameters: object}`
*   **Context:** `{user_role: string, location: string, time: datetime, device_type: string}`
