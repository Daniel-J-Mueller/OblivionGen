## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Composition

**System Overview:**

This system aims to dynamically compose acoustic scenes by layering synthesized and processed audio elements based on real-time analysis of microphone input, creating a richer and more immersive auditory experience. It expands beyond simple double-talk detection to *augment* the perceived audio environment.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Acoustic Feature Extraction:** Continuously analyze microphone input to identify dominant acoustic features (e.g., reverberation, noise floor, spectral centroid, harmonicity).  This leverages existing DSP techniques, but adds a dimensionality reduction step (PCA, t-SNE) to create a compact ‘acoustic fingerprint’.
2.  **Scene Library:** A pre-built library of synthesized/recorded audio ‘elements’ categorized by acoustic characteristics and ‘scene tags’ (e.g., “forest – gentle breeze”, “cafe – chatter, espresso machine”, “office – keyboard typing, muffled conversation”). Each element has associated metadata detailing its spectral profile, temporal characteristics, and spatialization cues.
3.  **Scene Composition Engine:** This is the core of the system. It takes the real-time acoustic fingerprint as input and queries the Scene Library for matching/complementary elements.  A weighted scoring system determines which elements to activate and blend. Weights are dynamically adjusted based on real-time acoustic analysis – if a scene is already “busy”, the engine favors quieter, more subtle elements.
4.  **Spatialization & Mixing:**  Utilize HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) based spatialization to position synthesized elements within a 3D soundscape.  Dynamic mixing algorithms (level balancing, EQ, compression) ensure that synthesized elements blend seamlessly with the live audio.
5.  **User Profiles:** Allow users to customize the system’s behavior, specifying preferred scene types, element intensities, and mixing styles.

**Pseudocode (Scene Composition Engine):**

```
// Input:  acoustic_fingerprint (vector), user_profile (data structure)
// Output:  element_list (list of active elements with mixing parameters)

function compose_scene(acoustic_fingerprint, user_profile):
    candidate_elements = query_scene_library(acoustic_fingerprint, user_profile) // Return elements matching fingerprint and profile
    scored_elements = []

    for element in candidate_elements:
        score = calculate_element_score(element, acoustic_fingerprint) // Score based on fingerprint similarity, user preference
        scored_elements.append((element, score))

    sorted_elements = sort_by_score(scored_elements) // Sort descending

    // Select top N elements (adjustable)
    selected_elements = sorted_elements[:N]

    // Adjust element levels based on system load & user preferences
    final_element_list = adjust_element_levels(selected_elements, system_load)

    return final_element_list
```
