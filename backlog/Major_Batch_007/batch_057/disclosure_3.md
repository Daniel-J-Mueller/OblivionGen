## Adaptive Workflow Decomposition & Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the workflow engine to not only *handle* errors and timeouts but proactively *decompose* workflows into smaller, independently verifiable sub-workflows based on predicted failure points. Couple this with a predictive model that learns from past executions to refine the decomposition and error handling strategies.

**Specifications:**

**1. Workflow Decomposition Service:**

   *   **Input:** Workflow Definition (as per the patent), Historical Execution Data (logs, performance metrics).
   *   **Process:**
        *   **Failure Point Prediction:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network trained on historical data) to identify potential failure points (tasks with high historical failure rates, long execution times, resource contention).
        *   **Decomposition Algorithm:** Based on predicted failure points, automatically decompose the workflow into smaller, independent sub-workflows. This decomposition respects data dependencies but minimizes the blast radius of potential failures.
        *   **Sub-Workflow Definition:** Generate definitions for each sub-workflow, including input/output data contracts, dependencies, and error handling policies.
        *   **Dependency Graph Generation:**  Create a dependency graph mapping the relationships between sub-workflows.
   *   **Output:** Decomposed Workflow (represented as a dependency graph of sub-workflows with defined contracts and error handling), Updated Workflow Definition.

**2. Predictive Error Handling Engine:**

   *   **Input:** Decomposed Workflow, Historical Execution Data, Real-time Execution Metrics.
   *   **Process:**
        *   **Real-time Risk Assessment:** Continuously monitor real-time execution metrics (CPU usage, memory allocation, network latency) and compare them against historical data. 
        *   **Dynamic Timeout/Heartbeat Adjustment:** Based on the risk assessment, dynamically adjust the timeout and heartbeat values for each sub-workflow. Higher risk = shorter timeouts/heartbeats.
        *   **Preemptive Retries:** If the risk assessment indicates a high probability of failure, preemptively retry a sub-workflow *before* it actually fails.
        *   **Adaptive Error Handling Strategies:** Employ different error handling strategies (retry, fallback, compensation) based on the type of error and the criticality of the sub-workflow.
   *   **Output:** Adjusted Workflow Parameters (timeouts, heartbeats, error handling policies), Error Handling Actions.

**3.  Workflow Verification Service:**

   *   **Input:**  Sub-workflow definitions, Input data, Expected outputs.
   *   **Process:**
        *   **Unit Testing:** Automatically generate and execute unit tests for each sub-workflow to verify its functionality.
        *   **Contract Verification:**  Verify that the input/output data contracts of each sub-workflow are consistent and valid.
        *   **Performance Testing:**  Measure the performance of each sub-workflow under different load conditions.
   *   **Output:** Verification Reports, Performance Metrics.

**Pseudocode (Workflow Decomposition Service):**

```
function decomposeWorkflow(workflowDefinition, historicalData) {
  // Train failure prediction model using historicalData
  predictionModel = trainModel(historicalData)

  // Identify potential failure points
  failurePoints = predictFailures(workflowDefinition, predictionModel)

  // Decompose workflow based on failure points
  subWorkflows = decompose(workflowDefinition, failurePoints)

  // Define contracts and error handling for each sub-workflow
  for each subWorkflow in subWorkflows {
    defineContract(subWorkflow)
    defineErrorHandler(subWorkflow)
  }

  return subWorkflows
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Workflow Definition:**  (Existing structure from the patent)
*   **Sub-Workflow Definition:** Includes input/output data contracts, dependencies, error handling policies, and verification tests.
*   **Risk Assessment Data:** Real-time execution metrics, historical performance data, predicted failure probabilities.
