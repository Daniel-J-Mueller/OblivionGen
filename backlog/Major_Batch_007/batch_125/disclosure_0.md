## Adaptive Feature Synthesis for CRF Models

**Concept:** Dynamically generate features for a CRF model *during inference* based on contextual information, rather than relying solely on pre-defined, static features. This addresses the limitations of fixed feature sets and allows the model to adapt to unseen data and nuanced linguistic patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Feature Synthesis Module:**

*   **Input:** Current word token, preceding *n* tokens, following *n* tokens, part-of-speech tags for all tokens within a window of *m* tokens.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a small, pre-trained language model (e.g., a distilled BERT or similar transformer) to generate contextual embeddings for each token within the input window.
    *   Apply a set of learnable transformation matrices (W1, W2, W3…) to the token embeddings. Each transformation matrix represents a potential feature ‘template.’
    *   Concatenate the transformed embeddings to form a synthesized feature vector.
    *   Pass the feature vector through a non-linear activation function (ReLU, tanh, etc.).
*   **Output:** Synthesized feature vector representing the current word’s context.

**2. CRF Integration:**

*   The synthesized feature vector is appended to the existing feature vector used by the CRF model.
*   The CRF model learns weights for the new synthesized features along with the existing static features.

**3. Training Procedure:**

*   **Phase 1: Static Feature Training:** Train the CRF model initially using only static features to establish a baseline.
*   **Phase 2: Synthesized Feature Training:** Freeze the weights of the static feature layers. Train *only* the weights associated with the synthesized features *and* the weights of the transformation matrices (W1, W2, W3…) within the Feature Synthesis Module.  This prevents catastrophic forgetting of the learned static features.
*   **Phase 3: Joint Fine-tuning (Optional):**  Unfreeze all weights and perform a final round of fine-tuning to allow for more nuanced interaction between static and synthesized features.

**4. System Architecture:**

```
[Input Sentence] --> [Tokenization & POS Tagging] --> [Feature Synthesis Module] --> [CRF Model] --> [Output Label Sequence]
                                                                      ^
                                                                      |
                                                                      [Static Feature Extraction]
```

**5. Pseudocode - Feature Synthesis Module:**

```python
def synthesize_features(tokens, pos_tags):
    embeddings = pre_trained_lm(tokens) # Get contextual embeddings

    synthesized_features = []
    for i in range(len(tokens)):
        embedding = embeddings[i]

        # Apply transformation matrices
        feature1 = np.dot(embedding, W1)
        feature2 = np.dot(embedding, W2)
        # ... more features

        # Concatenate and apply activation
        combined_features = np.concatenate([feature1, feature2])
        activated_features = activation_function(combined_features)

        synthesized_features.append(activated_features)

    return synthesized_features
```

**6. Parameterization:**

*   **W1, W2, W3…:** Learnable transformation matrices (size determined by embedding dimension and desired feature dimension).
*   **Activation Function:** ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, etc.
*   **Context Window Size (n):** Number of preceding and following tokens to consider.
*   **POS Tag Embedding Dimension:** Dimension of the POS tag embeddings (if POS tags are used as input).
*   **Pre-trained Language Model:** Selection of pre-trained language model (e.g., DistilBERT, TinyBERT).
