## Dynamic Resource Isolation with Ephemeral Role Creation

**Concept:** Extend the temporary resource access model to include dynamically created, ephemeral roles tied to the lifespan of a software product instance. This allows for fine-grained, just-in-time access control, enhancing security and resource management.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Role Broker Service:** A new service within the service provider network responsible for creating, managing, and destroying ephemeral roles.
*   **Policy Extension:** The existing access policy framework is extended to allow third-party software providers to *request* role creation based on defined templates or specifications.  These requests would be validated against resource availability and pre-defined security constraints.
*   **Credential Mapping:**  A mechanism to securely map the ephemeral role to credentials usable by the software product instance.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Request Initiation:** When a customer requests execution of a software product, the service provider network forwards a role creation request (embedded within the software product execution request) to the Role Broker Service. This request includes:
    *   Software product identifier
    *   Requested role template/specification (defined by the third-party provider)
    *   Requested duration/lifespan of the role
    *   Resources the role requires access to (identified by resource ID or type)
2.  **Role Creation & Validation:** The Role Broker Service:
    *   Validates the request against available resources and security policies.
    *   Creates a new, ephemeral role.  This role has a unique identifier and a defined lifespan.
    *   Associates the role with the software product instance.
3.  **Credential Generation:** The Role Broker Service generates temporary credentials (e.g., short-lived tokens) associated with the ephemeral role. These credentials grant the software product instance access to the requested resources.
4.  **Credential Delivery:** The temporary credentials are securely delivered to the software product instance.
5.  **Resource Access:** The software product instance uses the temporary credentials to access the requested resources.
6.  **Role Expiration:**  When the software product instance terminates or the specified lifespan expires:
    *   The Role Broker Service automatically revokes the temporary credentials.
    *   The ephemeral role is destroyed.

**3. Pseudocode (Role Broker Service - Role Creation):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION CreateEphemeralRole(softwareProductID, roleTemplate, duration, requiredResources):
  // 1. Validate request against security policies & resource availability
  IF ValidateRequest(softwareProductID, roleTemplate, requiredResources) == FALSE:
    RETURN ERROR // Request invalid

  // 2. Create new ephemeral role
  roleID = GenerateUniqueID()
  role = {
    "id": roleID,
    "softwareProductID": softwareProductID,
    "template": roleTemplate,
    "resources": requiredResources,
    "expirationTime": CurrentTime() + duration
  }

  // 3. Generate temporary credentials
  credentials = GenerateCredentials(role)

  // 4. Store role metadata (for auditing and revocation)
  StoreRoleMetadata(role, credentials)

  RETURN credentials
```

**4.  API Endpoints (Example):**

*   `/rolebroker/create` (POST): Creates an ephemeral role.  Request body includes software product ID, role template, duration, and required resources. Returns generated credentials.
*   `/rolebroker/revoke/{roleID}` (POST): Revokes an ephemeral role and its associated credentials.

**5.  Security Considerations:**

*   Role templates should be carefully validated to prevent privilege escalation.
*   Credentials should be short-lived and securely transmitted.
*   Auditing should be implemented to track role creation, access, and revocation.
*   Resource access policies should be granular and restrict access to only the necessary resources.
