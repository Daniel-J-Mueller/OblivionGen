## Adaptive Shard Migration Based on Secondary Index Query Patterns

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This design introduces a system for dynamically migrating shards within a distributed non-relational database based on real-time analysis of query patterns *specifically targeting secondary indexes*. The goal is to optimize read latency and resource utilization by co-locating frequently queried data across shards.

**II. Components:**

*   **Query Pattern Analyzer (QPA):** A component that intercepts and analyzes incoming queries. It extracts information about:
    *   Secondary indexes used in the query.
    *   Key ranges specified in the query (targeting specific index values).
    *   Frequency of queries targeting specific index key ranges.
    *   Shard ID where the initial query resolution occurred.
*   **Shard Affinity Map (SAM):** A distributed data structure that maintains a mapping between index key ranges and preferred shards.  This map is updated by the QPA. The SAM is designed for high read/write concurrency.
*   **Shard Migration Manager (SMM):** A component responsible for initiating and managing shard migrations. It receives signals from the QPA and SAM indicating potential optimization opportunities.
*   **Data Rebalancing Engine (DRE):** The underlying mechanism for physically moving data between shards. This could leverage existing data replication and consistency protocols.

**III. Workflow:**

1.  **Query Interception:** The QPA intercepts incoming queries that utilize secondary indexes.
2.  **Pattern Analysis:** The QPA analyzes the query to identify the secondary index used, the key range targeted, and the query frequency.
3.  **SAM Update:** The QPA updates the SAM with the observed query pattern.  The SAM entry for the index key range is adjusted based on the frequency of queries originating from or targeting a specific shard.
4.  **Migration Trigger:** The SMM periodically scans the SAM. If the SMM detects a significant discrepancy between the current shard distribution and the SAM (i.e., a key range is frequently accessed from a shard where it's not primarily located), it initiates a shard migration request.
5.  **Data Rebalancing:** The DRE initiates a background data rebalancing operation to move data associated with the targeted key range to the preferred shard.  This is done incrementally to minimize impact on ongoing operations.
6.  **SAM Synchronization:**  After the data migration is complete, the SAM is updated to reflect the new shard distribution.

**IV. Pseudocode (SMM - Migration Decision Logic):**

```
function decide_migration(sam, threshold):
  for each key_range in sam:
    preferred_shard = sam[key_range].preferred_shard
    current_shard = sam[key_range].current_shard

    if preferred_shard != current_shard:
      access_frequency_diff = sam[key_range].access_frequency[preferred_shard] - sam[key_range].access_frequency[current_shard]
      if abs(access_frequency_diff) > threshold:
        migration_request = create_migration_request(key_range, current_shard, preferred_shard)
        return migration_request
  return null // No migration needed
```

**V. Data Structures:**

*   **SAM Entry:**
    *   `key_range`: The range of values for the indexed attribute.
    *   `preferred_shard`: The shard ID where data for this key range should reside.
    *   `current_shard`: The current shard where data for this key range is located.
    *   `access_frequency`: A map of shard IDs to query access counts for this key range.

**VI. Considerations:**

*   **Threshold Tuning:** The `threshold` parameter in the migration decision logic needs to be carefully tuned to balance optimization benefits with migration overhead.
*   **Migration Consistency:** Data consistency during migration is critical. Leveraging existing replication and consistency mechanisms is crucial.
*   **Warm-up Period:** A warm-up period for the QPA is needed to collect sufficient data before initiating migrations.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:**  Comprehensive monitoring and alerting are needed to track migration progress and identify potential issues.
