## Acoustic Event “Painting” for Spatial Awareness

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple presence detection to create a dynamic, spatially-aware “acoustic painting” of an environment. Utilize multiple microphones and advanced signal processing to not only detect *what* sounds are present, but *where* they originate, constructing a real-time auditory map.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum of 8 microphones arranged in a spherical or semi-spherical configuration. Calibration data for each microphone’s precise location is essential.
*   **Beamforming:** Implement adaptive beamforming algorithms. Shift the focus of the microphone array to pinpoint sound sources. Focus on techniques allowing for multiple simultaneous beams.
*   **Acoustic Event Library:** Expand beyond speech and animal sounds. Create a comprehensive library of acoustic events (e.g., footsteps, door slams, running water, specific appliance sounds, breaking glass) with associated acoustic signatures.
*   **Sound Source Localization:** Implement Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and/or Angle of Arrival (AoA) algorithms. Fuse the data with beamforming output. Refine algorithms to compensate for reverberation and multi-path effects.
*   **“Acoustic Painting” Representation:** Represent the environment as a 3D grid or point cloud. Assign each grid cell/point a color and intensity based on detected acoustic event(s) and their estimated location/intensity. This generates a visualization where sounds *appear* to emanate from their source. For example, a door slam would briefly illuminate the grid cell corresponding to the door's location with a bright flash of color.
*   **Event Persistence/Decay:** Implement a decay function for each detected event. The visualization should not be static. Events fade over time, mimicking the natural persistence of sound.
*   **Confidence Mapping:** Include a confidence score for each localized event, visually represented by transparency or color saturation. This indicates the system’s certainty about the source location.
*   **Layered Visualization:** Allow layering of different acoustic events. This provides a richer, more detailed auditory map. For example, speech could be visualized as a continuous glow, while short, transient events (e.g., footsteps) are represented by momentary flashes.
*   **AI-Driven Event Recognition:** Integrate a deep learning model trained to classify complex sounds. The model should be able to recognize sounds not explicitly present in the initial library, enabling the system to adapt to new environments and soundscapes.
*   **Data Output:** Output the acoustic painting data in a standard format (e.g., point cloud data, volumetric data) for integration with other applications (e.g., smart home systems, security systems, augmented reality interfaces).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize microphone array and calibration data

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Capture audio data from all microphones
  audioData = captureAudio()

  // Perform beamforming
  beamformedData = performBeamforming(audioData)

  // Localize sound sources
  soundSources = localizeSoundSources(beamformedData)

  // Classify acoustic events
  events = classifyEvents(soundSources)

  // Create acoustic painting representation
  painting = createAcousticPainting(events)

  // Output painting data
  outputPaintingData(painting)

  // Sleep for a short period
  sleep(0.01)
}
```

This system moves beyond simply detecting *if* someone is present to creating a dynamic, spatial understanding of the surrounding environment, opening doors for advanced applications in security, automation, and accessibility.
