## Dynamic Content Anchoring via Perceptual Hashing

**Concept:** Extend invariant location referencing to encompass not just byte-level positional data, but *perceptual* characteristics of content. This allows for referencing and navigation even when content is dynamically altered – re-flowed, edited, or even partially regenerated – as the invariant reference isn’t tied to a specific byte position but to what the content *looks* like.

**Specs:**

1.  **Perceptual Hash Generation:**
    *   Implement a perceptual hashing algorithm (e.g., pHash, dHash, aHash) tailored for the specific content type (text, images, charts, etc.).  The algorithm should generate a compact hash value representing the visual 'fingerprint' of the content.
    *   For text, the algorithm should consider font, size, style, and line breaks during hash generation.  Image hashes will be standard visual hashes.  Charts and tables require a rasterization step *before* hashing.
    *   Hashing should occur in real-time as content is displayed or modified.

2.  **Invariant Reference Identifier (IRI) Structure:**
    *   IRI = `[Content Type]-[Perceptual Hash]-[Timestamp]`
    *   `Content Type`: A string indicating the type of content being referenced (e.g., "text", "image", "chart").
    *   `Perceptual Hash`: The compact hash value generated by the perceptual hashing algorithm.
    *   `Timestamp`: A high-resolution timestamp to differentiate identical hashes generated at different times.  This handles dynamic content updates.

3.  **Navigation Pane Integration:**
    *   Display a list of IRIs in a navigation pane.
    *   Each IRI should be associated with a visual thumbnail of the corresponding content.
    *   Selection of an IRI should trigger a search for content matching the `Perceptual Hash`.  The search should prioritize results closest in `Timestamp`.

4.  **Content Matching Algorithm:**
    *   Implement a fuzzy matching algorithm that allows for slight variations in content while still identifying the correct section.
    *   This is critical for handling minor re-flows or edits.  The algorithm should compare the perceptual hash of the displayed content with the target hash.
    *   A similarity threshold should be configurable.

5.  **Dynamic Content Update Handling:**
    *   When content is modified, the perceptual hash is recalculated.
    *   The system should intelligently update the navigation pane and existing IRIs to reflect the changes.
    *   A versioning system may be implemented to track historical versions of content and their associated IRIs.

**Pseudocode (Search Function):**

```
function search_by_iri(target_iri):
  target_hash = extract_hash_from_iri(target_iri)
  candidate_sections = get_all_displayed_sections() // Array of visual content sections
  best_match = null
  highest_similarity = 0

  for section in candidate_sections:
    section_hash = generate_perceptual_hash(section)
    similarity = compare_hashes(section_hash, target_hash)

    if similarity > highest_similarity:
      highest_similarity = similarity
      best_match = section

  if highest_similarity >= similarity_threshold:
    display_section(best_match)
  else:
    display_error("No matching content found")
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond simple byte-positioning to create a content-aware navigation system that is robust to dynamic content alterations.  It provides a more intuitive and reliable way to navigate large and complex digital documents.  A key differentiator is the *combination* of perceptual hashing with a timestamp for finer-grained content identification.
