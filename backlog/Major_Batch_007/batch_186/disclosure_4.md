## Data Source ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Metadata

**Concept:** Extend the metadata catalog to proactively ‘shadow’ data sources, not just catalog them. This involves continuous, lightweight data profiling and schema inference *at the source*, with the inferred metadata automatically updating the central catalog.  Crucially, incorporate predictive metadata based on historical data access patterns and machine learning.

**Specs:**

1.  **Shadowing Agent:** A lightweight agent deployed near (or as part of) each registered data source.
    *   **Function:**  Continuously sample data from the source (configurable sampling rate/volume).
    *   **Schema Inference:** Utilize statistical methods and machine learning to infer schema (data types, constraints, relationships) even with schemaless or semi-structured data.
    *   **Data Profiling:** Track basic statistics (min, max, average, null counts, distinct values) for each column/field.
    *   **Change Detection:** Monitor for schema drift or data quality anomalies.
    *   **Communication:** Transmit aggregated profiling & schema updates to the central metadata catalog via a secure channel (gRPC preferred).

2.  **Predictive Metadata Engine:**  A component within the central metadata catalog.
    *   **Historical Access Log:** Maintain a record of all data access requests (user, data source, fields accessed, filters applied).
    *   **Pattern Identification:**  Utilize machine learning (e.g., association rule mining, time series analysis) to identify common data access patterns.
    *   **Predictive Schema/Field Ranking:**  Rank fields/columns based on predicted likelihood of future access.  This allows data consumers to prioritize data loading/processing.
    *   **Predictive Filtering:** Suggest likely filter values based on historical usage.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual access patterns that may indicate data quality issues or security threats.

3.  **Catalog API Extensions:**
    *   `GET /data_source/{id}/predictive_fields`: Returns a ranked list of predicted frequently accessed fields.
    *   `GET /data_source/{id}/suggested_filters/{field}`: Returns a list of suggested filter values for a given field.
    *   `GET /data_source/{id}/shadow_status`: Returns the status of the shadowing agent (active, inactive, error).

**Pseudocode (Predictive Filtering Suggestion):**

```
function suggest_filters(data_source_id, field_name):
  // Retrieve historical access logs for the data source and field
  logs = get_historical_access_logs(data_source_id, field_name)

  // Extract filter values from the logs
  filter_values = extract_filter_values(logs)

  // Calculate frequency of each filter value
  value_counts = calculate_value_counts(filter_values)

  // Sort filter values by frequency (descending)
  sorted_values = sort_by_frequency(value_counts)

  // Return top N most frequent filter values
  return sorted_values[:10] // Return top 10 suggested filters
```

**Rationale:**

This goes beyond simple metadata cataloging. Proactive shadowing provides more accurate and up-to-date metadata, while predictive metadata empowers data consumers to discover and access data more efficiently.  The combination unlocks a "smart" data catalog that adapts to changing data landscapes and user behavior. This could drastically improve data analytics workflows.
