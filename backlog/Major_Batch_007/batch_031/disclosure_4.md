## Dynamic Floor Tile Network - Acoustic Mapping & Localization

**System Overview:** Integrate miniature, high-frequency acoustic transducers into each smart floor tile. These transducers will emit and receive ultrasonic pulses. By analyzing the Time-of-Flight (ToF) and intensity of these pulses, a real-time acoustic map of the space will be generated. This map will be used for precise object and person localization, even in the absence of visual data.

**Tile Specifications:**

*   **Transducers:** 8 miniature (5mm diameter) ultrasonic transducers per tile, arranged in a circular pattern. Frequency: 40kHz - 80kHz. Sensitivity: -60dB.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated low-power DSP within each tile to handle acoustic signal processing (filtering, FFT, ToF calculation).
*   **Communication:** Existing communication interface (as per patent) expanded to transmit acoustic data (ToF values, signal strengths) alongside tile identifier and electrical characteristics.
*   **Power:** Existing power infrastructure supplemented with low-voltage power supplies for transducers and DSP.
*   **Physical:**  Tile dimensions remain consistent with existing design. Transducers are flush-mounted to avoid impact or interference.

**Server-Side Processing:**

*   **Acoustic Map Construction:** Server receives ToF and signal strength data from all tiles.
*   Algorithm: Multi-lateration using ToF data to pinpoint object locations. Signal strength used to refine accuracy and differentiate multiple objects.
*   Dynamic Map: The acoustic map is continuously updated as objects move. The map stores object positions, velocities, and sizes (estimated from signal footprint).
*   Data Fusion: Integrate acoustic data with existing data streams (electrical characteristics of tiles, potentially camera data) for enhanced tracking.
*   Zone Definition:  Allow users to define virtual zones within the space. The system will automatically track the number of people/objects within each zone.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side â€“ Object Localization):**

```
function localizeObject(tileDataArray):
  objectPositions = []

  for each tileData in tileDataArray:
    tileID = tileData.tileID
    distances = tileData.distances  // Array of distances to potential object from tile
    signalStrengths = tileData.signalStrengths // Array of signal strengths

    for i in range(len(distances)):
      if distances[i] > 0: //Valid Distance
        //Triangulate position using at least 3 tiles
        if len(valid_tiles) >= 3:
           position = triangulate(valid_tiles, distances)
           objectPositions.append(position)
  
  // Filter and average object positions for greater accuracy
  filtered_positions = filterOutliers(objectPositions)
  average_position = calculateAverage(filtered_positions)
  return average_position
```

**Novelty:**  Existing smart floor systems focus primarily on location via electrical characteristics or basic pressure sensing. Adding acoustic mapping unlocks a new dimension of precision and detail, enabling object tracking in visually obscured environments. The integrated DSP on each tile minimizes server processing load and reduces latency. This expands utility into warehouse automation, assisted living, and security systems.
