## Adaptive Model Splitting & Collaborative Edge Inference

**Concept:** Extend the idea of optimizing models for edge devices by *dynamically* splitting a model across multiple edge devices *during* inference, based on real-time resource availability and network conditions.  This isn’t static partitioning; it’s a collaborative, fluid distribution of computational load.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Central Coordinator:** A server component responsible for model storage, initial partitioning strategies, and dynamic load balancing.
*   **Edge Agent:** Software running on each edge device.  Handles local model execution, resource monitoring (CPU, GPU, memory, bandwidth), and communication with the Central Coordinator.
*   **Model Repository:** Stores base models and dynamically generated partitions.

**2.  Dynamic Partitioning Algorithm:**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION calculate_optimal_partition(model, edge_devices, network_conditions):
    // edge_devices is a list of EdgeAgent objects with resource data
    // network_conditions represents latency/bandwidth between devices & coordinator
    
    partitions = generate_initial_partitions(model) // E.g., layer-wise split
    
    WHILE optimization_needed():
        FOR each layer in partitions:
            candidate_devices = find_devices_with_sufficient_resources(layer, edge_devices)
            
            IF candidate_devices is empty:
                //Attempt to offload layers to coordinator or more powerful edge device
                continue
            
            best_device = select_best_device(best_device, layer, candidate_devices, network_conditions)
            
            // Calculate cost (latency, bandwidth, energy) of running layer on device
            cost = calculate_cost(layer, best_device, network_conditions)
            
            IF cost < current_cost:
                move_layer_to_device(layer, best_device)
                current_cost = cost

        IF no improvement after iteration:
            break

    RETURN partitions
```

**3.  Communication Protocol:**

*   **gRPC with Protocol Buffers:** For efficient, bidirectional communication between the Central Coordinator and Edge Agents.
*   **Message Types:**
    *   `ModelPartitionRequest`: Request for a specific model partition.
    *   `ResourceReport`: Edge Agent reports available resources.
    *   `InferenceRequest`: Client sends inference data to the system.
    *   `PartialResult`:  Edge device sends a partial inference result.
    *   `FinalResult`: The Central Coordinator assembles and returns the final inference result.

**4. Inference Flow:**

1.  Client sends `InferenceRequest` to Central Coordinator.
2.  Central Coordinator determines optimal model partitioning based on `ResourceReports` and network conditions.
3.  Central Coordinator distributes model partitions to Edge Agents.
4.  Edge Agents execute their assigned partitions and send `PartialResult` back to Central Coordinator.
5.  Central Coordinator assembles the `FinalResult` and returns to the client.

**5. Adaptive Mechanism:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:**  Edge Agents continuously monitor resource usage and report to the Central Coordinator.
*   **Re-partitioning Trigger:**  If resource usage exceeds a threshold or network conditions change significantly, the Central Coordinator initiates a re-partitioning process.
*   **Cost Function:** Cost function considers latency, bandwidth, energy consumption, and computational load.  Optimizes for minimal overall cost.



This system allows for flexible and efficient inference, leveraging the collective resources of multiple edge devices. The dynamic re-partitioning ensures optimal performance even in changing environments, exceeding the capabilities of static model optimization.
