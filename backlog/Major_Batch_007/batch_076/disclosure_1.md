## Adaptive Granularity Indexing with Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the existing rollback mechanism by dynamically adjusting index granularity based on observed data volatility and query patterns. Introduce a predictive rollback system that anticipates potential data corruption and proactively prepares rollback points.

**Specifications:**

**1. Volatility Monitoring Module:**

*   **Data Source:** Metrics data stream (as in the provided patent) and query logs.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Data Change Rate:** Rate of change for individual metrics and aggregated metrics. Calculated as the number of updates/inserts per time window.
    *   **Query Frequency:** Number of queries accessing specific metrics or data segments.
    *   **Query Error Rate:** Number of queries returning errors or stale data.
*   **Output:** Volatility Score for each metric/data segment.  Higher score indicates higher volatility.

**2. Dynamic Granularity Adjustment Module:**

*   **Input:** Volatility Score, Query Frequency.
*   **Granularity Levels:**
    *   **Fine-Grained:**  Individual metric level indexing. (High cost, fast access)
    *   **Medium-Grained:**  Aggregated metric level indexing (e.g., average CPU utilization per server). (Medium cost, medium access)
    *   **Coarse-Grained:**  Broad data segment level indexing (e.g., all metrics for a specific time range). (Low cost, slow access)
*   **Logic:**
    *   If Volatility Score > Threshold_High AND Query Frequency > Threshold_High: Use Fine-Grained indexing.
    *   If Volatility Score > Threshold_Medium OR Query Frequency > Threshold_Medium: Use Medium-Grained indexing.
    *   Otherwise: Use Coarse-Grained indexing.
*   **Implementation:**  Index restructuring happens asynchronously in the background.  New index version is activated after completion and verification.

**3. Predictive Rollback Module:**

*   **Input:** Metrics data stream, Volatility Score, historical corruption patterns (learned over time).
*   **Logic:**
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor metrics data for anomalies indicating potential corruption.
    *   **Rollback Point Selection:** Proactively select rollback points based on anomaly scores and data volatility.  Rather than waiting for corruption, pre-compute a "shadow" index.
    *   **Shadow Index Creation:**  Create a near real-time “shadow” index reflecting the state of the data at the selected rollback point.  This is done in parallel with ongoing data processing.  Delta-based compression is used to minimize storage overhead.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Store shadow indices in a separate, highly available storage tier.
    *   Implement a fast switchover mechanism to activate the shadow index in case of corruption.

**4. Enhanced Index Management:**

*   **Index Versioning:** Maintain multiple index versions (active, shadow, historical).
*   **Index Compaction:** Regularly compact historical index versions to reduce storage overhead.
*   **Index Repair:** Implement automated index repair mechanisms to detect and fix corrupted index entries.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Rollback):**

```
function monitor_data_stream(data_stream):
  anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(data_stream)
  volatility_score = calculate_volatility_score(data_stream)

  if anomaly_score > threshold_high or volatility_score > threshold_high:
    select_rollback_point()
    create_shadow_index(selected_rollback_point)
    store_shadow_index()

function create_shadow_index(rollback_point):
  // Delta-based index creation from rollback_point
  // Parallel processing to minimize impact on live data processing

function store_shadow_index():
  // Store shadow index in highly available storage
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Volatility Score Table:** Stores volatility score for each metric/data segment.
*   **Shadow Index Table:**  Stores metadata about shadow indices (rollback point, creation time, storage location).
