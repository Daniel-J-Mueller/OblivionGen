## Personalized "Assistant Moods" & Dynamic Skill Prioritization

**Concept:** Extend the multi-assistant framework to incorporate nuanced "moods" for each assistant, influencing not just voice style, but also skill prioritization and response complexity. These moods would be dynamically adjusted based on user biometrics & contextual data, creating a truly personalized & adaptive experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Mood Definition & Parameterization:**

*   Each CPS (Command Processing Subsystem, representing an assistant) will have a defined set of moods (e.g., Energetic, Calm, Playful, Informative, Empathetic).
*   Each mood will be parameterized by:
    *   *Voice Style*: Existing capability.
    *   *Response Verbosity*: Scale of 1-10, controlling detail level.
    *   *Skill Weightings*:  Adjustable weights (0-100) for each available skill, defining prioritization within that mood.  (e.g., "Energetic" mood boosts music and news skills, while "Calm" boosts meditation and ambient sound skills).
    *   *Proactive Suggestion Probability*: Probability of offering suggestions beyond the direct command, influenced by mood. (e.g., “Playful” suggests games, “Informative” suggests related facts.)
    *   *Error Handling Style*: Defines how the assistant responds to errors or ambiguous commands.  (e.g., “Empathetic” offers helpful rephrasing suggestions, “Playful” responds with a lighthearted joke).

**2. Biometric & Contextual Input:**

*   Integrate with wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness trackers) to capture biometric data: heart rate, skin conductance, body temperature, sleep patterns.
*   Utilize device sensors: ambient light, noise levels, location, time of day, calendar events.
*   Analyze user speech: tone, pacing, emotional content.

**3. Dynamic Mood Selection Algorithm:**

```pseudocode
function determineAssistantMood(biometricData, contextualData, userSpeechAnalysis):
  moodScores = {}
  // Calculate scores for each mood based on inputs
  for each mood in availableMoods:
    score = 0
    // Biometric Score
    if heartRate > thresholdHigh:
      score += mood.energyWeight * 0.5  // Boost energetic moods
    elif heartRate < thresholdLow:
      score += mood.calmWeight * 0.5   // Boost calm moods
    // Contextual Score
    if timeOfDay == "morning":
      score += mood.energyWeight * 0.3
    if location == "home" and noiseLevel == "low":
      score += mood.calmWeight * 0.4
    // Speech Analysis
    if speechTone == "stressed":
      score += mood.empatheticWeight * 0.6
    // Total Score
    moodScores[mood] = score

  // Select mood with highest score
  selectedMood = max(moodScores)
  return selectedMood
```

**4. Skill Prioritization & Response Generation:**

*   Based on the selected mood, adjust the skill weightings in the CPS.
*   When processing a command, the NLU system considers the weighted skills to determine the most relevant response.
*   The response generation system adjusts verbosity and style based on the mood parameters.

**5.  Adaptive Learning:**

*   Track user interactions (explicit feedback, implicit behavior) to refine the mood selection algorithm and skill weightings.
*   Implement a reinforcement learning model to optimize mood selection based on user satisfaction.



**Engineering Notes:**

*   The system will require a robust data pipeline for collecting and processing biometric and contextual data.
*   The mood selection algorithm should be computationally efficient to ensure real-time responsiveness.
*   A user interface will be needed to allow users to customize mood settings and provide feedback.
*   Privacy considerations are paramount; biometric data should be anonymized and securely stored.
