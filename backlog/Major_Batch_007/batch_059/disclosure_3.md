## Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Spatial Audio Mapping

**Core Concept:** Extend the directional audio output described in the patent to create dynamically adjustable “acoustic zones” within a room, personalized to individual users and/or activity. This moves beyond simply directing sound *away* from the microphone; it sculpts the soundscape.

**I. Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Microphone Array:** A circular array of at least 16 high-sensitivity microphones positioned at the top housing surface. Beamforming algorithms will leverage this array for precise source localization and noise cancellation.
*   **Speaker Array:**  A phased array of miniature, full-range speakers integrated into the base of the cylindrical housing. Minimum 32 speakers, capable of individual amplitude and phase control.
*   **Ultrasonic Proximity Sensors:** Four ultrasonic sensors positioned around the circumference of the housing at mid-height. These detect the presence and approximate distance of users within the room.  Range: 0.5m – 5m.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):**  A 9-axis IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) embedded within the housing. Used for orientation awareness and dynamic adjustments to acoustic zones.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance System on a Chip (SoC) with dedicated audio processing and AI acceleration capabilities. Minimum 8 cores, 16GB RAM.
*   **Network Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3.

**II. Software & Algorithm Specifications:**

*   **Real-time Spatial Mapping:**  Using microphone array data and IMU data, the device creates a real-time 3D map of the room, identifying walls, furniture, and user locations.
*   **User Identification & Profiling:**  Utilizing voice recognition (separate from speech commands) and potentially facial recognition (optional camera integration), the system identifies individual users and loads their preferred audio profiles (EQ settings, volume levels, preferred content sources).
*   **Acoustic Zone Generation:**
    *   Algorithm dynamically creates cylindrical “acoustic zones” around identified users.
    *   Zone size adjustable based on user preference and proximity to other users/objects.
    *   Each zone receives tailored audio content, volume levels, and spatialization.
*   **Beamforming & Phase Array Control:**
    *   Advanced beamforming algorithms focus audio output *within* designated acoustic zones.
    *   Phase array control precisely directs sound waves, minimizing spillover to other zones.
    *   Algorithm compensates for room acoustics (reflections, absorption) to optimize audio clarity.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   Ultrasonic sensors trigger adjustments to acoustic zones when users move.
    *   IMU data adapts zone orientation to user head movements.
    *   Algorithm monitors audio feedback (using microphones) to fine-tune beamforming and phase array control.
*   **Content Prioritization:** Algorithm prioritizes audio content based on identified user and zone. For instance, one zone might receive music, while another receives a podcast, and a third remains silent.
*   **"Whisper Mode":** Ability to create a highly localized audio zone for private conversations, even in noisy environments. Achieved through extreme beamforming and noise cancellation.

**III. Pseudocode - Zone Adjustment Loop:**

```pseudocode
loop:
  getUserLocations() // Utilizing Ultrasonic Sensors & Voice Tracking
  updateSpatialMap() // Create 3D map of room based on sensor data

  for each user in userList:
    createAcousticZone(user.location, user.preferences.zoneSize)
    setZoneAudioSource(user.preferences.audioSource)
    setZoneVolume(user.preferences.volumeLevel)
    adjustBeamforming(user.location) // Calculate beamforming weights
    controlPhaseArray(user.location) // Calculate phase array settings

  monitorAudioFeedback() // Analyze microphone input for adjustments
  adjustBeamformingAndPhaseArrayBasedOnFeedback()

  delay(0.05 seconds) // Refresh loop every 20ms
end loop
```

**IV. Potential Applications:**

*   **Open-Plan Offices:**  Create private audio zones for individual employees.
*   **Home Entertainment:**  Personalized audio experiences for each family member.
*   **Gaming:** Immersive spatial audio for a more realistic gaming experience.
*   **Accessibility:**  Assistive listening device for individuals with hearing impairments.
