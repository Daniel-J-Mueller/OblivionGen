## Automated Hyperparameter Optimization via Evolutionary Strategies within Containerized ML Pipelines

**Specification:** A system for automating hyperparameter optimization of machine learning models within the containerized framework described in patent 11550614, leveraging evolutionary strategies (ES) and a distributed execution architecture.

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing containerized ML pipeline to incorporate a self-optimizing component. Instead of relying on manually defined or grid/random search-based hyperparameter tuning, the system will use ES to evolve a population of model configurations. This allows for more efficient exploration of the hyperparameter space, especially in high-dimensional settings.

**Components:**

1.  **ES Controller:** A central service responsible for managing the ES population, evaluating model performance, and generating new configurations.
2.  **Worker Pool:** A cluster of compute resources (virtual machines, Kubernetes pods) capable of running containerized ML training jobs.
3.  **Containerized ML Job:** The standard ML training container as defined in the source patent, modified to accept a configuration dictionary as input.
4.  **Evaluation Service:**  A service to evaluate the performance of models, possibly using a validation dataset or A/B testing.
5.  **Configuration Encoding:** A method to encode hyperparameter values into a vector representation suitable for ES algorithms.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initialization:** The ES Controller initializes a population of random hyperparameter configurations, encoding each as a vector.
2.  **Job Submission:** For each configuration in the population, the Controller submits a containerized ML training job to the Worker Pool.  The job accepts the configuration vector as an environment variable or command-line argument.
3.  **Training & Evaluation:** Each worker executes the containerized ML job using the provided configuration. The trained model is then sent to the Evaluation Service, which returns a performance score (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).
4.  **Population Update:** The ES Controller receives the performance scores from the Evaluation Service. It uses these scores to update the population via mutation and selection.  Elite individuals are preserved, while others are mutated to explore new configurations.
5.  **Iteration:** Steps 2-4 are repeated for a predefined number of generations or until a satisfactory performance threshold is reached.

**Pseudocode (ES Controller - Population Update):**

```python
def update_population(population, scores, mutation_rate, elite_size):
  """
  Updates the population based on scores, mutation rate, and elite size.

  Args:
    population: List of hyperparameter configuration vectors.
    scores: List of corresponding performance scores.
    mutation_rate: Probability of mutating a hyperparameter value.
    elite_size: Number of top-performing individuals to preserve.

  Returns:
    Updated population.
  """

  # Sort population by score (descending)
  sorted_population = sorted(zip(population, scores), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  population, scores = zip(*sorted_population)

  # Preserve elite individuals
  elite_population = population[:elite_size]
  elite_scores = scores[:elite_size]

  # Mutate remaining individuals
  mutated_population = []
  for i in range(elite_size, len(population)):
    individual = list(population[i]) # Convert to mutable list
    for j in range(len(individual)):
      if random.random() < mutation_rate:
        # Apply a small random change to the hyperparameter value
        individual[j] += random.gauss(0, 0.1) # Example: Gaussian mutation
    mutated_population.append(tuple(individual)) # Convert back to tuple

  return elite_population + mutated_population
```

**Novelty:**

This system combines the containerized ML pipeline with evolutionary strategies for automated hyperparameter optimization. This allows for a more efficient and flexible approach to model tuning, especially in complex scenarios.  The distributed architecture enables scaling the optimization process to handle large datasets and complex models. The combination of containerization and ES offers significant benefits in terms of reproducibility, portability, and scalability.
