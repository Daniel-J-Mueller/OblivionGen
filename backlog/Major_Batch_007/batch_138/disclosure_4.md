## Adaptive Buffer Cache Granularity

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on a distributed, in-memory buffer cache. This design proposes *dynamically adjusting* the granularity of caching – the size of data blocks stored in the cache – based on access patterns. Instead of a fixed block size, the system would adaptively coalesce or fragment data within the cache to optimize hit rates and reduce latency.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Granularity Unit (DGU):**  The fundamental unit of data managed in the cache. Initially, this might correspond to a standard page size (e.g., 4KB).
*   **Granularity Manager (GM):** A dedicated component responsible for monitoring access patterns and adjusting DGU size. It operates independently on each buffer cache node.
*   **Access Pattern Monitoring:** GM continuously tracks read/write requests, identifying frequently co-accessed data.  Metrics include:
    *   Temporal locality (accesses within a short time window)
    *   Spatial locality (accesses to nearby data locations)
    *   Request frequency
*   **Coalescence Trigger:** When spatial/temporal locality exceeds a threshold, GM initiates a coalescence operation. This involves merging adjacent DGUs into a larger DGU.
*   **Fragmentation Trigger:** When DGU access frequency drops below a threshold, GM initiates a fragmentation operation, splitting a large DGU into smaller ones.
*   **Dynamic Metadata:** Each DGU entry includes metadata indicating:
    *   Current size
    *   Fragmentation/Coalescence history
    *   Access frequency statistics
*   **Adaptive Hashing:**  The caching hash table must support dynamic DGU sizes.  A variable-size hashing scheme is required to accommodate fragmentation and coalescence without significant overhead.
*   **Write Propagation Strategy:**  When a DGU is fragmented, writes must be propagated to all affected fragments. Coalesced DGUs require a merging of write intents.
*   **DGU Swapping Algorithm:** The memory manager must adapt to variable DGU sizes during eviction. A cost function that considers DGU size and access frequency would be ideal.

**Pseudocode (GM – Coalescence):**

```pseudocode
function coalesce_dgu(dgu_id, adjacent_dgu_id):
  if is_adjacent(dgu_id, adjacent_dgu_id) and is_coalesceable(dgu_id, adjacent_dgu_id):
    lock(dgu_id)
    lock(adjacent_dgu_id)

    new_dgu_id = create_new_dgu(size(dgu_id) + size(adjacent_dgu_id))
    copy_data(dgu_id, new_dgu_id)
    copy_data(adjacent_dgu_id, new_dgu_id, offset = size(dgu_id))

    mark_dgu_invalid(dgu_id)
    mark_dgu_invalid(adjacent_dgu_id)

    update_metadata(new_dgu_id)

    unlock(dgu_id)
    unlock(adjacent_dgu_id)

    return new_dgu_id
  else:
    return null
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-bandwidth memory (HBM) is crucial to support the increased data transfer rates associated with variable-size data blocks.
*   FPGA acceleration could be used for the metadata management and hashing operations.
