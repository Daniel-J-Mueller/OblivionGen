**Dynamic Scene Generation via Generative AI & User-Defined Prompts**

**Concept:** Extend the timeline interface by allowing users to *generate* new scenes or variations of existing scenes using generative AI, directly within the video player interface. The timeline becomes a point of *creation*, not just selection.

**Specifications:**

1.  **AI Scene Generation Module:**
    *   Integrated generative AI engine (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E).
    *   API access for seamless integration with the video player.
    *   Local or cloud-based processing option (user selectable).

2.  **Prompt Interface:**
    *   Timeline scene selection: User selects a scene on the timeline.
    *   Prompt input field:  Text field for user to define desired scene alteration/extension.  Examples: "Make the lighting more dramatic," "Add a futuristic cityscape in the background," "Change the character's outfit to a spacesuit," "Show a close-up of the character's expression."
    *   Style presets: Predefined style options (e.g., “Noir,” “Cyberpunk,” “Impressionist”) to simplify prompt creation.
    *   Parameter sliders: Control parameters like ‘coherence’, ‘detail’, ‘style strength’.
    *   Negative prompts:  Specify elements to *avoid* in the generated scene (e.g., “no rain”, “no crowds”).

3.  **Generation & Integration Workflow:**
    *   Scene isolation: AI isolates the selected scene’s key elements (characters, objects, environment).
    *   AI generation: AI generates a modified or entirely new scene based on the user prompt.
    *   Seamless blending: AI attempts seamless blending of the generated scene into the existing video flow.
    *   Preview: User previews the generated scene within the timeline interface.
    *   Accept/Reject: User accepts or rejects the generated scene. Rejected scenes are discarded.
    *   Timeline update: Accepted scenes replace the original scene on the timeline.

4.  **Timeline Display Enhancements:**
    *   Scene tags: Each scene on the timeline displays a short tag describing its content (automatically generated by AI).
    *   AI generation indicator: Scenes generated by AI are visually distinguished from original scenes (e.g., a different color highlight).
    *   Prompt history: A history of prompts used to generate each scene is accessible.
    *   "Remix" button: Allows users to re-generate a scene with a different prompt.

5.  **Computational Pseudocode:**

    ```pseudocode
    FUNCTION GenerateAIScene(selectedScene, userPrompt, stylePreset, coherence, detail, styleStrength, negativePrompt):
        // 1. Isolate scene elements
        sceneElements = IsolateSceneElements(selectedScene)

        // 2. Generate new scene using AI
        newScene = GenerateSceneWithAI(sceneElements, userPrompt, stylePreset, coherence, detail, styleStrength, negativePrompt)

        // 3. Blend new scene into original video
        blendedScene = BlendScenes(originalVideo, newScene, selectedScene)

        // 4. Return blended scene
        RETURN blendedScene
    ```

6.  **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   GPU acceleration recommended for faster scene generation.
    *   Sufficient RAM to handle large video files and AI processing.

7. **Potential User Story:**
    * A user is watching a historical drama. They want to see a particular scene with a more futuristic aesthetic. They select the scene on the timeline, enter the prompt "cyberpunk cityscape background," adjust the style strength slider, and click "Generate." The AI generates a modified scene with a futuristic cityscape replacing the original background. The user previews the scene and accepts the change, seamlessly integrating it into the video.
