## Dynamic Trust Score Propagation & "Shadow Profiles"

**Concept:** Expand beyond sender/recipient assessment to a networked trust score that considers interactions *between* users, creating "shadow profiles" built from observed communication patterns, not declared data. This enables proactive fraud detection based on emergent group behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Graph Construction:**

*   **Communication Graph:** Construct a directed graph where nodes represent users. Edges represent communication instances (messages). Edge weight = a combined score based on message content analysis (as in the original patent), communication frequency, and implicit user ratings (e.g., message replies, positive/negative feedback inferred from message sentiment).
*   **Interaction History:** Maintain a detailed history of all user interactions (messages, replies, ratings, transaction confirmations) for at least 12 months.
*   **Shadow Profile Generation:** For each user, build a “shadow profile” consisting of:
    *   **Network Centrality:** Metrics like degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality within the communication graph.
    *   **Interaction Clusters:** Identify groups of users the target user frequently interacts with.
    *   **Behavioral Signatures:** Track patterns in communication style (e.g., length of messages, keyword usage, time of day communication), transaction frequency and value, and feedback patterns.

**2. Dynamic Trust Score Propagation:**

*   **Initial Trust Score:** Each user begins with a neutral trust score.
*   **Propagation Algorithm:** Implement a trust propagation algorithm (e.g., weighted average, Bayesian network) to update trust scores based on observed interactions.
    *   **Positive Influence:** When a user with a high trust score interacts with another user, the latter’s trust score is increased proportionally to the strength of the connection.
    *   **Negative Influence:** When a user with a low trust score interacts with another user, the latter’s trust score is decreased.
    *   **Decay Factor:** Implement a decay factor to gradually reduce the influence of past interactions.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor trust score changes for significant deviations from expected patterns.
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:** The system's initial fraud assessment must consider the user's trust score when evaluating message content.

**3. Proactive Fraud Detection & Mitigation:**

*   **Emergent Risk Group Identification:** Identify groups of users exhibiting coordinated suspicious behavior (e.g., rapid communication cycles, shared keywords, unusually high transaction volumes).
*   **Preemptive Blocking:** Automatically flag or block communications from users identified as high-risk based on emergent risk group identification, even before a specific fraudulent transaction occurs.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Adjust fraud thresholds dynamically based on the overall risk level within the communication network.
*   **Communication Restrictions:** Restrict communication privileges for users with exceptionally low trust scores (e.g., limit message length, require CAPTCHA verification).

**4. Pseudocode (Trust Score Update):**

```
function updateTrustScore(userA, userB, interactionScore):
    trustScoreA = getUserTrustScore(userA)
    trustScoreB = getUserTrustScore(userB)

    influenceFactor = interactionScore * 0.1 //Adjustable parameter

    newTrustScoreA = trustScoreA + (trustScoreB * influenceFactor)
    newTrustScoreB = trustScoreB + (trustScoreA * influenceFactor)

    setUserTrustScore(userA, newTrustScoreA)
    setUserTrustScore(userB, newTrustScoreB)

    //Apply Decay (Example - Reduce Trust by 1% per week)
    decayFactor = 0.99 //Weekly decay
    setUserTrustScore(userA, userA * decayFactor)
    setUserTrustScore(userB, userB * decayFactor)
end function
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:** Implement anonymization techniques to protect user privacy while still enabling effective fraud detection.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a large number of users and communications.
*   **Explainability:** Provide mechanisms to explain why a particular communication was flagged as suspicious.
*   **Machine Learning Integration**: The algorithm should use supervised learning to refine the trust propagation and anomaly detection systems.
