## Dynamic Schema Bridging with Generative Embeddings

**Concept:** Extend the entity record relationship analysis to seamlessly handle records with drastically different schemas *without* predefined mappings. Leverage generative AI to create "schema bridges" dynamically during the analysis process.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Schema Discovery Module:**
    *   Input: Two entity records with potentially differing schemas.
    *   Process: Identify all attributes within each record. For unstructured data (text, images), use attribute extraction techniques (e.g., named entity recognition, object detection).
    *   Output: A list of attributes for each record, along with their data types (string, number, image, etc.).

2.  **Generative Embedding Network (GEN):**
    *   Architecture: Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model.
    *   Input:
        *   Attribute list for Record 1.
        *   Attribute list for Record 2.
        *   A "prompt" defining the relationship task (e.g., "find matching products", "identify potential duplicates", "assess semantic similarity").
    *   Process:
        *   Encode the attribute lists and prompt into a combined embedding vector.
        *   Decode the embedding vector into a set of "virtual attributes" representing a shared schema. These virtual attributes are *not* pre-defined; they are generated by the GEN based on the input.
        *   Output: A list of virtual attributes, along with a mapping function for each record indicating how its native attributes contribute to each virtual attribute.
    *   Training: Train the GEN on a large dataset of diverse entity records and relationship tasks. Use a loss function that encourages the generation of informative and consistent virtual attributes.

3.  **Feature Extraction & Fusion:**
    *   Input: Original records, virtual attribute definitions, mapping functions.
    *   Process:
        *   For each record, extract feature vectors from its native attributes according to the mapping functions.
        *   Fuse the extracted feature vectors to create a unified feature representation for each record in the virtual attribute space. This ensures both records are represented using a consistent set of features, even with differing original schemas.

4.  **Relationship Scoring Model:**
    *   Input: Unified feature representations for each record.
    *   Process: Use the existing text and non-text sub-models (from the original patent) to calculate a similarity score based on the unified feature representations.
    *   Output: Relationship score reflecting the similarity between the two records.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function analyze_records(record1, record2, task):
  attributes1 = discover_attributes(record1)
  attributes2 = discover_attributes(record2)

  virtual_attributes, mapping1, mapping2 = GEN(attributes1, attributes2, task)

  features1 = extract_features(record1, mapping1)
  features2 = extract_features(record2, mapping2)

  similarity_score = relationship_scoring_model(features1, features2)

  return similarity_score
```

**Novelty:**

This design moves beyond static schema matching. It dynamically constructs a shared representation for records with different schemas, allowing for more flexible and accurate relationship analysis. The use of a generative model enables adaptation to previously unseen schema variations, improving the robustness and scalability of the system.
