## Dynamic Emotional Palette Generation & Projection

**Concept:** Extend the color-based recommendation system to incorporate dynamic generation of color palettes keyed to emotional states derived from user input (text, voice, facial expression) and project these palettes onto ambient environments via smart lighting, displays, or projected augmented reality.

**Specs:**

*   **Input Module:**
    *   **Text Analysis:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine to determine emotional tone (valence, arousal, dominance) from user-provided text (e.g., social media posts, journal entries, search queries).
    *   **Voice Analysis:**  Real-time audio processing to analyze speech patterns (pitch, cadence, intensity) and infer emotional state.
    *   **Facial Expression Recognition:** Camera-based system utilizing computer vision and machine learning to detect and interpret facial expressions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, fear).  Output emotion confidence scores.
*   **Emotional-Color Mapping Engine:**
    *   A pre-trained model (or configurable ruleset) linking emotional states (as defined by the Input Module) to specific color palettes.  This model should allow for nuanced expression – a "slightly anxious" state should generate a different palette than "severe panic".  The palette generation *isn't* simply assigning colors to emotions, but rather creating *gradients* and *relationships* between colors.
    *   Palette variety: Model must generate palettes that vary in terms of color count (2-7 colors), saturation, brightness, and color harmony (complementary, analogous, triadic).
    *   Personalization: Store user emotional profiles and adjust palette generation accordingly.
*   **Environmental Projection Module:**
    *   **Smart Lighting Control:** Integrate with existing smart home lighting systems (e.g., Philips Hue, LIFX) to dynamically adjust room lighting based on generated palettes.  Allow for different "zones" within a room, each with a unique emotional lighting scheme.
    *   **Display Integration:**  Control color and brightness of connected displays (TVs, monitors, digital signage) to project palette colors onto surfaces or create immersive visual environments.
    *   **Augmented Reality (AR) Projection:** Utilize AR projection technology (e.g., projectors, holographic displays) to overlay palette colors onto real-world objects or create floating, ethereal visual effects.  Consider integrating with spatial mapping technology to ensure accurate projection onto complex surfaces.
*   **User Interface (UI):**
    *   Allow users to manually override the system's emotional analysis and select a desired color palette.
    *   Provide visualizations of the detected emotional state and the corresponding color palette.
    *   Enable users to customize the sensitivity of the emotional analysis and adjust the intensity of the environmental projection.
    *   Enable users to “seed” palettes with preferred color sets or images for influence.

**Pseudocode (Palette Generation):**

```
function generate_palette(emotion_vector, user_profile):
  # emotion_vector: a numerical representation of the detected emotion
  # user_profile: user preferences and historical data

  # Retrieve base palette from emotion-color mapping model
  base_palette = model.lookup(emotion_vector)

  # Adjust base palette based on user profile
  adjusted_palette = apply_user_preferences(base_palette, user_profile)

  # Randomize palette slightly to introduce variation
  final_palette = randomize_palette(adjusted_palette)

  return final_palette

function apply_user_preferences(palette, profile):
  # Adjust color saturation, brightness, and hue based on user preferences
  # Apply any pre-defined color schemes or preferred color ranges
  return adjusted_palette

function randomize_palette(palette):
  # Introduce subtle variations in color values to prevent repetition
  # Maintain overall color harmony and aesthetic appeal
  return randomized_palette
```

**Novelty:**  This system goes beyond recommending items *based* on color; it *creates* and *projects* colors to influence the user’s environment, responding dynamically to their emotional state.  The combination of multi-modal emotion detection, personalized palette generation, and dynamic environmental projection is a unique approach to ambient computing and emotional wellbeing. It is also a departure from simply mapping emotion to color, and instead using color as a generative tool for building immersive experiences.
