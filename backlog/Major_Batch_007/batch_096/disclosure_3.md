## Dynamic FPGA Partition Migration

**Concept:** Enable live migration of accelerator partitions within the FPGA fabric during runtime, without interrupting the supervisor or other active partitions. This goes beyond simple reprogramming; it's a *physical* relocation of logic resources.

**Specification:**

*   **FPGA Architecture:** Utilize a fine-grained, reconfigurable interconnect fabric within the FPGA.  This isn’t simply LUT/FF allocation; we need the ability to dynamically route signals between *any* physical location on the chip.
*   **Partition Abstraction Layer (PAL):** Create a software layer that presents each accelerator partition as a logical entity to both user and supervisor processes. The PAL hides the physical location of the partition.
*   **Migration Trigger:**  Migration can be initiated by the supervisor process based on criteria such as resource utilization, thermal conditions, or security policies.  A user process can *request* migration, but the supervisor must approve.
*   **Migration Process:**
    1.  **Resource Allocation:** The supervisor identifies available resources in a target location within the FPGA.
    2.  **State Capture:** A snapshot of the accelerator partition’s state (registers, memory contents, etc.) is taken.
    3.  **Logic Replication:** The accelerator partition’s logic is instantiated in the target location.
    4.  **State Restoration:** The captured state is restored into the replicated logic.
    5.  **Interconnect Update:** The FPGA’s interconnect fabric is reprogrammed to redirect signals to the new location.  This is the most critical and potentially time-consuming step. It must be done atomically to avoid data corruption.
    6.  **Verification:** A self-test routine is executed on the migrated partition to verify functionality.
    7.  **Old Partition Deallocation:** The original resources are released.
*   **Interconnect Control Unit (ICU):** Dedicated hardware within the FPGA responsible for managing the interconnect fabric. The ICU receives commands from the supervisor and executes the necessary routing changes.  This unit must support atomic updates to prevent glitches.
*   **Communication Protocol:** A low-latency, high-bandwidth communication protocol for exchanging data between the supervisor, user processes, and the ICU.  Consider a dedicated AXI stream interface.
*   **Security Considerations:** Implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized migration or data access.  This includes authentication, encryption, and access control.

**Pseudocode (Supervisor Process - Initiate Migration):**

```
function migrate_partition(partition_id, target_location) {
  if (validate_migration_request(partition_id, target_location)) {
    //1. Allocate resources at the target location.
    allocation_result = allocate_fpga_resources(target_location, partition_size);

    if (allocation_result == SUCCESS) {
       //2. Freeze partition operation and capture state
       freeze_partition(partition_id);
       state = capture_partition_state(partition_id);

       //3. Instantiate logic at new location
       instantiate_logic(target_location, partition_id);

       //4. Restore state
       restore_state(target_location, state);

       //5. Update interconnect routing
       update_interconnect_routing(partition_id, target_location);

       //6. Verify functionality
       verification_result = verify_partition_functionality(target_location);

       if(verification_result == PASS){
           //7. Release original resources
           release_fpga_resources(original_location);
           return SUCCESS;
       } else {
           //Rollback - Restore original state, release resources
           rollback_migration(partition_id);
           return FAILURE;
       }
    } else {
        return RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE;
    }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Dynamic Load Balancing:** Migrate partitions to underutilized areas of the FPGA.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  Migrate partitions away from failing physical locations.
*   **Security:** Isolate compromised partitions by migrating them to a restricted area.
*   **Adaptive Computing:** Dynamically reconfigure the FPGA fabric to optimize performance for different workloads.
