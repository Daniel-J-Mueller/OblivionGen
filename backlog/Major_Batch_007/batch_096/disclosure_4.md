## Dynamic Viseme-Driven Emotional Avatars

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Functionality:**

*   **Emotional State Input:** System accepts real-time emotional state data as input. Sources include:
    *   Facial expression analysis (camera input)
    *   Voice tone analysis (microphone input)
    *   Biometric data (heart rate, skin conductance - optional wearable integration)
    *   Textual sentiment analysis (optional - for text-to-speech input)
*   **Emotional Mapping:**  A mapping system correlates detected emotional states (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, neutral) with a library of pre-defined "emotional viseme blends".  These blends are *not* simply additive combinations of base visemes (e.g., adding 'sadness' to 'mouth open'). They represent fundamentally altered viseme shapes and timings, creating nuanced facial expressions.
*   **Dynamic Viseme Generation:** The system generates viseme data *informed by both* audio analysis (as in the source patent) *and* the current emotional state. This process involves:
    *   Audio-driven base viseme selection (traditional lip-sync).
    *   Emotional state-driven *modification* of selected visemes – shifting shapes, adjusting timings, adding micro-expressions.
*   **Avatar Rendering:** The modified viseme data drives an avatar’s facial animation. Avatar can be 2D, 3D, realistic, or stylized.
*   **Output Devices:**  System supports output to a variety of devices: screens (for 2D/3D avatars), animatronic devices (as per the patent), VR/AR headsets.

**II. Hardware Components:**

*   High-resolution camera (for facial expression analysis).
*   Microphone array (for voice tone analysis).
*   Optional biometric sensors (wearable integration).
*   Powerful processing unit (GPU recommended for real-time rendering).
*   Output display/animatronic interface.

**III. Software Architecture:**

*   **Module 1: Emotion Detection:**  Utilizes machine learning models (CNNs for facial expressions, RNNs for voice tone) to identify emotional states.
*   **Module 2: Emotional Viseme Blender:** The core innovation. This module:
    *   Maintains a library of emotional viseme blends.
    *   Receives audio-driven base viseme data and emotional state data.
    *   Applies the appropriate blend to the base visemes, generating modified viseme data.
*   **Module 3: Avatar Animation Engine:**  Renders the modified viseme data onto the avatar, creating realistic and emotionally expressive animation.
*   **Module 4: Communication Interface:**  Transmits the modified viseme data to the output device.

**IV. Pseudocode (Emotional Viseme Blender Module):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION BlendVisemes(audioVisemes, emotionalState)

  //emotionalState: ENUM {Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Neutral}

  //Lookup emotional blend from library
  emotionalBlend = GetEmotionalBlend(emotionalState)

  //Apply blend to audio visemes
  modifiedVisemes = []
  FOR EACH viseme IN audioVisemes DO
    modifiedViseme = ApplyBlend(viseme, emotionalBlend)
    APPEND modifiedViseme TO modifiedVisemes
  END FOR

  RETURN modifiedVisemes
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION ApplyBlend(viseme, emotionalBlend)
  //Emotional blend contains transformation parameters (scale, rotation, translation)
  //for different viseme features (lips, cheeks, eyebrows, etc.)

  //Apply transformations to viseme features
  modifiedViseme = TransformViseme(viseme, emotionalBlend)

  RETURN modifiedViseme
END FUNCTION
```

**V. Advanced Features:**

*   **Personalized Emotion Mapping:**  System learns individual emotional expressions to create more accurate and personalized avatars.
*   **Contextual Emotion Awareness:**  Integrates contextual information (e.g., the content of the audio) to refine emotional expressions.
*   **Cross-Modal Emotion Transfer:**  Transfers emotional expressions between different avatars (e.g., allowing a virtual avatar to mimic the emotional state of a human user).
*   **Subtle Micro-expression Generation:** Algorithm to generate small, involuntary movements to make the avatar more realistic.
*   **Real-time Expression Editing**: Allows a user to manually tweak the generated expressions for finer control.
