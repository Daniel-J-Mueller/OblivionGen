**Automated Event Reconstruction & Proactive Media Synthesis**

**Concept:** Expanding beyond simply *grouping* existing images, this system proactively *reconstructs* events and *synthesizes* missing media to provide a fully immersive and contextualized experience.

**Specs:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Data Ingestion:** System accepts image, video, audio, location data (GPS, beacons), sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope), and potentially social media posts (with user permission) as input.

2.  **Temporal Event Graph Construction:** A directed graph is created where nodes represent individual media instances (images, video clips, audio recordings) and edges represent temporal relationships between them. Edge weights reflect confidence levels based on timestamps, location proximity, and content similarity (e.g., visual feature matching).

3.  **Event Segmentation & Scene Detection:**  Algorithm identifies distinct events/scenes within the graph based on changes in temporal density, location, and content. A “scene score” is calculated combining these factors. Thresholding scene scores isolates discrete events.

4.  **Missing Media Prediction & Synthesis:**  For each event, the system identifies gaps in coverage (e.g., missing viewpoints, obscured objects). Utilizing generative AI models (GANs, diffusion models), it *synthesizes* plausible missing media to fill these gaps. This could involve:
    *   **Viewpoint Synthesis:** Generating images/videos from a novel viewpoint based on existing coverage and 3D scene reconstruction.
    *   **Object Completion:**  Filling in occluded or missing objects based on contextual understanding.
    *   **Scene Extension:** Extending the duration of an event by generating plausible frames beyond the existing coverage.

5.  **Proactive Content Delivery & User Interface:** System proactively delivers reconstructed events to users based on identified interests and preferences. The UI presents a dynamic, immersive experience incorporating:
    *   **3D Scene Visualization:**  A navigable 3D representation of the reconstructed event.
    *   **Mixed Reality Integration:**  Overlaying reconstructed content onto the user's real-world environment (via AR/VR devices).
    *   **Personalized Storytelling:** Automatically generating a narrative storyline for the event, highlighting key moments and participants.

**Pseudocode (Core Synthesis Loop):**

```
function synthesize_event(event_graph, missing_viewpoints):
  for viewpoint in missing_viewpoints:
    #Estimate camera parameters (position, orientation) for the missing viewpoint
    camera_params = estimate_camera_params(event_graph, viewpoint)

    # Render plausible image/video from the estimated viewpoint
    synthesized_media = render_media(event_graph, camera_params)

    #Add synthesized media to event_graph
    event_graph.add_media(synthesized_media)

  return event_graph
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance GPU(s) for AI model training and inference.
*   Large RAM capacity for storing event graphs and synthesized media.
*   Fast storage (SSD/NVMe) for efficient data access.
*   AR/VR device compatibility (optional).
