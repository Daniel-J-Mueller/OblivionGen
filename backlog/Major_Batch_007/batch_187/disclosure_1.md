## Adaptive Acoustic Zones & Intent Prediction

**Concept:**  Leverage spatial audio analysis and predictive modeling to create dynamic acoustic zones around a voice-controlled device, optimizing wake word detection *and* preemptively anticipating user intent based on localized sound events. 

**Specification:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** A circular array of at least 8 MEMS microphones integrated into the device.  Microphones spaced ~5-10cm apart for beamforming and sound source localization.
*   **Spatial Audio Processing Unit:** Dedicated DSP or FPGA for real-time beamforming, sound source localization (azimuth, elevation, distance), and acoustic event classification.
*   **Low-Latency Processor:** High-speed processor for running intent prediction models and managing adaptive acoustic zone configurations.

**II. Software Components & Algorithm:**

1.  **Acoustic Zone Definition:**
    *   The system dynamically divides the surrounding space into multiple overlapping acoustic zones.
    *   Zone boundaries are defined by spherical coordinates centered on the device.
    *   Initial zones: Front (0-60 degrees), Left (90-150 degrees), Right (150-210 degrees), Back (210-360 degrees), Above, Below.
2.  **Sound Source Localization & Tracking:**
    *   Employ beamforming techniques (e.g., Delay-and-Sum, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response) to determine the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of sound sources.
    *   Triangulate sound source locations using multiple microphones.
    *   Track sound source movement over time.
3.  **Acoustic Event Classification:**
    *   Train a machine learning model (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network) to classify acoustic events into categories:
        *   Speech (human voice)
        *   Music
        *   Environmental sounds (e.g., TV, radio, doorbell, footsteps)
        *   Specific object sounds (e.g., keyboard typing, coffee maker, blender).
4.  **Adaptive Wake Word Sensitivity:**
    *   Adjust wake word detection sensitivity *per acoustic zone*.
    *   Zones with frequent speech activity: Lower sensitivity to reduce false positives.
    *   Zones with low speech activity: Higher sensitivity to capture distant or quiet wake words.
5.  **Intent Prediction Model:**
    *   Train a recurrent neural network (RNN) or Transformer model on a dataset of sound events and corresponding user actions. 
    *   Input: Sequence of acoustic events (from acoustic zone analysis).
    *   Output: Probability distribution over potential user intents (e.g., "play music," "set timer," "make call," "turn on lights," "adjust volume").
6.  **Preemptive Processing:**
    *   If the intent prediction model predicts a high probability of a specific intent, preemptively load the necessary resources or initiate related actions. (e.g., start music streaming service, prepare timer interface, pre-dial phone number).
7.  **Wake Word Bypass:**
    *   In specific cases, if the intent prediction model has *very high* confidence in a specific intent, bypass the wake word requirement entirely. (e.g., if the system detects consistent keyboard typing and predicts “dictate message”, automatically initiate voice dictation.)

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    audioData = captureAudio();
    zoneData = analyzeAcousticZones(audioData);

    for (each zone in zoneData) {
        zone.sensitivity = adjustSensitivity(zone.activityLevel);
        zone.predictedIntent = predictIntent(zone.eventSequence);
    }

    potentialWakeWord = detectWakeWord(audioData, zoneData.sensitivity);

    if (potentialWakeWord) {
        // Proceed with normal wake word processing
    } else {
        // Check for high-confidence intent predictions
        highConfidenceIntent = findHighConfidenceIntent(zoneData);

        if (highConfidenceIntent) {
            bypassWakeWord = true;
            // Initiate action associated with highConfidenceIntent
        }
    }

    if (bypassWakeWord){
       processIntent(highConfidenceIntent);
    }
}

```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced false positives and improved wake word detection accuracy.
*   Faster response times and more fluid user experience.
*   Enhanced privacy by reducing unnecessary audio processing.
*   Increased user satisfaction through proactive and intuitive assistance.
