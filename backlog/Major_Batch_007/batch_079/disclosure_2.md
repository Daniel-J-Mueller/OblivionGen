## Spatial Audio Beacon System

**Concept:** Augment the visual device tracking with a spatially aware audio beacon system, creating a richer, more intuitive understanding of device proximity and location.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 4, optimally 8) integrated into the primary device (the one performing the tracking). Microphones arranged in a circular or tetrahedral pattern to maximize spatial awareness.
    *   Ultrasonic transmitters integrated into the tracked devices. These transmitters should be low-power, directional (beamforming capability preferred) and capable of transmitting a unique identifier.
    *   High-fidelity audio output on the primary device (speakers or headphones).

*   **Software:**
    *   **Ultrasonic Signal Processing Module:**
        *   Receives raw audio data from the microphone array.
        *   Filters out ambient noise.
        *   Detects and decodes ultrasonic signals from tracked devices, identifying the unique ID.
        *   Calculates Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) for each signal, enabling triangulation to determine the device’s 3D position.
        *   Algorithm to mitigate multipath interference and signal reflection.
    *   **Spatial Audio Rendering Module:**
        *   Takes the calculated 3D positions of tracked devices as input.
        *   Renders a spatial audio “beacon” for each device – a distinct sound (e.g., chime, tone, voice prompt) positioned in 3D space relative to the user.
        *   Dynamically adjusts beacon volume and panning based on device distance and direction.
        *   Allows user customization of beacon sounds and sensitivity.
    *   **Sensor Fusion Module:**
        *   Combines data from the image-based tracking system (as described in the patent) with data from the ultrasonic system.
        *   Prioritizes data sources based on reliability (e.g., image tracking in clear view, ultrasonic in obstructed view).
        *   Applies Kalman filtering to smooth position estimates and reduce jitter.
    *   **User Interface:**
        *   Visual representation of tracked devices on screen, mirroring the audio beacon positions.
        *   Settings for adjusting audio beacon volume, pan, and customization.
        *   Option to disable visual or audio feedback independently.

*   **Pseudocode (Spatial Audio Rendering):**

```
FUNCTION RenderSpatialAudio(devicePositions):
  FOR EACH device IN devicePositions:
    distance = CalculateDistance(userPosition, device.position)
    direction = CalculateDirection(userPosition, device.position)
    volume = Map(distance, 0, maxDistance, maxVolume, 0) // Inverse map
    pan = CalculatePan(direction) // Based on azimuth and elevation
    PlaySound(device.soundID, volume, pan)
  END FOR
END FUNCTION
```

*   **Potential Use Cases:**
    *   Enhanced AR/VR experiences.
    *   Assistive technology for visually impaired users (spatial audio guidance).
    *   Gaming (accurate positional audio for multiplayer).
    *   Factory/warehouse environments (tracking tools/equipment).
