## Mobile Environmental Mapping & Predictive Alerting System

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Ruggedized mobile device (similar form factor to existing device, but with enhanced sensors).
*   **Sensors:**
    *   High-resolution LiDAR scanner (for rapid 3D environmental mapping).
    *   Multi-gas sensor array (detects VOCs, CO, CO2, methane, etc.).
    *   Thermal imaging camera.
    *   High-fidelity microphone array (for sound event detection & localization).
    *   Barometric pressure sensor.
*   **Communication:** 5G/Wi-Fi 6E/Satellite Uplink (redundant connectivity).
*   **Processing:** On-device edge computing (high-performance CPU/GPU/NPU).
*   **Power:** High-density battery pack (hot-swappable).
*   **Software:** Custom-built AI/ML platform.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Automated Mapping:** As a responder moves through the data center, the mobile device autonomously constructs a dynamic 3D map of the environment.  LiDAR & visual data are fused to create a detailed representation, including asset locations (servers, cooling units, power supplies). The map also includes sensor readings overlaid as a ‘heat map’ visualization.

2.  **Baseline Establishment:** During initial setup/calibration, the system establishes a ‘normal’ environmental baseline for each location within the mapped area. This includes temperature, humidity, gas concentrations, noise levels, and thermal signatures.

3.  **Anomaly Detection:** Real-time sensor data is continuously compared to the established baseline. AI/ML algorithms detect anomalies – deviations from the expected normal state.  Examples: 
    *   Unusual temperature spikes near a server rack.
    *   Elevated gas concentrations (e.g., coolant leak).
    *   Unexpected sounds (e.g., failing fan, arcing electricity).

4.  **Predictive Alerting:**  The system doesn't just *react* to problems; it *predicts* them. Time-series analysis of sensor data identifies trends that indicate potential failures *before* they occur. This utilizes recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.  Alerts are prioritized based on severity and predicted time-to-failure.

5.  **Dynamic Risk Assessment:** The system dynamically assesses risk based on both real-time conditions and predictive modeling. This data informs responder routing and prioritization.

6.  **Augmented Reality (AR) Overlay:** The system projects relevant information onto the responder's AR headset or mobile device screen. This includes:
    *   3D map with highlighted anomalies.
    *   Sensor data overlays.
    *   Optimal routing paths.
    *   Equipment schematics.

7.  **Automated Reporting:**  All sensor data, alerts, and responder actions are automatically logged and reported to a central monitoring system.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
// Define baseline parameters (average, standard deviation) for each sensor type
sensorBaseline = {
    "temperature": { "avg": 22.0, "stdDev": 1.0 },
    "gas_concentration": { "avg": 50.0, "stdDev": 5.0 },
    // ... other sensors
}

// Function to detect anomalies
function detectAnomaly(sensorType, sensorValue) {
    baseline = sensorBaseline[sensorType]
    zScore = (sensorValue - baseline.avg) / baseline.stdDev
    if (abs(zScore) > threshold) { // Threshold adjustable
        return true // Anomaly detected
    }
    return false
}

// Main loop - continuously monitor sensors
while (true) {
    temperature = readTemperatureSensor()
    gasConcentration = readGasSensor()

    if (detectAnomaly("temperature", temperature) || detectAnomaly("gas_concentration", gasConcentration)) {
        triggerAlert("Anomaly detected! Temperature: " + temperature + ", Gas: " + gasConcentration)
    }
}
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple alarm response. It focuses on *proactive* environmental monitoring, predictive maintenance, and enhanced situational awareness. The combination of dynamic 3D mapping, multi-sensor fusion, and AI-powered predictive analytics creates a significantly more robust and intelligent system. It's a shift from 'reacting to incidents' to 'preventing incidents'.
