## Variable Geometry Propeller Guard System

**System Overview:** A dynamically adjustable, multi-segmented propeller guard system leveraging micro-actuators and proximity sensors to create a customizable safety perimeter around each propeller. This goes beyond a static guard by actively reshaping itself based on environmental analysis and predicted object trajectories.

**Components:**

*   **Propeller Guard Segments:** Multiple (8-16 per propeller) small, overlapping segments constructed from a lightweight, flexible, yet durable polymer composite. Each segment contains embedded proximity sensors (infrared, ultrasonic, or LIDAR) and a micro-actuator (piezoelectric, shape memory alloy, or miniature linear motor).
*   **Central Control Unit (CCU):** A dedicated processor responsible for receiving sensor data, performing trajectory analysis, and controlling the micro-actuators. Integrated with the AAV's main flight controller.
*   **Proximity Sensors:** Each segment possesses multiple proximity sensors to detect objects within a defined range. Data is fed to the CCU.
*   **Micro-Actuators:** Control the angle and position of each guard segment, allowing for dynamic reshaping of the safety perimeter.
*   **Power System:** Dedicated, lightweight power source to supply energy to the micro-actuators and sensors. Potentially integrated with the AAV’s existing power system.

**Operational Modes:**

1.  **Passive Mode:** Segments maintain a default, pre-defined protective shape, providing a basic level of safety.
2.  **Reactive Mode:** When an object is detected within a certain range, the segments dynamically adjust to create a larger safety perimeter around the propeller, pushing the object away or diverting it from the propeller’s path.
3.  **Predictive Mode:** Utilizing object tracking and trajectory prediction algorithms, the system anticipates potential collisions and proactively adjusts the guard segments *before* an object enters the immediate vicinity of the propeller.

**Pseudocode (Reactive Mode):**

```
//For each propeller:
FOR each segment IN propeller.segments:
    distance = segment.getDistanceToObject()
    IF distance < threshold:
        angle = calculateAngleToDivertObject(segment, object)
        segment.setAngle(angle)
    ELSE:
        segment.setAngle(defaultAngle)
END FOR
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Segment Material:** Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite.
*   **Segment Dimensions:** Approximately 5cm x 2cm.
*   **Actuation Range:** +/- 45 degrees per segment.
*   **Sensor Range:** 0.5m - 5m.
*   **Response Time:** < 50ms for actuation.
*   **Weight (per propeller):** < 200g.
*   **Power Consumption:** < 10W (per propeller).

**Refinements:**

*   **Haptic Feedback:** Incorporate haptic feedback to the segments to provide a tactile warning to nearby objects.
*   **Transparent/Translucent Segments:** Use transparent or translucent materials to minimize visual obstruction.
*   **AI Integration:** Train an AI model to optimize the segment configuration based on real-world data and object behavior.
*   **Self-Healing Materials:** Explore self-healing materials to enhance the durability and longevity of the segments.
