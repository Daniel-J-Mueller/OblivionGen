## Dynamic Data Masking with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Expand the mapping/hashing concept to create a dynamic data masking system that adjusts the level of anonymization based on *observed user behavior* interacting with the data. This goes beyond simple hashing to add a layer of adaptive privacy.

**Specs:**

1.  **Behavioral Data Collection Module:**
    *   Tracks user interactions with data: dwell time on fields, copy/paste actions, export attempts, query patterns, access frequency, time of day access, geographic location of access.
    *   Uses a rolling window to analyze behavioral patterns.
    *   Outputs a "Risk Score" representing the likelihood of malicious intent or unauthorized data access.

2.  **Dynamic Masking Engine:**
    *   Receives the Risk Score from the Behavioral Data Collection Module.
    *   Contains a configurable masking profile with multiple levels:
        *   Level 1: Full anonymization (e.g., hash entire field).
        *   Level 2: Partial anonymization (e.g., mask specific digits, redact parts of strings).
        *   Level 3: Pseudonymization (e.g., replace with a token that can be resolved with appropriate permissions).
        *   Level 4: No masking (raw data).
    *   Maps Risk Score ranges to masking levels.  (e.g., Risk < 20 = Level 4, 20 <= Risk < 50 = Level 3, etc.).
    *   Applies the corresponding masking level to the requested data *in real-time*.

3.  **Mapping Value Integration:**
    *   Extend the existing mapping/hashing to include a “masking seed” derived from the user’s authentication credentials and/or device ID. This ensures consistency in masking across sessions and requests.
    *   The seed is incorporated into the hash function used to generate the mapping value.

4.  **Auditing and Alerting:**
    *   Log all data access events, including the Risk Score, applied masking level, and user/device information.
    *   Generate alerts when the Risk Score exceeds a predefined threshold.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function getData(identifier, user, device):
  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(user, device)
  maskingLevel = getMaskingLevel(riskScore)
  mappingValue = generateMappingValue(identifier, user, device, maskingLevel)
  data = retrieveData(mappingValue)
  applyMasking(data, maskingLevel)
  logAccess(user, device, identifier, riskScore, maskingLevel)
  return data
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Scalable data storage for behavioral data.
*   Real-time data processing engine.
*   Secure authentication and authorization system.
*   API for integration with existing applications.
*   Monitoring and alerting tools.
