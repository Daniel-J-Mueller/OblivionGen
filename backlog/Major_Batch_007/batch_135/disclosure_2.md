## Adaptive Acoustic Masking with Biofeedback

**Concept:** Integrate real-time physiological data (heart rate variability, skin conductance) with the wind noise detection system to dynamically adjust an acoustic masking profile *before* wind noise significantly impacts audio quality.  Rather than solely *reacting* to wind, predict and preemptively mitigate its effects.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrated bio-sensors within the earbud housing (contact-based or near-field capacitive).  Target metrics: Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrodermal Activity (EDA – skin conductance).
*   **Data Acquisition & Processing:**
    *   Sampling Rate: HRV – 100Hz, EDA – 50Hz.
    *   Signal Filtering:  Noise reduction filters (e.g., Kalman filter) to clean raw sensor data.
    *   Feature Extraction:  Calculate HRV metrics (RMSSD, SDNN) and EDA phasic/tonic components.
*   **Predictive Model:**
    *   Algorithm: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) preferred.
    *   Training Data:  Collect synchronized data of bio-sensor readings, wind noise levels (from existing patent tech), and user-reported audio quality (subjective rating via app).
    *   Output:  Probability score indicating the likelihood of the user perceiving wind noise *before* it significantly affects audio.
*   **Acoustic Masking Control:**
    *   Masking Profile: Dynamically adjustable EQ curve applied to incoming audio.  Prioritize frequency bands most susceptible to wind noise interference (determined through experimentation).
    *   Gain Control: Adjust gain within the masking profile.
    *   Adaptive Threshold:  A threshold based on the RNN output.  When the predicted wind noise probability exceeds the threshold, the masking profile is activated/adjusted.
    *   Blending: Smooth blending between normal audio and masked audio to avoid abrupt transitions.
*   **Software Integration:**
    *   Mobile App:  Collect user data, train/update RNN model, adjust thresholds, provide real-time feedback.
    *   Earbud Firmware:  Implement sensor data acquisition, signal processing, RNN inference, and audio masking control.

**Pseudocode (Earbud Firmware - Main Loop):**

```
while (true) {
  // 1. Read Sensor Data
  hrvData = readHRVSensor();
  edaData = readEDASensor();

  // 2. Process Sensor Data
  hrvFeatures = processHRV(hrvData);
  edaFeatures = processEDA(edaData);

  // 3. Run RNN Inference
  windNoiseProbability = runRNN(hrvFeatures, edaFeatures);

  // 4. Adjust Masking Profile
  if (windNoiseProbability > threshold) {
    maskingProfile = generateMaskingProfile(windNoiseProbability);
    applyMaskingProfile(maskingProfile, audioData);
  } else {
    applyNormalAudio(audioData);
  }

  // 5. Output Audio
  outputAudio(processedAudioData);
}
```

**Novelty:**  The core innovation is the *proactive* use of physiological data to anticipate and mitigate wind noise *before* it becomes noticeable, rather than simply reacting to it. This could significantly improve the user experience by preventing disruptions in audio quality.  The integration of biofeedback adds a layer of personalized noise cancellation, tailoring the masking profile to the user's physiological state and sensitivity. This is a shift from reactive to predictive/preventative noise control.
