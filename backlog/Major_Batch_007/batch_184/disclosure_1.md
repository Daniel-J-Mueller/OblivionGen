## Personalized Speechlet "Mood" Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the speechlet recommendation system to incorporate a user's current "mood" or emotional state, influencing speechlet selection beyond just historical usage. This isn't about *detecting* mood (though that could be a future extension), but letting the user *set* their desired interaction style.

**Specs:**

1.  **Mood Profile Creation:**
    *   A user interface (UI) element allowing users to create named mood profiles.
    *   Each profile consists of adjustable parameters influencing speechlet behavior. Examples:
        *   *Conciseness*:  (Scale of 1-10) -  Higher values prioritize short, direct responses. Lower values allow for more verbose, explanatory answers.
        *   *Formality*: (Scale of 1-10) - Higher values prefer formal language and terminology. Lower values allow for colloquialisms and relaxed language.
        *   *Enthusiasm*: (Scale of 1-10) - Controls the level of vocal inflection and positivity in speechlet responses (synthesized speech).
        *   *Patience*: (Scale of 1-10) – Determines how many times a speechlet will re-prompt or offer assistance before assuming the user understands or is abandoning the task.
        *   *Proactiveness*: (Scale of 1-10) - Higher values cause speechlets to offer related suggestions or anticipate user needs. Lower values keep responses strictly focused on the immediate request.

2.  **Mood Profile Activation:**
    *   A UI element allowing users to quickly select an active mood profile.
    *   Voice command integration: “Set mood to ‘Focused’,” “Activate ‘Relaxed’ mode.”

3.  **Speechlet Parameter Adjustment:**
    *   Each speechlet has associated configurable parameters that respond to the active mood profile.
    *   A mapping table defines how mood profile parameters influence speechlet behavior. Example:
        *   If Mood Profile *Conciseness* = 10:
            *   All speechlets reduce response length by 20%.
            *   Remove all explanatory details.
        *   If Mood Profile *Enthusiasm* = 2:
            *   All speechlets use a monotone voice.
            *   Remove all positive affirmations.

4.  **Confidence Value Modulation:**
    *   Incorporate mood profile compatibility into the speechlet confidence value calculation.
    *   If a speechlet’s default behavior aligns well with the active mood profile, increase its confidence value.
    *   If a mismatch exists, decrease the confidence value.

5.  **Example Pseudocode (Confidence Value Calculation):**

```
function calculate_confidence_value(speechlet, mood_profile):
    base_confidence = speechlet.reliability  // From the original patent

    mood_alignment_score = calculate_mood_alignment(speechlet, mood_profile)

    adjusted_confidence = base_confidence * (1 + mood_alignment_score)

    return adjusted_confidence

function calculate_mood_alignment(speechlet, mood_profile):
    // Compare speechlet’s default parameters to mood profile parameters
    // (Conciseness, Formality, Enthusiasm, Patience, Proactiveness)
    // Return a score between -1 and 1, representing the degree of alignment.
    // Example: If speechlet is naturally concise, and mood profile is also concise,
    // mood_alignment_score = 0.5
```

6.  **Implementation Notes:**
    *   A central configuration file or database stores mood profile definitions and speechlet parameter mappings.
    *   The system dynamically adjusts speechlet behavior based on the active mood profile.
    *   Allow users to customize default speechlet parameters and create their own mood profiles.
    *   Consider adding pre-defined mood profiles ("Focused," "Relaxed," "Creative," "Helpful") for convenience.
