## Automated Sorting & Repositioning with Dynamic Friction Control

**Concept:** Expand the unloading system to not just *remove* items, but actively sort and reposition them based on identified characteristics, using dynamically adjustable friction surfaces.

**System Specs:**

*   **Inventory Holder Modification:** Replace the single ‘first platform’ with a modular tile system. Each tile possesses embedded micro-actuators capable of altering surface friction (see Friction Control Unit Specs below). Tile arrangement is configurable to accommodate various item shapes/sizes.
*   **Unloading Station Enhancement:**  Add a series of “divert channels” beneath the deposit surface. Each channel leads to a designated collection area.  Channel selection is controlled by the Friction Control Unit (FCU) in concert with item identification.
*   **Item Identification System:** Integrate a vision system (camera + processing) *above* the inventory holder.  This system identifies items based on shape, size, color, or barcode/QR code.  Data is fed to the Central Control Unit (CCU).
*   **Friction Control Unit (FCU) Specs:**
    *   **Actuation Method:**  Electrostatic adhesion or micro-vibration.  Each tile contains an array of controllable elements.
    *   **Friction Range:**  Coefficient of friction adjustable from 0.05 to 1.5.
    *   **Resolution:**  Individual tile control, allowing for localized friction adjustments.
    *   **Power:** Low-voltage DC.
    *   **Communication:** Wireless mesh network to CCU.
*   **Central Control Unit (CCU) Specs:**
    *   **Processor:** High-speed multi-core processor.
    *   **Memory:** 64GB RAM minimum.
    *   **Connectivity:** Wireless communication (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) and wired Ethernet.
    *   **Software:**  Algorithm for interpreting vision data, controlling FCU, and managing item flow.

**Operation:**

1.  Inventory holder approaches the unloading station.
2.  Vision system identifies the item on the top layer.
3.  CCU determines the appropriate divert channel based on item ID.
4.  As the item reaches the barrier, CCU activates the FCU to reduce friction *only* on the tiles corresponding to the chosen divert channel.
5.  The item slides off the inventory holder and into the designated channel.
6.  The process repeats for each item.

**Pseudocode (CCU Logic):**

```
loop:
    item = visionSystem.identifyItem()
    channel = item.determineChannel()

    for tile in inventoryHolderTiles:
        if tile == channel:
            tile.setFriction(0.05) // Low friction for divert
        else:
            tile.setFriction(0.8) // High friction to retain

    item.unload()

    wait(itemUnloadTime)
end loop
```

**Possible Refinements:**

*   Implement predictive algorithms to pre-activate tiles before the item reaches them.
*   Add a force sensor to each tile for feedback control and collision detection.
*   Integrate with a robotic arm to pick and place items from the divert channels.
*   Dynamic tile reconfiguration to adapt to various item shapes/sizes.
