## Dynamic Attribute Weighting via Biofeedback

**System Overview:**

This system augments the attribute relevance scoring by incorporating real-time biofeedback from the user. The goal is to move beyond predicted relevance and understand *actual* user interest, creating a hyper-personalized browsing experience.

**Components:**

1.  **Biofeedback Sensor:** A wearable sensor (wristband, headset, etc.) capable of measuring physiological signals – heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA - skin conductance), and potentially EEG.
2.  **Real-time Data Acquisition & Processing:** Software to capture the biofeedback signals, filter noise, and translate them into "engagement scores."
3.  **Attribute Engagement Mapping:** A module to correlate changes in engagement scores with specific attributes being displayed or highlighted during the browsing session.
4.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** An algorithm that adjusts attribute relevance scores *in real-time* based on the observed engagement.

**Data Flow & Algorithm:**

1.  **Baseline Capture:** Upon initiation of a browsing session, establish a baseline for the user's physiological signals.
2.  **Attribute Presentation:** As items and associated attributes are displayed, monitor biofeedback signals.
3.  **Engagement Detection:** Analyze changes from the baseline. Increased HRV generally indicates relaxation and engagement. EDA increases indicate heightened arousal (could be positive or negative).  EEG data, if available, could identify specific cognitive states.
4.  **Attribute-Signal Association:**  When a change in engagement is detected *concurrent* with the presentation of a specific attribute (e.g., ‘waterproof’, ‘vegan’, ‘high-resolution’), record a correlation.
5.  **Weight Adjustment:** Increase the relevance score of attributes showing a positive correlation. Decrease the score for those with negative correlation.  Apply a decay function to past correlations to account for shifting interests.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
baselineHRV = captureBaselineHRV()
baselineEDA = captureBaselineEDA()

// During Browsing Session
loop {
    item = nextItemInCatalog()
    attributes = getItemAttributes(item)

    displayItem(item, attributes)

    currentHRV = captureHRV()
    currentEDA = captureEDA()

    hrvChange = currentHRV - baselineHRV
    edaChange = currentEDA - baselineEDA

    for each attribute in attributes {
        //Check if attribute was visually presented during last 'x' seconds
        if (attributeDisplayedRecently) {
            engagementScore = (hrvChange * weightHRV) + (edaChange * weightEDA)

            //Apply decay function to past engagement scores for the attribute
            pastEngagementScore = getPastEngagementScore(attribute)
            engagementScore = (engagementScore * alpha) + (pastEngagementScore * (1-alpha))

            //Update attribute relevance score
            attribute.relevanceScore += engagementScore * learningRate
            attribute.relevanceScore = clamp(attribute.relevanceScore, 0, 1) //Ensure score remains within bounds
            savePastEngagementScore(attribute, engagementScore)
        }
    }

    //Re-sort items based on updated attribute relevance scores
    sortedItems = sortItemsByAttributeRelevance(items)
    displayNextItem(sortedItems[0])
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Wearable biofeedback sensor with API access.
*   Real-time data processing unit (could be integrated into the browsing device or cloud-based).

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **User Profiling:**  Combine biofeedback data with user demographics and past browsing history to create more accurate engagement models.
*   **Adaptive Sensor Calibration:**  Dynamically calibrate the biofeedback sensor to individual users to improve signal accuracy.
*   **Emotional State Detection:** Utilize more advanced signal processing techniques to infer the user's emotional state (e.g., excitement, frustration).
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** Implement a framework for A/B testing different weight adjustment algorithms and sensor configurations.
