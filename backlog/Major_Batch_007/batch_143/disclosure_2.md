## Dynamic Scene Complexity Scaling

**Concept:** A system that dynamically adjusts the graphical complexity of a scene based on both network conditions *and* client-side predictive modeling of rendering bottlenecks. This goes beyond simply ignoring service requests; it proactively *re-architects* scene rendering on the fly.

**Specs:**

1.  **Scene Graph Decomposition:** The core scene is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each node represents a renderable object or a group of objects. Nodes are tagged with complexity metrics (polygon count, texture size, shader complexity, etc.).
2.  **Predictive Bottleneck Analysis:** The client monitors GPU/CPU usage during rendering. A machine learning model (trained offline on various hardware configurations) predicts potential rendering bottlenecks *before* they occur. Inputs: current frame statistics, scene graph structure, complexity metrics, network latency/bandwidth estimates. Output: a "risk score" for each node in the DAG.
3.  **Dynamic Complexity Reduction:** 
    *   **Node Simplification:** Based on risk scores and network conditions, the client identifies nodes with high risk. These nodes are replaced with simplified versions (lower polygon count models, lower resolution textures, simpler shaders). A library of pre-computed simplified versions is stored locally.
    *   **Layered Rendering Re-ordering:**  Scene layers are dynamically re-ordered. Less critical layers (e.g., distant foliage) are rendered *after* more critical layers (e.g., player character). This allows the client to prioritize rendering the most important parts of the scene, even under load.
    *   **Procedural Detail Removal:**  Certain procedural details (e.g., particle effects, dynamic shadows) are removed or reduced in complexity.  The client can selectively disable or simplify these effects based on risk scores.
4.  **Service Request Adjustment:** The client adjusts service requests based on predicted bottlenecks. If a high-complexity object is likely to cause a bottleneck, the client may request a lower-detail version from the service *before* rendering even begins.
5.  **Seamless Transition:** The system should minimize visual artifacts during transitions between different levels of detail. Techniques like temporal anti-aliasing and blending can be used to smooth out changes.
6.  **Network-Aware LOD Selection:** LOD (Level of Detail) selection isnâ€™t solely based on distance. Network conditions directly influence the chosen LOD.  A weak connection forces a more aggressive reduction in detail, even for nearby objects.
7.  **Client-Side Fallback:** If a service request fails completely (due to network outage), the client automatically substitutes a pre-rendered or simplified local version of the object.
8. **Rendering Pipeline Integration:** This system will need to integrate at the lowest levels of the rendering pipeline - shader compilation, mesh loading, texture streaming, and draw call generation.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Prediction Loop):**

```
loop:
  frame_stats = get_current_frame_stats()
  network_stats = get_network_stats()
  scene_graph = get_current_scene_graph()

  risk_scores = predict_risk_scores(frame_stats, network_stats, scene_graph)

  for node in scene_graph:
    if risk_scores[node] > threshold:
      simplified_node = get_simplified_version(node)
      replace_node(node, simplified_node)

  render_scene()
```
