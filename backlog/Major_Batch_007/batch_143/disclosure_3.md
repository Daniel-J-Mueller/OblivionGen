## Adaptive Biometric Key Orchestration for Decentralized Identity

**System Overview:**

This system expands upon the biometric authentication concept by integrating it with a decentralized identity (DID) framework and dynamic key derivation. Instead of a static key pair, the system utilizes a constantly rotating set of cryptographic keys derived from a biometric “seed” and contextual factors.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Enhanced Biometric Sensor Array:** Multi-modal biometric input (fingerprint, iris, facial features, voice analysis) captured via a dedicated, secure hardware module.
*   **Secure Enclave:** Tamper-resistant hardware element housing the biometric seed, key derivation functions, and encryption/decryption processes.
*   **Network Interface:**  Connectivity for DID resolution, secure communication with remote servers, and blockchain interaction (if applicable).
*   **Contextual Data Sensors:**  Integration with sensors providing contextual data (location, time, device posture, network environment).

**Software Components:**

*   **Biometric Seed Generator:**  Algorithm that converts raw biometric data into a secure, pseudo-random seed.
*   **Key Derivation Function (KDF):**  HMAC-based KDF that generates unique cryptographic keys based on the biometric seed, contextual data, and a counter.
*   **DID Resolver:**  Software component for resolving Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and retrieving associated public keys.
*   **Secure Communication Module:**  Utilizes TLS 1.3 or a similar protocol for establishing secure communication channels.
*   **Adaptive Authentication Engine:**  Orchestrates the entire authentication process, managing key rotation, biometric verification, and communication with remote servers.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Enrollment:** User provides biometric data. The Biometric Seed Generator creates a seed stored in the Secure Enclave. A DID is generated and associated with the user account.
2.  **Authentication Request:** When an application requires authentication, the Adaptive Authentication Engine initiates the process.
3.  **Biometric Verification:** The user provides biometric input. The Secure Enclave verifies the input against the stored seed.
4.  **Key Derivation:**  Based on the verified biometric data, current context (time, location, etc.), and a rotating counter, the KDF generates a unique key pair. The private key remains within the Secure Enclave.
5.  **DID Resolution:** The system resolves the DID associated with the remote server to obtain its public key.
6.  **Encrypted Communication:**  The private key is used to encrypt authentication data. This encrypted data is sent to the remote server.
7.  **Server Verification:**  The server decrypts the data using its associated DID’s public key. Successful decryption confirms the user’s identity.
8.  **Key Rotation:**  After each authentication cycle (or at regular intervals), the counter is incremented, generating a new set of keys.  Old keys are archived for auditing.

**Pseudocode (Key Derivation Function):**

```
function derive_key(biometric_seed, context_data, counter):
    // Combine biometric seed, contextual data, and counter
    combined_data = concatenate(biometric_seed, context_data, counter)

    // Use HMAC-SHA256 for key derivation
    hmac = HMAC_SHA256(secret_key, combined_data)

    // Derive the private key
    private_key = truncate(hmac, 32) // 256-bit key

    // Derive the public key (using ECC or RSA) - not implemented

    return private_key
```

**Contextual Data Examples:**

*   **Location:** GPS coordinates or network-based location.
*   **Time:** Current timestamp.
*   **Device Posture:** Screen orientation, motion sensors.
*   **Network Environment:** Wi-Fi SSID, network type.
*   **Application Context:**  Specific application requesting authentication.



**Novelty:** This design moves beyond static key pairs and introduces a dynamic, context-aware authentication system. The integration with decentralized identity enhances privacy and security. The continuous key rotation mitigates the risk of key compromise.
