## Adaptive Resolution & Predictive Editing for Multi-User Collaborative Environments

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of applying lower-resolution edits to higher-resolution content, but focus on *dynamic* resolution adjustment based on user network conditions and *predictive* application of edits before full resolution data is received. Target: real-time collaborative video editing where participants have vastly different bandwidth.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** 'Resolution-Aware Edit Pipeline'
*   **Input:** Video stream (potentially multiple streams from different users) with initial, potentially low, resolution. Edit commands from any user. Network bandwidth estimates for all connected users.
*   **Output:** Edited video stream, dynamically adjusted per user to maximize quality given their bandwidth.

**Modules & Functionality:**

1.  **Bandwidth Profiler:**
    *   Continuously monitors network conditions of each connected user (ping, packet loss, throughput).
    *   Establishes baseline bandwidth for each user, with continuous adjustment.
    *   Flags users experiencing degradation in bandwidth.

2.  **Adaptive Resolution Engine:**
    *   Maintains multiple resolution layers of the video content (e.g., 240p, 480p, 720p, 1080p, 4k).
    *   Dynamically selects the appropriate resolution layer for each user based on their bandwidth profile.
    *   Algorithm prioritizes smooth playback over absolute highest resolution.  A user experiencing packet loss might be temporarily *downscaled* to a lower resolution.

3.  **Predictive Edit Application:**
    *   When a user applies an edit (e.g., color correction, transition, effect), the system analyzes the edit's complexity.
    *   For simple edits, apply the edit to *all* resolution layers immediately.
    *   For complex edits (e.g., particle effects, 3D rendering), the system *predicts* how the edit will appear at higher resolutions based on the lower-resolution data.
    *   A neural network (trained on a dataset of edits at various resolutions) estimates the higher-resolution output.
    *   Send the predicted high-resolution output as a preview to other users.

4.  **Edit Conflict Resolution:**
    *   Real-time collaborative editing can lead to conflicts.
    *   Implement a system of “edit tokens” or “ownership” where users temporarily lock portions of the timeline during editing.
    *   Visual indicators for locked/edited portions.
    *   System automatically merges concurrent edits where possible.
    *   For conflicting edits, present options to the users (e.g., accept changes, revert, blend).

5.  **Progressive Refinement:**
    *   As higher-resolution data becomes available (or is rendered), progressively refine the video quality.
    *   Use techniques like super-resolution to enhance the perceived quality.
    *   Smooth transitions between resolution layers.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Edit Application):**

```
function applyEdit(editCommand, currentResolution, targetResolution) {
  if (editCommand.complexity == "simple") {
    // Apply edit to all resolutions immediately
    applyToAllResolutions(editCommand);
  } else {
    // Complex edit – predict high-resolution output
    lowResOutput = applyEditToLowRes(editCommand, currentResolution);
    highResPrediction = neuralNetwork.predictHighRes(lowResOutput, targetResolution);
    sendPreviewToUsers(highResPrediction);
    //Asynchronously render full resolution and replace prediction.
    renderFullResolution(editCommand, highResPrediction);
  }
}

function renderFullResolution(editCommand, preview){
   //Render the final version.
   //Send update to all clients.
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Powerful server infrastructure for video processing and rendering.
*   GPU acceleration for neural network inference.
*   Low-latency network connectivity.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   AI-powered automatic edit suggestions.
*   Integration with cloud storage for asset management.
*   Support for virtual reality/augmented reality editing.
*   Real-time collaboration on 3D scenes.
