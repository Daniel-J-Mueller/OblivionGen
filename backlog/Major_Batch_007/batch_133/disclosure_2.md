## Adaptive Request Shaping via Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the token bucket system to not just *react* to capacity usage, but *predict* future needs based on historical request patterns and dynamically adjust token refill rates and bucket sizes *before* potential congestion. This moves beyond prioritization to proactive resource allocation, optimizing for both throughput and latency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Historical Data Collection & Analysis Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Logs of all requests (request class, operation type, resource consumption – CPU, memory, I/O, network), system metrics (CPU utilization, memory pressure, disk I/O, network bandwidth), time of day, day of week, seasonality.
*   **Analysis Techniques:** Time series analysis (ARIMA, Prophet), machine learning models (Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory – LSTM) to forecast resource consumption per request class over various time horizons (short-term – next minute, medium-term – next hour, long-term – next day).  Emphasis on anomaly detection to identify unexpected request patterns.
*   **Output:**  Predicted resource consumption profiles for each request class, confidence intervals, anomaly flags.

**2. Dynamic Token Bucket Configuration Module:**

*   **Input:** Predicted resource consumption profiles from the Historical Data Collection & Analysis Module, current token bucket status (capacity, refill rate), overall system capacity.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Calculate Target Refill Rate:**  For each request class, determine the optimal refill rate based on the predicted resource consumption. This rate should be high enough to accommodate expected requests, but not so high as to exceed overall system capacity.  Consider a safety margin.
    2.  **Dynamic Bucket Sizing:**  Adjust the token bucket capacity based on the variance in predicted request patterns.  Higher variance implies a need for a larger bucket to buffer bursts.  A 'base' bucket size is pre-defined, and scaled up or down dynamically.
    3.  **Capacity Allocation Prioritization:**  In cases where overall system capacity is limited, a hierarchical allocation scheme is used.  Critical request classes (determined by configuration or a separate scoring system) receive priority, with lower-priority classes potentially experiencing rate limiting.
    4.  **Feedback Loop:**  Monitor the actual resource consumption vs. predicted consumption. Use the difference to refine the prediction models and adjust refill rates in real-time.

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   **Data Storage:**  Time series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus) to efficiently store and query historical data.
*   **Model Training:**  Periodic retraining of machine learning models (e.g., nightly) to adapt to changing request patterns.  Online learning techniques can be used for real-time adaptation.
*   **API Integration:**  Expose an API for external systems to query predicted resource consumption and adjust request rates.
*   **Configuration:**  Comprehensive configuration options for tuning prediction algorithms, refill rates, bucket sizes, and prioritization schemes.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Refill Rate Calculation):**

```
function calculate_refill_rate(request_class, predicted_consumption, current_capacity, total_system_capacity):
  # predicted_consumption: Estimated resource usage for this class in the next time window
  # current_capacity: Current available capacity in the token bucket for this class
  # total_system_capacity: Overall system capacity
  
  base_refill_rate = predicted_consumption / time_window_duration
  
  # Apply safety margin (e.g., 20%)
  safety_margin = 0.2
  adjusted_refill_rate = base_refill_rate * (1 + safety_margin)
  
  # Limit refill rate based on overall system capacity
  max_refill_rate = total_system_capacity * 0.8  # Reserve some capacity for unexpected spikes
  
  final_refill_rate = min(adjusted_refill_rate, max_refill_rate)
  
  return final_refill_rate
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Multi-Tenancy Support:**  Extend the system to support multiple tenants, with dedicated resource allocations and prioritization schemes.
*   **Automated Scaling:**  Integrate with autoscaling infrastructure to dynamically adjust system capacity based on predicted demand.
*   **Proactive Alerting:**  Generate alerts when predicted resource consumption exceeds predefined thresholds.
