## Adaptive Media Segmentation & Collaborative "Worldbuilding"

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple comment association with media sections to enable users to collaboratively *remix* and *extend* the original content, essentially building a "world" around it. This utilizes the existing sectioning/commenting framework as a launchpad for user-generated content integration.

**Specs:**

**1. Adaptive Segmentation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Digital media item (video, audio, text, images).
*   **Process:**  Automatically analyze media for distinct "segments" beyond user-defined sections. This leverages AI to identify shifts in topic, mood, visual style, etc.  Output a dynamic segmentation map.  Segment length is variable.
*   **Output:**  A data structure representing segments, including:
    *   Segment ID
    *   Start/End Time/Position
    *   AI-derived tags (e.g., "Action," "Dialogue," "Suspense," "Landscape")
    *   Confidence Score (indicating reliability of AI tags)
    *   User-defined section mappings (linking existing user sections to AI segments)

**2. User-Generated Content Integration Layer:**

*   **Content Types:** Support for text, images, audio, video, 3D models, and simple interactive elements (e.g., polls, quizzes).
*   **Attachment Points:** Users can attach content to *any* segment (AI-derived or user-defined).  Multiple attachments per segment.
*   **Attachment Types:**
    *   **"Expansion":**  Extends the original segment –  e.g., adding a scene to a video, continuing a story, providing additional context.
    *   **"Interpretation":**  Provides commentary or analysis –  e.g., a video essay, a character profile, a thematic breakdown.
    *   **"Remix":**  Transforms the segment –  e.g., a musical remix, a visual reinterpretation, a parody.
    *   **"Worldbuilding":**  Adds entirely new content that builds upon the segment’s themes or setting – e.g., a map of a location, a backstory of a character, a fictional news report.

**3.  Interactive User Interface:**

*   **Layered Timeline:** Display the original media alongside a layered timeline of user-generated content. Users can toggle layers on/off to view different perspectives.
*   **Segment "Bubbles":**  Visually represent segments as bubbles on the timeline. Bubble size/color indicates the amount/type of attached content.
*   **"World View":** A dedicated view that aggregates all user-generated content related to a specific segment or theme, creating a comprehensive “world” around the media.
*   **Spatial Audio/Visual Integration:** (Advanced) If the original media contains spatial audio/video, attempt to integrate user-generated content into the same space (e.g., adding sound effects or visual elements to a 360-degree video).

**4.  Algorithmic Curation & Discovery:**

*   **“Worldbuilding Score”:**  Assign a score to each segment based on the quality and quantity of user-generated content.
*   **Recommendation Engine:**  Recommend segments and “worlds” to users based on their interests and viewing history.
*   **“Emergent Narrative” Detection:**  Analyze user-generated content to identify emergent narratives or themes.

**Pseudocode (Curation Engine):**

```
function calculateWorldbuildingScore(segment) {
  score = 0;
  //Weight for quantity of UGC
  quantityWeight = 0.3
  //Weight for quality of UGC (likes, comments, views, etc)
  qualityWeight = 0.7

  score += (segment.UGC.length * quantityWeight);
  for each UGC in segment.UGC {
    score += (UGC.likes + UGC.comments) * qualityWeight;
  }
  return score;
}

function recommendSegments(user) {
  segments = database.getSegments();
  for each segment in segments {
    segment.worldbuildingScore = calculateWorldbuildingScore(segment);
  }
  segments.sort(by: worldbuildingScore, descending: true);
  return segments.first(10); //return top 10
}
```

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond simple commenting/annotation to create a collaborative, persistent, and evolving “world” around the original media. Focuses on *creation* and *expansion* rather than just *interpretation*.  The algorithmically curated “Worldbuilding Score” and “Emergent Narrative” detection add a layer of discovery and engagement.
