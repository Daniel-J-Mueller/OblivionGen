## Dynamic Subnet Morphing for Adaptive Security Zones

**Concept:** Expand the existing subnetwork isolation concept to create dynamically morphing security zones based on real-time threat analysis and application behavior. Instead of static subnets, allow the system to *re-allocate* virtual machines between subnets in response to detected anomalies or changing security needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Threat Intelligence Feed Integration:** Integrate with multiple threat intelligence feeds (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX) to monitor for known malicious IPs, domains, and malware signatures.
*   **Behavioral Anomaly Detection:** Implement machine learning models to establish baseline behavior for applications and VMs. Deviations from this baseline (e.g., unusual network traffic, process execution) trigger investigation and potential isolation.
*   **Dynamic Subnet Allocation Engine:**
    *   Input: Threat intelligence, behavioral anomaly scores, application criticality.
    *   Output:  Instructions to move VMs between subnets.
    *   Logic:
        *   High Threat Score/Severe Anomaly: Immediately move VM to a “quarantine” subnet with restricted access.
        *   Moderate Threat Score/Anomaly: Move VM to a “monitoring” subnet with increased logging and traffic inspection.
        *   Normal Behavior: Maintain VM in its current subnet.
*   **Virtual Firewall Adaptation:** The virtual firewall configuration must dynamically adjust to reflect VM movements between subnets. Rules should be automatically updated to permit/deny traffic based on the VM’s current security zone.
*   **Traffic Mirroring & Analysis:** Implement traffic mirroring to send copies of network traffic to a dedicated analysis appliance. This appliance can perform deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, and malware analysis.
*   **Automated Remediation:** Implement automated remediation actions, such as isolating infected VMs, blocking malicious IPs, and patching vulnerabilities.
*   **API Integration:** Expose an API to allow external security tools and systems to integrate with the dynamic subnet morphing system.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Subnet Allocation Engine):**

```
function allocate_subnet(VM, threat_score, anomaly_score, criticality):
  if threat_score > 90:
    subnet = "quarantine"
    firewall_rule = "deny all except essential services"
  elif anomaly_score > 70:
    subnet = "monitoring"
    firewall_rule = "increased logging and inspection"
  else:
    subnet = current_subnet(VM)
    firewall_rule = current_firewall_rule(VM)

  move_vm_to_subnet(VM, subnet)
  update_firewall_rule(VM, firewall_rule)

  return subnet
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   High-performance network switches capable of VLAN tagging and dynamic routing.
*   Virtualization platform with support for live migration of VMs between hosts.
*   Firewall with API access and support for dynamic rule updates.
*   Machine learning platform for anomaly detection.
*   Threat intelligence feed subscriptions.
*   Dedicated security analysis appliance.
