## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Profiling for Proactive Assistance

**Specification:**

**I. System Overview:**

The system aims to move beyond simple wakeword detection to understand *where* the user is and *what* they are likely doing, proactively adjusting device behavior and assistance features. It leverages continuous audio analysis, not just for wake words, but for acoustic scene classification *before* a direct command is given.

**II. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** Minimum of four microphones, spatially distributed to facilitate sound source localization and noise reduction.
*   **Low-Power Audio Front-End (AFE):** Dedicated hardware for pre-processing audio signals – noise reduction, automatic gain control, beamforming.
*   **Edge TPU/NPU:** Dedicated neural processing unit for on-device acoustic scene classification and initial command parsing.
*   **General Purpose Processor:** For higher-level logic, cloud communication (if needed), and controlling device functionality.
*   **Haptic Feedback Module:** For subtle user notifications.

**III. Software Modules:**

1.  **Continuous Acoustic Scene Classifier (CASC):**
    *   Trained on a diverse dataset of acoustic scenes (home, office, car, outdoors, gym, etc.).  Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with attention mechanisms to focus on salient audio features.
    *   Outputs a probability distribution over possible acoustic scenes.
    *   Runs continuously in the background, consuming minimal power.
    *   Adaptive learning:  Refines scene classification based on user behavior (location data, calendar events, app usage).

2.  **Proactive Assistance Engine (PAE):**
    *   Receives scene probabilities from CASC.
    *   Maintains a knowledge base of context-aware assistance rules. (e.g., "If scene = 'car' and time = morning', suggest navigation to 'work'").
    *   Predicts likely user needs *before* a command is given.
    *   Triggers subtle haptic feedback to indicate predicted assistance (e.g., a gentle pulse if navigation is suggested).

3.  **Hybrid Wake Word/Intent Recognizer:**
    *   Traditional wake word detection (using the patent’s approach) still present.
    *   If wake word is detected, the system combines wake word detection with the output of the PAE to predict user intent more accurately.
    *   This reduces latency and improves the quality of voice commands.

**IV. Operational Flow:**

1.  Audio is continuously captured by the microphone array.
2.  The AFE pre-processes the audio.
3.  The CASC classifies the acoustic scene.
4.  The PAE predicts likely user needs based on the scene and context.
5.  Subtle haptic feedback indicates predicted assistance.
6.  If the wake word is detected, the system combines wake word detection with the PAE's prediction to interpret user intent.
7.  The system executes the command or provides relevant information.

**V. Pseudocode - Proactive Assistance Engine:**

```pseudocode
// Data Structures:
SceneProbability: Dictionary (SceneName: Float)
ContextData: Dictionary (Location: String, Time: String, CalendarEvent: String, AppUsage: String)
AssistanceRules: List (Rule: Dictionary (SceneName: String, ContextData: Dictionary, SuggestedAction: String))

// Function: ProcessScene
Function ProcessScene(SceneProbability, ContextData, AssistanceRules):
    BestScene = FindKeyWithMaxValue(SceneProbability)
    MatchingRules = Filter(AssistanceRules, Rule.SceneName == BestScene AND Rule.ContextData == ContextData)

    If MatchingRules IsNotEmpty:
        SuggestedAction = MatchingRules[0].SuggestedAction
        ProvideHapticFeedback(SuggestedAction) // Subtle pulse or vibration
    End If
End Function
```

**VI. Power Management:**

*   CASC runs at a low duty cycle.
*   Scene classification thresholds can be adjusted dynamically to balance accuracy and power consumption.
*   The system uses event-driven processing to minimize CPU usage.
*   Leverage microphone power gating techniques.

**VII. Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with smart home devices to automate tasks based on predicted needs.
*   Personalized assistance based on user preferences and historical data.
*   Acoustic event detection (e.g., detecting a baby crying or a door slamming) to trigger specific actions.
*   Multi-user support.
