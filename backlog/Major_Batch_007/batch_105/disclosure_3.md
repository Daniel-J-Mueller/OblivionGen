## Adaptive Resonance Thermal Mapping & Predictive Failure Analysis

**Concept:** Expand the bond state detection beyond simple weakening/separation. Utilize thermal signatures as a primary diagnostic, combined with a self-organizing map (SOM) for anomaly detection, and predictive failure analysis incorporating environmental variables.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution thermal camera integrated into the monitoring device (resolution: 64x64 pixels minimum).
    *   Environmental sensor suite: ambient temperature, humidity, vibration (accelerometer).
    *   Existing processor/memory infrastructure from the core patent.
    *   Optional: small, localized heating element controllable by the system to perform active thermal testing.
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Thermal Baseline Establishment (Commissioning Phase):**
        1.  Collect thermal data from the monitoring device for a defined period (e.g., 72 hours) during normal industrial device operation.
        2.  Process thermal images: noise reduction, normalization, feature extraction (e.g., mean temperature, temperature gradients, thermal variance).
        3.  Train a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). Each node on the SOM represents a 'thermal state' of the bond. The SOM learns the distribution of normal thermal signatures.
    *   **Real-time Monitoring & Anomaly Detection:**
        1.  Continuously capture thermal data & environmental variables.
        2.  Process thermal images as in baseline establishment.
        3.  Map the current thermal signature onto the trained SOM.
        4.  Calculate the 'distance' between the current thermal state and its nearest SOM node. A threshold distance indicates an anomaly.
    *   **Predictive Failure Analysis:**
        1.  Log all anomalies, environmental data, and industrial device operating parameters (if accessible).
        2.  Utilize a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM neural network) to predict the future distance to the nearest SOM node. Increasing distance predicts bond degradation.
        3.  Factor in environmental variables (temperature cycles, humidity, vibration) as influencing factors in the forecasting model.
        4.  Output a "Bond Health Score" (0-100) based on the predicted future distance and environmental factors.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Historical thermal images.
    *   SOM weight matrix.
    *   Anomaly logs.
    *   Time-series forecasting model parameters.
    *   Bond Health Scores.
*   **Alerting:**
    *   Configurable alert thresholds for Bond Health Score and anomaly distance.
    *   Alerts include historical thermal images, current conditions, and predicted future degradation.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
FUNCTION DetectAnomaly(thermal_image, environmental_data):
  // Preprocess thermal image
  processed_image = PreprocessThermalImage(thermal_image)

  // Map to SOM
  winning_node = FindWinningNode(processed_image, SOM_weights)

  // Calculate distance to winning node
  distance = CalculateDistance(processed_image, SOM_weights[winning_node])

  // Check against threshold
  IF distance > anomaly_threshold:
    RETURN TRUE // Anomaly detected
  ELSE:
    RETURN FALSE // No anomaly detected
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond simple bond detection to a predictive health monitoring system. By using thermal signatures and a SOM, the system can identify subtle changes in bond state before they become critical failures. The inclusion of environmental factors improves the accuracy of the predictive models.
