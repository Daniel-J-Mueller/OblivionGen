## Adaptive Wakeword Sensitivity Based on User Emotional State

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic wakeword detection threshold concept by incorporating real-time analysis of the user's emotional state derived from audio or visual input to *proactively* adjust wakeword sensitivity.  The goal is to create a truly ‘contextually aware’ voice assistant – one that understands *how* you’re saying something, not just *what* you’re saying.

**Specifications:**

**I. Input Modalities & Data Acquisition:**

*   **Audio Analysis:** Employ a real-time audio analysis module capable of extracting prosodic features (pitch, tone, speech rate, intensity variations).  Implement a pre-trained emotion recognition model (e.g., using a recurrent neural network or transformer architecture) to classify the user’s emotional state into categories like “neutral,” “happy,” “frustrated,” “urgent,” “calm,” etc.  Confidence scores should be generated for each emotional state.
*   **Visual Analysis (Optional):** Integrate a camera module and facial expression recognition software. This module should be able to detect key facial features and infer emotional states with confidence scores.  This is a supplementary input; the system should function effectively with audio alone.
*   **Data Fusion:** A fusion algorithm (weighted averaging or a more sophisticated Bayesian network) combines audio and visual emotional data to create a unified emotional state representation. Weights should be adjustable based on the reliability of each modality (e.g., prioritize audio if visual data is poor).

**II. Wakeword Sensitivity Adjustment Logic:**

*   **Emotional State Mapping:** Define a mapping between emotional states and wakeword sensitivity levels. Examples:
    *   **Urgent/Frustrated:**  *Reduce* wakeword detection threshold significantly – prioritize responsiveness. A slightly imperfect detection is preferable to missing a critical request.
    *   **Calm/Neutral:** Maintain default wakeword detection threshold.
    *   **Happy/Excited:**  *Increase* wakeword detection threshold slightly – to avoid accidental activations from louder, more energetic speech.
    *   **Sad/Low Energy:** *Reduce* threshold, anticipating softer, potentially less distinct speech.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm:**
    1.  Receive real-time emotional state data (from Data Fusion).
    2.  Lookup corresponding sensitivity level in the Emotional State Mapping.
    3.  Smoothly transition the wakeword detection threshold to the new level using a linear or exponential smoothing function. This prevents jarring sensitivity changes.
    4.  Continuously monitor emotional state and adjust the threshold in real-time.
*   **Personalization:** Implement a machine learning component that learns individual user emotional baselines and adapts the Emotional State Mapping accordingly.  The system should understand that ‘frustration’ manifests differently for each user.  Use reinforcement learning; reward the system when it correctly responds to a user’s intent while respecting the inferred emotional state.

**III. System Architecture:**

*   **Modules:**
    *   Audio Input Module
    *   Visual Input Module (Optional)
    *   Emotion Recognition Module (trained model)
    *   Data Fusion Module
    *   Wakeword Detection Module (existing)
    *   Sensitivity Adjustment Module (new)
    *   Machine Learning/Personalization Module (new)
*   **Data Flow:**  Audio/Visual Input -> Emotion Recognition/Data Fusion -> Sensitivity Adjustment -> Wakeword Detection.
*   **Hardware:**  Microphone array, optional camera, onboard processor with sufficient computational power for real-time analysis.

**IV. Pseudocode (Sensitivity Adjustment Module):**

```
function adjustSensitivity(emotionalState, confidenceScore):
  // Lookup sensitivity level based on emotional state
  sensitivityLevel = emotionMapping[emotionalState]

  // Apply confidence weighting
  adjustedSensitivity = sensitivityLevel * confidenceScore

  // Smooth transition to new sensitivity level
  newThreshold = alpha * currentThreshold + (1 - alpha) * adjustedSensitivity
  setWakewordThreshold(newThreshold)

  return newThreshold
```

(Where `alpha` is a smoothing factor between 0 and 1)
