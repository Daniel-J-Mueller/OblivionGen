## Multi-Band Adaptive Parasitic Array

**Concept:** Expand upon the parasitic element concept to create a dynamically reconfigurable antenna array capable of beam steering and polarization control without mechanical movement. This system moves beyond a single parasitic element to multiple, individually tunable parasitic resonators.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Components:**
    *   Driven Element: A modified version of the antenna element described in the provided patent, acting as the primary radiator.
    *   Parasitic Resonator Array: A grid of microstrip patch resonators, each acting as a parasitic element. Minimum array size: 8x8. Individual element size: approximately 5mm x 5mm at 2.4 GHz.
    *   Tunable Varactors: Each parasitic resonator incorporates a voltage-controlled varactor diode integrated into the patch itself.  Range: 1-10 pF.
    *   Control Circuitry: A dedicated microcontroller (e.g., ESP32) manages varactor voltages, implementing beam steering and polarization control algorithms.
    *   Feed Network: A hybrid coupler or Wilkinson power divider distributes RF power to the driven element.
    *   Ground Plane: A solid ground plane providing a reference for the antenna structure.

*   **Operational Principles:**
    *   **Beam Steering:** By precisely controlling the capacitance of individual parasitic elements, the phase and amplitude of the reflected RF signal are modified. This creates constructive and destructive interference patterns, steering the main beam direction.
    *   **Polarization Control:**  Asymmetrical tuning of parasitic elements alters the polarization of the radiated signal, enabling both linear and circular polarization.
    *   **Frequency Agility:**  The resonant frequencies of the parasitic elements can be adjusted dynamically, providing bandwidth enhancement and multi-band operation.

*   **Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
// Beam Steering Algorithm
function steerBeam(angleX, angleY):
  // Calculate phase shift required for each parasitic element
  for each element in array:
    distanceX = element.x - center.x
    distanceY = element.y - center.y
    phaseShift = (angleX * distanceX + angleY * distanceY) * waveNumber
    // Convert phase shift to capacitance required
    capacitance = calculateCapacitance(phaseShift)
    // Set varactor voltage to achieve desired capacitance
    setVaractorVoltage(element, capacitance)

// Polarization Control Algorithm
function setPolarization(type, angle):
  if (type == "linear"):
    // Calculate capacitance difference between adjacent elements
    // Adjust varactor voltages accordingly
  else if (type == "circular"):
    // Calculate capacitance difference and phase shift
    // Adjust varactor voltages accordingly
```

*   **Materials:**
    *   Substrate: Rogers RO4350B (or equivalent) with a dielectric constant of 3.27 and a thickness of 0.813 mm.
    *   Conductive Layer: Copper (1 oz).
    *   Varactor Diodes: Skyworks SMS7630-079LF.

*   **Integration:**  The parasitic resonator array can be fabricated using standard PCB manufacturing techniques. The control circuitry and feed network are integrated onto the same PCB.  A c-clip connector provides the RF interface.

* **Future Considerations:** Implementation of a machine learning algorithm to dynamically optimize varactor voltages for maximum signal strength and beam forming performance. Exploration of alternative tuning mechanisms such as MEMS switches or digital attenuators.
