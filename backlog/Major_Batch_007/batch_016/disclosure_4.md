## Dynamic Complexity Budgeting & Procedural Asset Streaming

**Concept:** Expand the cost-based graphics command generation to incorporate a dynamic complexity budget managed *per-scene* and leverage procedural asset generation & streaming to fulfill visual requirements within that budget. 

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on offloading rendering tasks based on object complexity. This builds on that by not just *reacting* to complexity, but proactively *managing* it through budget allocation and dynamically generating assets to fit.  This creates a system where scenes can scale from low-poly mobile experiences to high-fidelity desktop visuals without requiring pre-authored assets for every possibility.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Scene Complexity Budget:**
    *   Each scene instance (e.g., a level in a game, a specific view in a VR application) receives a complexity budget expressed as a quantifiable metric (e.g., triangle count, shader instruction count, texture memory usage).
    *   This budget is adjustable at runtime based on client device capabilities, network conditions, and user preferences (quality settings).
    *   The budget is *not* evenly distributed. Certain areas or objects within the scene receive priority weighting (e.g., the player character, points of interest).

2.  **Procedural Asset Generation Service:**
    *   An extended version of the existing graphics object service.
    *   Accepts requests for assets described by:
        *   Semantic description (e.g., "medieval wooden table," "stylized pine tree," "damaged concrete wall").
        *   Complexity constraint (maximum triangle count, texture resolution, shader complexity).
        *   Style parameters (e.g., “low-poly,” “realistic,” “cartoonish”).
    *   Utilizes procedural generation algorithms (e.g., L-systems, fractal geometry, noise functions) to create assets on demand.
    *   Can leverage pre-authored base meshes and textures as building blocks for procedural generation.

3.  **Asset Streaming & Caching:**
    *   Generated assets are streamed to the client as needed.
    *   A client-side cache stores frequently used assets to reduce latency and network bandwidth usage.
    *   Assets are prioritized for streaming based on their visual importance and proximity to the viewer.

4.  **Runtime Complexity Monitoring & Adjustment:**
    *   The client continuously monitors the complexity of the rendered scene.
    *   If the complexity exceeds the budget, the system dynamically adjusts the level of detail (LOD) of existing assets, or requests lower-complexity versions of new assets from the procedural generation service.
    *   The system can also dynamically adjust the number of objects rendered in the scene, or simplify the geometry of complex objects.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function RenderScene(sceneComplexityBudget) {

  // Initialize asset cache

  // For each object in scene {

    // Calculate object's base complexity cost

    // Check if object asset is in cache
    if (assetInCache) {
        useCachedAsset()
    } else {
        // Request asset from procedural generation service
        assetRequest = createAssetRequest(objectDescription, complexityBudget)
        sendRequest(assetRequest)

        // Handle response (asset received or error)
        onAssetReceived(asset) {
            cacheAsset(asset)
            renderAsset(asset)
        }
    }

    // Calculate total scene complexity
    totalComplexity = sumOfObjectComplexities()

    // If total complexity exceeds budget
    if (totalComplexity > sceneComplexityBudget) {

        // Prioritize objects for simplification (based on distance to viewer, importance, etc.)
        prioritizedObjects = prioritizeObjects(objects)

        // Simplify or remove objects until complexity is within budget
        for each object in prioritizedObjects {
            if (complexityStillExceedsBudget()) {
                simplifyObject(object) // Reduce polygon count, texture resolution, etc.
                if(objectComplexityIsZero()){
                    removeObjectFromScene(object)
                }
            }
        }
    }

  }

  renderSceneComponents()

}
```

**Engineer Notes:**

*   The procedural generation algorithms should be highly optimized for performance. Consider using GPU-based procedural generation techniques.
*   The asset streaming system should be robust and fault-tolerant.
*   The client-side complexity monitoring system should be accurate and efficient.
*   Consider integrating with existing asset pipelines to allow for the use of pre-authored assets in addition to procedurally generated assets.
*   Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms to handle cases where procedural generation fails or assets cannot be streamed.
