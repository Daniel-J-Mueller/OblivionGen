**Personalized Offer ‘Chaining’ with Dynamic URI Generation**

**Concept:** Expand upon the signed URI system to create a dynamic offer ‘chain’ where redeeming one offer automatically generates a new, personalized signed URI for a related (or even unrelated) offer, fostering continued engagement. This is distinct from simply offering a 'next' offer; it's about building a dynamic, personalized sequence triggered by user action.

**Specifications:**

*   **URI Structure:** Extend the existing signed URI to include a ‘chain ID’ and ‘link number’.
    *   `https://example.com/offer?chainID=[unique_chain_identifier]&link=[current_link_number]&userID=[user_identifier]&offerID=[offer_identifier]&signature=[cryptographic_signature]`
*   **Chain Generation Module:** A new module responsible for constructing offer chains. Input parameters: user profile data, purchase history, browsing behavior, current offers, desired chain length, acceptable offer relevance score.
*   **Relevance Scoring Algorithm:** A scoring system to determine how well an offer fits the user’s profile *and* the preceding offer in the chain. (e.g. User buys coffee -> Next offer is for a pastry -> High relevance). Algorithms could be weighted for different categories.
*   **Dynamic Signature Generation:** Upon offer redemption, the system *automatically* generates a new signed URI.
    1.  The Chain Generation Module evaluates available offers and selects the highest-scoring offer based on the user’s profile and the just-redeemed offer.
    2.  A new URI is constructed with an incremented ‘link’ number and the ID of the new offer.
    3.  The cryptographic signature is generated based on the updated data.
    4.  The new URI is presented to the user (e.g., via email, push notification, in-app message) or pre-loaded as a redirect.
*   **Chain Length Control:** A configurable parameter to limit the maximum length of an offer chain. Prevents infinite loops or overly aggressive promotion.
*   **Chain Interruption Logic:** Conditions under which a chain is automatically terminated (e.g., user ignores multiple offers, chain reaches maximum length, user explicitly opts out).
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/chain/generate?userID=[user_identifier]&chainID=[chain_identifier]`: Returns the next signed URI in the chain.
    *   `/chain/create?userID=[user_identifier]`: Initiates a new offer chain.
    *   `/chain/interrupt?chainID=[chain_identifier]&userID=[user_identifier]`: Terminates a specific chain for a user.

**Pseudocode (Chain Generation Module):**

```
function generate_next_offer(userID, chainID):
  user_profile = get_user_profile(userID)
  last_offer = get_last_offer_in_chain(chainID)
  candidate_offers = get_eligible_offers(user_profile)
  scored_offers = []

  for offer in candidate_offers:
    relevance_score = calculate_relevance_score(user_profile, last_offer, offer)
    scored_offers.append((offer, relevance_score))

  scored_offers.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

  if scored_offers:
    next_offer = scored_offers[0][0]
    new_chain_link = get_next_chain_link_number(chainID)
    new_uri = generate_signed_uri(user_id, next_offer.offer_id, chainID, new_chain_link)
    return new_uri
  else:
    return null  // No suitable offers found
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **A/B Testing:** Experiment with different chain lengths, offer selection algorithms, and presentation methods to optimize engagement.
*   **Predictive Chain Generation:** Use machine learning to predict which offers a user is most likely to redeem and proactively generate chains tailored to their individual preferences.
*   **Gamification:** Incorporate game mechanics (e.g., badges, points, leaderboards) to incentivize users to complete entire offer chains.
