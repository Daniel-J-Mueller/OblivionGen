## Dynamic Proximity-Based Content Delivery System

**Concept:** Extend geo-dynamic email lists to encompass *any* digital content – not just emails – and deliver it based on nuanced proximity definitions beyond simple location. Introduce ‘Content Zones’ and ‘Behavioral Radii’ to customize delivery.

**Specs:**

*   **Content Zones:** Defined geographic areas (polygons, circles, etc.) associated with specific digital content. Content can be anything: promotional offers, augmented reality experiences, localized news feeds, interactive games, or access to venue-specific services.
*   **Behavioral Radii:** Define zones around points of interest (POI) not based on distance, but on *observed user behavior*. Examples:
    *   *‘Lingering Radius’*: User remains within a small area for >5 minutes.
    *   *‘Approach Radius’*: User is approaching a POI at a speed suggesting intent to visit.
    *   *‘Exit Radius’*: User has left a defined area.
*   **Content Management System (CMS):** A central system to define Content Zones, Behavioral Radii, and associated digital content. The CMS must support:
    *   Content scheduling (time-based or event-triggered).
    *   A/B testing of different content variations.
    *   Real-time analytics (content impressions, engagement rates, conversions).
*   **User App:** A mobile application (or SDK for integration into existing apps) that:
    *   Collects location data (GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth beacons).
    *   Monitors user behavior (speed, direction, dwell time).
    *   Communicates with the content delivery server.
    *   Handles content rendering (AR overlays, web page links, app notifications).
*   **Content Delivery Server:** A server-side component that:
    *   Receives location and behavior data from user apps.
    *   Determines which Content Zones and Behavioral Radii the user is within.
    *   Selects the appropriate digital content from the CMS.
    *   Delivers the content to the user app.

**Pseudocode (Content Delivery Server):**

```
function handleUserLocationUpdate(userId, latitude, longitude, speed, timestamp) {
  userLocation = {
    userId: userId,
    latitude: latitude,
    longitude: longitude,
    speed: speed,
    timestamp: timestamp
  }

  zones = getContentZonesWithinRadius(userLocation)

  for zone in zones {
    if (checkBehavioralRadii(userLocation, zone)) {
      content = zone.content
      deliverContentToUser(userId, content)
    }
  }
}

function checkBehavioralRadii(userLocation, zone) {
  for radius in zone.behavioralRadii {
    if (radius.type == "Lingering") {
      if (user has been within zone for > radius.duration) {
        return true
      }
    } else if (radius.type == "Approach") {
      if (user speed > radius.minSpeed AND user is approaching zone) {
        return true
      }
    }
    // Add other radius types as needed
  }
  return false
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Retail:** Deliver personalized promotions as customers walk through stores.
*   **Tourism:** Provide location-based information and AR experiences at historical sites.
*   **Events:** Offer real-time updates and interactive content at concerts and festivals.
*   **Smart Cities:** Provide citizens with information about local services and events.
*   **Museums/Galleries:** Contextual content delivery to provide users with information on each exhibit.
