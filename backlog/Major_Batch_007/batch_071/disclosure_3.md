## Dynamic Certificate Attestation via Blockchain

**Concept:** Leverage a permissioned blockchain to create a dynamic, tamper-proof attestation service for client certificates, extending beyond simple validation to include reputation scoring and revocation propagation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Blockchain Layer:**

*   **Type:** Permissioned Blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, etc.) - control over node participation is essential.
*   **Nodes:** Operated by trusted entities – Certificate Authorities (CAs), major ISPs, security vendors.
*   **Data Structure:**  “Certificate Attestation Records” – Each record contains:
    *   `Certificate Hash`: SHA256 hash of the client’s certificate.
    *   `Attestation Timestamp`:  Time the attestation was created.
    *   `Attesting Entity ID`: Identifier of the entity creating the attestation.
    *   `Reputation Score`: Integer value representing the certificate’s reputation (initialized to a neutral value).
    *   `Flags`: Boolean flags for:
        *   `IsRevoked`: Indicates certificate revocation.
        *   `IsSuspect`: Flags certificates flagged as potentially malicious.
        *   `IsVerified`:  Confirms certificate validity via traditional methods.
    *   `Evidence`:  (Optional)  Links to supporting data for reputation adjustments (e.g., malware reports, behavioral analysis).

**2. Client Integration:**

*   **Pre-Handshake Attestation Request:** Before TLS handshake, the client sends a request to a designated "Attestation Service" (hosted by a blockchain node) providing its certificate chain.
*   **Attestation Service Lookup:** The Attestation Service queries the blockchain for a matching `Certificate Hash`.
*   **Reputation Scoring Logic:**
    *   If the certificate is found: Return the `Reputation Score`, `IsRevoked`, and `IsSuspect` flags.
    *   If the certificate is *not* found: Initiate a process to verify the certificate with traditional methods (OCSP/CRL) and submit a new `Certificate Attestation Record` to the blockchain with an initial neutral `Reputation Score`.
*   **Reputation Adjustment:**  Entities can submit "Reputation Adjustment Transactions" to the blockchain to increase or decrease a certificate's score based on observed behavior or threat intelligence.  Transactions require consensus among blockchain nodes.

**3. Server Integration:**

*   **TLS Handshake Modification:** During the TLS handshake, the server queries the Attestation Service (using the blockchain) with the client's certificate hash.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** Based on the `Reputation Score`, `IsRevoked`, and `IsSuspect` flags, the server can:
    *   Allow the connection.
    *   Request additional authentication factors (MFA).
    *   Throttle or block the connection.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function handleTLSHandshake(clientCertificate) {
  certificateHash = SHA256(clientCertificate);
  attestationData = queryBlockchain(certificateHash);

  if (attestationData.isRevoked) {
    rejectConnection("Certificate is revoked");
    return;
  }

  if (attestationData.isSuspect) {
    requireMFA(client); // Request additional authentication
  }

  if (attestationData.reputationScore < threshold) {
    throttleConnection(client); // Limit bandwidth/requests
  }

  // Proceed with normal TLS handshake
}
```

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond simple certificate validation to provide a dynamic reputation system, enabling servers to make more informed access control decisions.  The blockchain ensures tamper-proof attestation and allows for collaborative threat intelligence sharing.  It introduces a layer of behavioral analysis *before* a connection is fully established, and adds significant nuance to the TLS process.
