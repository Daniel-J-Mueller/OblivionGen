## Adaptive Lease Duration & Predictive Handover

**Concept:** Introduce a system where the lease duration for the master node isn't fixed, but dynamically adjusted based on network conditions *and* predictive analysis of node health.  Furthermore, implement a "warm handover" mechanism where a potential new master begins preparing *before* the current lease expires, minimizing disruption.

**Specifications:**

**1. Node Health Monitoring Module:**

*   **Data Collected:** CPU load, memory usage, disk I/O, network latency (to other nodes), historical failure rates, and potentially even predictive maintenance data (if available).
*   **Metrics:**  Each metric assigned a weighted score.  Combined score determines a "Node Health Index" (NHI).
*   **Thresholds:**  Define NHI thresholds: ‘Excellent’, ‘Good’, ‘Warning’, ‘Critical’.

**2. Adaptive Lease Duration Algorithm:**

*   **Base Lease Duration:**  A configurable base duration (e.g., 30 seconds).
*   **Adjustment Factors:**
    *   **NHI Factor:**  Higher NHI = shorter lease duration.  (e.g., Excellent: -10%, Good: -5%, Warning: +10%, Critical: +30%).
    *   **Network Stability Factor:** Monitor network latency fluctuations. Higher fluctuations = shorter lease duration. Calculated as standard deviation of round-trip times over a sliding window.
    *   **Load Factor:** Monitor the overall load on the master node. Higher load = shorter lease duration.
*   **Calculation:** `Adjusted Lease Duration = Base Lease Duration * (1 + NHI Factor + Network Stability Factor + Load Factor)`
*   **Minimum/Maximum Limits:**  Enforce minimum and maximum lease durations to prevent instability or excessive overhead.

**3. Predictive Handover Mechanism:**

*   **Candidate Master Selection:**  Identify potential candidate masters based on:
    *   High NHI
    *   Low current load
    *   Network proximity to other nodes
*   **Pre-Synchronization:** Before the lease expires, the current master begins asynchronously replicating *state* (not just data) to the chosen candidate. This includes:
    *   In-flight transactions
    *   Metadata about ongoing operations
    *   Lease information
*   **Lease Transfer:** A special “Lease Transfer” message is broadcast to all nodes. This message includes:
    *   New Master ID
    *   Confirmation that pre-synchronization is complete
*   **Switchover:** Nodes switch to using the new master. The old master transitions to a passive state.
*   **Rollback:** If the candidate fails during pre-synchronization or switchover, the system reverts to the standard election process.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Master Node

function calculateAdjustedLeaseDuration() {
  nhI = getNodeHealthIndex();
  networkStability = getNetworkStability();
  load = getNodeLoad();

  adjustedLease = baseLease * (1 + nhI + networkStability + load);
  adjustedLease = constrain(adjustedLease, minLease, maxLease);
  return adjustedLease;
}

function heartbeat() {
  adjustedLease = calculateAdjustedLeaseDuration();
  sendHeartbeat(adjustedLease);
}

function initiatePreSynchronization(candidateNode) {
  replicateStateTo(candidateNode);
  sendLeaseTransferMessage(candidateNode);
}

// Node (General)

function receiveHeartbeat(adjustedLease) {
  currentLeaseDuration = adjustedLease;
}

function receiveLeaseTransferMessage(newMasterNode) {
  switchToNewMaster(newMasterNode);
}
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Byzantine Fault Tolerance:**  Consider incorporating mechanisms to mitigate malicious behavior.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:**  Track lease durations, handover frequency, and system performance.
*   **Configuration:** Provide extensive configuration options to tune the system for different workloads.
