## Dynamic Tag Weighting based on Sensory Fusion

**Concept:** Expand beyond location and time-based tags by incorporating real-time sensory data (audio, atmospheric pressure, temperature, accelerometer) to create a dynamic weighting system for tag suggestions. This moves beyond descriptive tags to *contextual* tags.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensory Input Module:**
    *   Microphone: Continuous audio capture.
    *   Barometer: Atmospheric pressure readings.
    *   Thermometer: Temperature readings.
    *   Accelerometer: Motion/orientation data.
*   **Data Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  **Feature Extraction:**  Analyze audio for dominant sounds (speech, music, nature sounds, machinery). Barometer and thermometer data provide atmospheric conditions. Accelerometer data detects movement (walking, running, stationary).
    2.  **Contextual Mapping:** Map extracted features to predefined contextual categories. Examples:
        *   Audio: “Conversation,” “Music – Classical,” “Nature – Birds,” “Industrial – Machine Noise”
        *   Atmospheric: “Clear – High Pressure,” “Cloudy – Low Pressure,” “Rainy – Moderate Pressure”
        *   Motion: “Static,” “Walking – Slow,” “Running – Fast”
    3.  **Tag Association Database:** Maintain a database linking contextual categories to relevant tags.  This database is initially populated with basic associations (e.g., "Nature - Birds" -> "Outdoors," "Wildlife," "Park") but *learns* through user interaction (see “User Feedback Loop” below).
*   **Dynamic Tag Weighting Algorithm:**
    1.  When an image/digital content is captured:
        *   Gather sensory data *concurrently* with the content capture.
        *   Run data through the Feature Extraction and Contextual Mapping pipeline.
        *   Retrieve associated tags from the Tag Association Database.
        *   Assign a ‘contextual weight’ to each tag based on the strength of the sensory match.  (Example: High confidence "Music - Classical" gets a weight of 0.8, moderate confidence "Rainy" gets 0.4).
        *   Combine the contextual weight with existing weights (location, time, user preferences – see below).
    2.  **Weight Combination:** Use a weighted sum formula:  `FinalTagWeight = (LocationWeight * LocationFactor) + (TimeWeight * TimeFactor) + (ContextWeight * ContextFactor) + (UserPreferenceWeight * UserPreferenceFactor)`. The factors allow tuning the relative importance of each weighting system.
*   **User Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitor tag selections and rejections.
    *   Adjust weights in the Tag Association Database and the weighting factors dynamically based on user behavior. (If a user consistently rejects tags related to "Classical Music" when the audio *clearly* indicates classical music, lower the weight of that association).
*   **User Preference Storage:** Store a user profile with preferred tags and negative tags. Use this data to bias tag suggestions.
*   **API Integration:** Provide APIs for developers to create custom contextual categories, associations, and weighting algorithms.



**Pseudocode (Tag Suggestion Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateTagSuggestions(digitalContent, location, timestamp, sensoryData):

    tags = []
    locationTags = GetTagsForLocation(location)
    timeTags = GetTagsForTime(timestamp)
    sensoryTags = GetTagsForSensoryData(sensoryData)
    userTags = GetUserPreferredTags()

    // Calculate weights
    locationWeight = 0.5
    timeWeight = 0.2
    sensoryWeight = 0.2
    userWeight = 0.1

    // Combine tags and weights
    FOR tag IN locationTags:
        AddTagWithWeight(tag, locationWeight)
    FOR tag IN timeTags:
        AddTagWithWeight(tag, timeWeight)
    FOR tag IN sensoryTags:
        AddTagWithWeight(tag, sensoryWeight)
    FOR tag IN userTags:
        AddTagWithWeight(tag, userWeight)

    // Sort tags by weight (descending)
    sortedTags = SortTagsByWeight(tags)

    RETURN sortedTags
