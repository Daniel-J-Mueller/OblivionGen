**Personalized Factor Weighting & Predictive Purchase Assistance**

**Concept:** Expand the existing research note functionality to dynamically learn and predict a user’s weighting of comparison factors *across all* users, then proactively suggest relevant factors *before* a user even begins a comparison. This moves beyond simple note-taking to a proactive, predictive assistance system.

**Specs:**

1.  **Factor Ontology:** Establish a structured ontology of comparison factors. This is a hierarchical taxonomy of attributes used for comparing items (e.g., “Display Quality” -> “Resolution” -> “4K”, “Refresh Rate”, “Panel Type”). This ontology should be extensible.

2.  **User Interaction Data Collection:**
    *   Monitor user interactions *beyond* explicit factor weighting. Track:
        *   Time spent viewing each factor within a research note.
        *   Order in which factors are viewed.
        *   Scrolling behavior within factor sections.
        *   Frequency with which a user edits a specific factor’s value.
        *   Clicks on ‘helpful’/’not helpful’ for specific factors within other users’ research notes.
    *   Record implicit factor prioritization through browsing behavior *prior* to initiating a research note. If a user consistently filters products by “battery life,” that signals a high priority.

3.  **Weighting Algorithm:** Employ a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Bayesian Network, Neural Network) to calculate dynamic factor weights *per user*. Inputs:
    *   Explicit factor weighting (if provided).
    *   Implicit data from user interaction data collection (see above).
    *   Aggregated data from all users – identifying statistically significant factor preferences for specific product categories.

4.  **Proactive Factor Suggestion:**
    *   When a user views a product in a category where they have initiated research notes before, or when they view multiple similar items, the system displays a “Suggested Factors” list.
    *   The list is dynamically generated based on the user’s calculated factor weights (from step 3).  Most heavily weighted factors appear first.
    *   A ‘Learn From This Comparison’ toggle allows the user to opt-in to further refine their factor weights based on this specific comparison.

5.  **Predictive Purchase Scores:**
    *   Based on the user’s weighted factors, the system calculates a “Purchase Score” for each item being compared.
    *   This score is displayed prominently alongside the item, providing a quick indication of its suitability for the user’s needs.
    *   The system should allow users to “drill down” into the score, seeing which factors contributed the most to the result.

6.  **“Factor Blind Spot” Detection:** If a user consistently ignores or downplays a factor that is statistically important for other users in the same product category, the system proactively alerts them: “Users who purchase items like this often prioritize [Factor]. Would you like to add it to your comparison?”

7.  **API Integration:** Provide an API allowing third-party developers to integrate the weighted factor system into their own applications (e.g., personalized product recommendation engines).



**Pseudocode (Simplified Weighting Algorithm):**

```
// Input: User ID, Product Category, Factor List
// Output: Factor Weight List (normalized 0-1)

function calculateFactorWeights(userID, category, factorList) {
    explicitWeights = getExplicitWeights(userID, factorList); // From user settings
    implicitWeightSum = 0;
    for each factor in factorList {
        // Calculate implicit weight based on viewing time, edits, etc.
        implicitWeight = calculateImplicitWeight(userID, factor);
        implicitWeightSum += implicitWeight;
    }

    // Aggregate explicit and implicit weights
    for each factor in factorList {
        combinedWeight = (explicitWeights[factor] * 0.4) + (implicitWeight[factor] / implicitWeightSum * 0.6); // weighted average

    }
    normalizeWeights(combinedWeights);

    return combinedWeights;
}
```
