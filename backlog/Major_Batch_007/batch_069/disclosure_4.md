## Dynamic Host Reputation & Predictive Rerouting

**Concept:** Expand on the rerouting aspect of the patent by incorporating a dynamic host reputation system that *predicts* potential threats *before* they fully manifest, and proactively adjusts rerouting policies based on this predictive analysis.  Instead of reacting to identified ‘specified conditions’, the system anticipates them.

**Specs:**

*   **Reputation Score:** Each host (client and potential attack source) is assigned a reputation score, initially neutral. This score dynamically adjusts based on several factors (see below).
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitor traffic patterns (volume, frequency, packet structure, destination ports, etc.). Deviations from baseline behavior contribute to reputation adjustments.
    *   **Geolocation Data:**  Associate IP addresses with geographic locations. Sudden shifts in geographic origin or connections from known malicious regions impact reputation.
    *   **Threat Intelligence Feeds:** Integrate external threat intelligence feeds (blacklists, malware databases, vulnerability reports).
    *   **Behavioral Analysis:** Track host ‘behavior’ – sequences of requests, response times, error rates. Anomalous behavior lowers reputation.
    *   **Peer Reputation:** Incorporate reputation scores from peers (other monitored hosts).
*   **Reputation Algorithm:**  A weighted scoring system. Weights are adjustable.  Algorithm should incorporate decay – older data has less influence. Example:

    `Reputation = (TrafficScore * WeightTraffic) + (GeoScore * WeightGeo) + (ThreatIntelScore * WeightThreat) + (BehaviorScore * WeightBehavior) + (PeerRepScore * WeightPeer) – (TimeDecay * AgeOfData)`

*   **Predictive Rerouting Engine:** This engine monitors reputation scores in real-time. It utilizes a threshold-based system with adjustable sensitivity.

    *   **Pre-emptive Rerouting:** When a host’s reputation *falls below* a pre-defined threshold, the Predictive Rerouting Engine *proactively* reroutes traffic destined for that host *before* any malicious activity is definitively confirmed.
    *   **Rerouting Levels:** Multiple rerouting levels based on reputation score.
        *   **Level 1 (Low Reputation):** Traffic is rate-limited and subjected to deep packet inspection.
        *   **Level 2 (Medium Reputation):** Traffic is routed through a ‘sandbox’ – a controlled environment for analyzing behavior.
        *   **Level 3 (High Reputation):** Traffic is blocked entirely.
*   **AI/ML Integration:** A machine learning model trained on historical data to refine the reputation algorithm and the predictive rerouting thresholds.  The model learns to identify subtle patterns indicative of potential threats.
*   **Feedback Loop:** The system analyzes the outcome of rerouted traffic. If the rerouted traffic is indeed malicious, the model adjusts weights and thresholds accordingly. If the traffic is benign, the system adjusts the host’s reputation upward and relaxes rerouting policies.
*   **API Integration:** Provide APIs for:
    *   Retrieving host reputation scores.
    *   Adjusting rerouting policies.
    *   Providing custom threat intelligence data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculate_reputation(host_ip):
  traffic_score = analyze_traffic(host_ip)
  geo_score = analyze_geolocation(host_ip)
  threat_intel_score = check_threat_feeds(host_ip)
  behavior_score = analyze_behavior(host_ip)
  peer_rep_score = get_peer_reputation(host_ip)

  reputation = (traffic_score * WEIGHT_TRAFFIC) + (geo_score * WEIGHT_GEO) + (threat_intel_score * WEIGHT_THREAT) + (behavior_score * WEIGHT_BEHAVIOR) + (peer_rep_score * WEIGHT_PEER) - (TIME_DECAY * age_of_data)

  return reputation

function reroute_traffic(traffic, destination_ip):
  reputation = calculate_reputation(destination_ip)

  if reputation < LEVEL_1_THRESHOLD:
    # Apply rate limiting and deep packet inspection
    processed_traffic = process_traffic_level_1(traffic)
  elif reputation < LEVEL_2_THRESHOLD:
    # Route to sandbox for analysis
    processed_traffic = sandbox_analysis(traffic)
  elif reputation < LEVEL_3_THRESHOLD:
    # Block traffic
    processed_traffic = null
  else:
    # Forward traffic normally
    processed_traffic = forward_traffic(traffic)

  return processed_traffic
```

This system shifts the focus from *reacting* to threats to *anticipating* them, creating a more proactive and robust security posture. It requires significant computational resources, but the potential benefits in terms of reduced risk and improved security are substantial.
