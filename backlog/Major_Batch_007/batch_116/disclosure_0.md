## Dynamic Region-of-Interest Encoding & Prioritization

**Concept:** Extend the region-based encoding to include dynamic prioritization based on perceived user attention, motion activity, or semantic importance within each video stream *before* combining them. This allows for intelligent bandwidth allocation and quality scaling *within* the combined stream, optimizing perceived quality where it matters most.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multiple independently encoded video streams (as per the base patent).  Additionally, a real-time attention map (or equivalent data source indicating saliency) for each stream. This could derive from eye-tracking (if available), motion detection, object recognition (identifying ‘important’ objects), or a combination.
*   **Pre-Processing (per stream):**
    *   **Attention Map Generation:** If not provided, generate an attention map for each stream based on motion vectors, scene changes, and object recognition.
    *   **Region Segmentation:** Divide each frame into regions (tiles/slices - leveraging existing codec features).
    *   **Region Prioritization:**  Assign a priority score to each region based on its corresponding value in the attention map. Higher attention = higher priority.
*   **Combined Stream Metadata Generation:**
    *   **Priority Metadata:** Augment the combined stream metadata with a priority map for *each* input stream. This map indicates the relative importance of each region in that stream.
    *   **Quality Level Mapping:** Define a set of quality levels (e.g., bitrate, resolution) for each region. The quality level assigned to a region is determined by its priority *and* available bandwidth.
*   **Combined Stream Generation:**
    *   **Dynamic Bitrate Allocation:**  Allocate bandwidth dynamically to each region of each stream based on its priority.  High-priority regions receive more bandwidth, resulting in higher quality. Lower-priority regions receive less bandwidth.
    *   **Region-Specific Encoding Parameters:**  Adjust encoding parameters (e.g., quantization parameter, GOP size) for each region to optimize quality within bandwidth constraints.
    *   **Scalability Layers:** Include scalability layers within the combined stream to allow for adaptation to different network conditions.  Lower layers contain the basic video content, while higher layers add detail and quality to high-priority regions.
*   **Decoding & Presentation:**
    *   **Priority-Aware Decoding:** The decoder uses the priority metadata to allocate resources effectively during decoding.
    *   **Adaptive Display:**  Dynamically adjust the display of high-priority regions to enhance their visual impact (e.g., sharpening, color enhancement).

**Pseudocode (Combined Stream Generation):**

```
function generateCombinedStream(inputStreams, attentionMaps, availableBandwidth) {
  combinedMetadata = createCombinedMetadata()
  combinedStream = createVideoStream()

  for each stream in inputStreams {
    streamMetadata = stream.getMetadata()
    attentionMap = attentionMaps[stream.id]

    for each region in stream.frame {
      priority = calculatePriority(region, attentionMap)
      qualityLevel = allocateQuality(priority, availableBandwidth)
      encodeRegion(region, qualityLevel)
      addRegionToStream(encodedRegion)
      updateCombinedMetadata(region, stream.id, priority)
    }
  }

  return combinedStream with combinedMetadata
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved perceived quality, especially in multi-participant video conferencing.
*   More efficient bandwidth utilization.
*   Enhanced user experience.
*   Ability to prioritize critical visual information.
