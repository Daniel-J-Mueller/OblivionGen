## Adaptive Data Masking with Behavioral Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the fine-grained access control to *dynamically* mask data based on the observed behavior of the application client, rather than relying solely on static delegation policies. This aims to proactively protect sensitive data even if an application client's behavior deviates from its expected norm, potentially indicating a compromise or malicious activity.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Behavioral Analysis Module (BAM) integrated into the Delegation Service.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Application Client Access Logs: Timestamped records of all data requests, including requested data elements, data types, and access patterns.
    *   Application Client Metadata: Registered application details including its intended function and expected data access profile.
    *   Data Sensitivity Tags: Metadata assigned to each data element indicating its sensitivity level (e.g., PII, confidential, public).
*   **BAM Functionality:**
    1.  **Baseline Creation:** Upon initial registration, the BAM observes the application client's data access patterns and creates a behavioral baseline. This baseline represents the 'normal' data access behavior of the application. Utilize statistical methods (e.g., frequency analysis, time series analysis) to define this baseline.
    2.  **Real-time Anomaly Detection:** Continuously monitor the application client's data access requests in real-time. Compare current access patterns against the established baseline. Implement anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., clustering, outlier detection) to identify deviations from the baseline.
    3.  **Dynamic Masking Rules:** Based on detected anomalies, dynamically generate masking rules. These rules determine which data elements to mask or redact in real-time before serving the data to the application client.
    4.  **Adaptive Thresholds:** Adjust anomaly detection thresholds dynamically based on the observed data and system behavior. This prevents false positives and ensures accurate detection of genuine anomalies.
*   **Integration with Fine-Grained Access Management Module:**
    1.  The Fine-Grained Access Management Module consults the BAM before providing data access.
    2.  The BAM provides masking rules based on real-time anomaly detection.
    3.  The Fine-Grained Access Management Module applies the masking rules to the data before serving it to the application client.
*   **Pseudocode (BAM Core Logic):**

```
function analyze_access(application_client_id, requested_data, timestamp):
  baseline = get_baseline(application_client_id)
  anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(requested_data, baseline)

  if anomaly_score > threshold:
    masking_rules = generate_masking_rules(anomaly_score)
    return masking_rules
  else:
    return []

function calculate_anomaly_score(requested_data, baseline):
  // Implement anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., based on deviations in data types, access frequency, time intervals)
  // Return a numerical score representing the degree of deviation from the baseline

function generate_masking_rules(anomaly_score):
  // Based on the anomaly score, determine which data elements to mask or redact
  // Higher anomaly scores trigger more aggressive masking rules
  // Consider masking sensitive data elements first (e.g., PII)
  // Return a list of masking rules (e.g., "mask column 'credit_card_number'", "redact field 'social_security_number'")
```

*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   Protect the BAM from tampering and unauthorized access.
    *   Ensure the accuracy and reliability of the baseline data.
    *   Regularly review and update the anomaly detection algorithms and masking rules.
    *   Implement logging and auditing mechanisms to track BAM activity.
