**Adaptive Action Prioritization via Predicted Cognitive Load**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:**

Extend the existing system to incorporate a predictive model of user cognitive load. Instead of simply preventing actions based on historical failures or timeouts, the system *estimates* the user’s current mental workload and *prioritizes* or *delays* actions accordingly. This prevents nuisance blocking while still protecting against overload.

**II. Components:**

*   **Cognitive Load Sensor Suite:**
    *   **Physiological Data:** Integrate data from wearable sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance, EEG – optional) to establish a baseline cognitive load profile for the user.
    *   **Environmental Context:** Analyze environmental data (noise levels, visual clutter, concurrent tasks detected via device usage, calendar entries) to assess external cognitive demands.
    *   **Application Usage:** Monitor current application usage to determine the complexity of tasks being performed.
    *   **Speech/Text Analysis:** If voice/text input is present, analyze phrasing complexity, rate of speech/typing, and sentiment to infer cognitive effort.
*   **Cognitive Load Prediction Model:**
    *   Employ a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, long short-term memory network) trained on the collected data to predict the user’s current and near-future cognitive load. The model should output a cognitive load score (e.g., 0-100).
*   **Action Prioritization Engine:**
    *   Assign a “cognitive cost” to each potential action. This cost represents the estimated mental effort required to complete the action (e.g., a simple notification has low cost, a complex data analysis has high cost).
    *   Compare the predicted cognitive load score with the cognitive cost of each action.
    *   Prioritize actions based on this comparison. Actions with low cognitive cost are executed immediately. Actions with high cognitive cost are delayed or presented as lower-priority notifications.
    *   Implement a dynamic adjustment mechanism. If the user consistently overrides delayed actions, the system lowers the threshold for executing high-cost actions.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
// Data Structures
struct UserCognitiveState {
  float cognitiveLoadScore;
  // Other relevant data (e.g., attention level, fatigue)
};

struct Action {
  string actionName;
  int cognitiveCost;
  // Other action properties (e.g., urgency, importance)
};

// Function: Predict User Cognitive Load
function predictCognitiveLoad(sensorData, environmentalData, appUsage) -> UserCognitiveState {
  // Load trained ML model
  // Process input data
  // Return predicted cognitive load score
}

// Function: Prioritize Actions
function prioritizeActions(userState, actionList) -> List<Action> {
  sortedActionList = new List<Action>();

  for each action in actionList {
    priorityScore = userState.cognitiveLoadScore + action.cognitiveCost;
    sortedActionList.add(action with priorityScore);
  }

  sortedActionList.sort(by priorityScore);

  return sortedActionList;
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  sensorData = getSensorData();
  environmentalData = getEnvironmentalData();
  appUsage = getAppUsage();

  userState = predictCognitiveLoad(sensorData, environmentalData, appUsage);

  actionList = getPendingActions();

  prioritizedActionList = prioritizeActions(userState, actionList);

  for each action in prioritizedActionList {
    if (userState.cognitiveLoadScore + action.cognitiveCost < threshold) {
      executeAction(action);
    } else {
      deferAction(action); // or present as low-priority notification
    }
  }
}
```

**IV. Extensions:**

*   **Personalized Thresholds:**  Dynamically adjust the cognitive load threshold based on individual user preferences and performance.
*   **Context-Aware Adaptation:** Tailor the prioritization strategy to specific contexts (e.g., driving, working, relaxing).
*   **Proactive Mitigation:**  Based on predicted cognitive overload, proactively suggest simplifying tasks or postponing non-critical actions.
*   **Explainable AI:** Provide the user with insights into why certain actions were prioritized or delayed, increasing trust and transparency.
