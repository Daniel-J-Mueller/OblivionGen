## Adaptive Task Delegation with Predictive Skill Matching

**Concept:** Extend the adaptive interface concept to *proactively* delegate tasks to human performers based on predicted skill availability *before* a request is even fully formulated. This moves beyond simply adapting requests *to* a performer; it anticipates needs and preemptively assigns resources.

**Specs:**

*   **Skill Graph Database:** A persistent database storing granular skill profiles of all potential human task performers. Skills are represented as nodes, with relationships defining skill hierarchies, dependencies (e.g., "requires skill X"), and proficiency levels (validated via performance data). Each skill has associated metadata: cost/hour, availability, preferred task types, learning rate.
*   **Task Decomposition Engine:** Upon receiving a high-level task request (potentially incomplete), this engine decomposes it into a series of sub-tasks. This leverages a knowledge base of common task decompositions and utilizes NLP to interpret vague requests.
*   **Predictive Skill Matching Algorithm:**  This is the core component. It operates as follows:
    1.  For each sub-task, identify required skills (from the Skill Graph).
    2.  Query the Skill Graph for potential performers, prioritizing:
        *   **Skill Match:** Highest proficiency in required skills.
        *   **Availability:** Real-time and predicted availability (considering scheduled tasks, breaks, historical workload).
        *   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Balancing skill level and hourly rate.
        *   **Learning Potential:**  If a performer lacks a *specific* skill, assess their ability to quickly learn it based on related skill proficiency and historical learning rate.  Introduce a ‘learning cost’ factor.
    3.  Construct a ‘task assignment plan’ detailing the sequence of sub-tasks and assigned performers.
    4.  Dynamically adjust the plan based on:
        *   Performer acceptance/rejection of tasks.
        *   Changes in performer availability.
        *   Unexpected task complexities revealed during execution.
*   **Proactive Task Presentation:**  Instead of waiting for a complete request, the system presents potential tasks to performers *before* the request is fully formed.  This is done through a dedicated interface showing task descriptions, estimated time commitment, and potential rewards.  Performers can ‘pre-commit’ to tasks, increasing the likelihood of successful assignment.
*   **Automated Learning Path Generation:** If a performer lacks a critical skill, the system automatically generates a personalized learning path consisting of relevant training materials and practice exercises. The path is integrated into the task workflow, allowing the performer to acquire the necessary skills *while* performing the task.
*   **Dynamic Pricing & Reward System:** Based on the difficulty of the task, the performer’s skill level, and the urgency of the request, the system dynamically adjusts the reward offered for task completion.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Skill Matching Algorithm):**

```
function match_task_to_performers(task, skill_graph, performers):
  sub_tasks = decompose_task(task)
  potential_performers = []

  for sub_task in sub_tasks:
    required_skills = identify_skills(sub_task)

    eligible_performers = []
    for performer in performers:
      skill_match_score = calculate_skill_match(performer, required_skills)
      availability_score = check_availability(performer)
      cost_score = calculate_cost(performer)
      learning_score = calculate_learning_potential(performer, required_skills)

      total_score = skill_match_score * 0.5 + availability_score * 0.2 + cost_score * 0.1 + learning_score * 0.2

      if total_score > threshold:
        eligible_performers.append(performer)

    potential_performers.append(eligible_performers)

  # Select the best performer for each sub-task based on scoring.
  # Handle cases where no performer is suitable.
  return potential_performers
