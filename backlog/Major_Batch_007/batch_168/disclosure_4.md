## Dynamic Offer Bundling & Predictive Pricing

**Concept:** Expand the rule generation to not only *react* to feedback, but *proactively* suggest offer bundles and dynamic pricing adjustments *before* user feedback is received, based on predicted buyer needs and competitive landscape. This moves beyond simple rule application to intelligent offer *creation*.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Feature Engineering:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   User browsing history (items viewed, search queries)
    *   Purchase history (individual and aggregated)
    *   Real-time competitor pricing data (scraped or API access)
    *   Item attribute data (detailed specifications, categories)
    *   Social media trends (relevant keywords, sentiment analysis)
    *   Geographic location data (to infer local demand)
*   **Feature Engineering:**
    *   **Buyer Profile:** Create a profile for each user based on historical data (preferences, price sensitivity, preferred brands).
    *   **Item Similarity:** Calculate similarity scores between items based on attributes and co-purchase data.
    *   **Demand Forecasting:** Use time series analysis to predict future demand for each item.
    *   **Competitive Landscape Analysis:** Identify key competitors for each item and track their pricing strategies.

**2. Bundle Recommendation Engine:**

*   **Algorithm:** Implement a collaborative filtering algorithm (e.g., matrix factorization) combined with rule-based constraints.
*   **Bundle Generation:** Automatically generate potential bundles based on:
    *   Items frequently purchased together.
    *   Items with complementary attributes.
    *   Items that address predicted buyer needs.
*   **Pricing Optimization:**
    *   Calculate optimal bundle price based on individual item prices, demand elasticity, and competitor pricing.
    *   Dynamically adjust bundle price based on real-time data and predicted buyer behavior.

**3. Predictive Rule Generation:**

*   **Machine Learning Model:** Train a predictive model (e.g., neural network) to generate rules based on historical data and predicted buyer behavior.
*   **Rule Generation Process:**
    1.  Analyze historical feedback data to identify patterns and correlations.
    2.  Use the trained model to predict potential buyer concerns and preferences.
    3.  Generate rules that address those concerns and preferences.
    4.  Present the generated rules to rule authors for validation and refinement.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Microservices Architecture:** Design a modular system with separate microservices for data ingestion, feature engineering, bundle recommendation, predictive rule generation, and rule validation.
*   **API Integration:** Provide APIs for accessing the bundle recommendation and predictive rule generation services.
*   **Real-time Data Processing:** Utilize a stream processing platform (e.g., Kafka) for real-time data ingestion and processing.
*   **Database:** Utilize a scalable database (e.g., Cassandra) for storing user data, item data, and rule data.

**Pseudocode (Bundle Recommendation Engine):**

```
function recommend_bundles(user_id, item_id):
  // 1. Get user profile
  user_profile = get_user_profile(user_id)

  // 2. Get similar items
  similar_items = get_similar_items(item_id, user_profile)

  // 3. Filter out items already in cart
  items_in_cart = get_items_in_cart(user_id)
  filtered_items = [item for item in similar_items if item not in items_in_cart]

  // 4. Generate potential bundles
  potential_bundles = generate_bundles(filtered_items)

  // 5. Calculate bundle price
  for bundle in potential_bundles:
    bundle.price = calculate_bundle_price(bundle)

  // 6. Sort bundles by price and relevance
  sorted_bundles = sort_bundles(sorted_bundles, user_profile)

  // 7. Return top N bundles
  return sorted_bundles[:N]
```

**Innovation:** This shifts the system from reactive adjustments to proactive offer design, potentially increasing sales and customer satisfaction. It integrates predictive analytics with rule-based systems, creating a more intelligent and personalized shopping experience. It also opens possibilities for A/B testing different bundle configurations and pricing strategies.
