## Personalized Skill "Shadowing" & Proactive Rephrasing

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of rewriting user inputs to *proactively* anticipate likely misinterpretations *before* the NLU component processes them, based on a continuously learning "shadow skill" mirroring user behavior.

**Specs:**

1.  **Shadow Skill Creation:** For each user profile, instantiate a "shadow skill" – a separate, lightweight NLU model initially mirroring the primary NLU. This shadow skill receives *all* user input *before* the primary NLU.

2.  **Behavioral Logging:** The shadow skill logs all input, predicted intent, *and* any subsequent user corrections (rephrasing, interruptions, explicit negative feedback – as already described in the base patent).  Crucially, it also logs the *time* elapsed between input and correction. Shorter times indicate higher confidence in the correction as being a direct response to the initial misinterpretation.

3.  **Misinterpretation Pattern Identification:**  The shadow skill utilizes a sliding window analysis to identify frequent misinterpretation patterns.  For example:
    *   Input: "Play some jazz" -> System: Plays classical -> User: "No, *jazz*!" (short delay) -> Pattern:  Ambiguity between "classical" and "jazz" for this user.
    *   Input: "Set a timer for 10 minutes" -> System: Adds event to calendar -> User: "I said a *timer*!" (short delay) -> Pattern: Confusion between "timer" and "calendar event".

4.  **Proactive Rephrasing Module:** A dedicated module analyzes incoming user input. *Before* the primary NLU processes it, the module compares the input to the identified misinterpretation patterns.

    *   If a likely misinterpretation is detected, the module generates a set of rephrased inputs that *resolve* the ambiguity, based on past corrections.
    *   The module *doesn’t* immediately use the rephrased input. Instead, it passes *both* the original input *and* the rephrased inputs to the primary NLU.

5.  **NLU Confidence Scoring & Selection:** The primary NLU processes both inputs and generates confidence scores for each. A weighting function favors the rephrased input *if*:
    *   The rephrased input aligns with a strong misinterpretation pattern.
    *   The confidence score difference between rephrased and original input is above a threshold.
    *   The pattern alignment represents a short delay observed between input and correction.

6.  **Continuous Learning:** The shadow skill continues to learn and refine its patterns based on all user interactions. The weighting function dynamically adjusts based on the shadow skill’s confidence in its predictions.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Rephrasing Module):**

```
function proactivelyRephrase(userInput, userProfile):
  misinterpretationPatterns = userProfile.shadowSkill.getMisinterpretationPatterns(userInput)
  if misinterpretationPatterns.isEmpty():
    return userInput  // No likely misinterpretations

  rephrasedInputs = []
  for pattern in misinterpretationPatterns:
    rephrasedInput = pattern.generateRephrasedInput(userInput)
    rephrasedInputs.append(rephrasedInput)

  return [userInput, *rephrasedInputs]
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significantly reduced need for explicit negative feedback.
*   More natural and fluid user experience.
*   Highly personalized and adaptive NLU.
*   Improved accuracy for ambiguous or complex inputs.
