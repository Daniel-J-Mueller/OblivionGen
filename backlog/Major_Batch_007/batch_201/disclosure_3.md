## Dynamic Resource Mirroring Based on Real-Time CDN Interconnect Health

**Concept:** Extend the existing “sloppy routing” concept beyond simply selecting alternate POPs based on latency or bandwidth. Implement a system that dynamically mirrors content *between* CDN POPs based on real-time interconnect health and predictive failure analysis. This moves beyond reactive routing to *proactive* content pre-staging, ensuring minimal disruption even in the face of widespread network issues.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Interconnect Health Monitor (IHM) – Deployed at each CDN POP.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   BGP peering information (direct observation of network routes).
    *   ICMP probing of interconnects (latency, packet loss).
    *   Historical performance data (trend analysis).
    *   Real-time traffic volume on interconnects.
*   **Algorithm:** Predictive Failure Analysis (PFA)
    *   Utilize a weighted scoring system based on data from the IHM. Weights dynamically adjust based on historical data & current network state.
    *   PFA predicts the probability of interconnect degradation/failure within a defined time window (e.g., 5-30 minutes).
*   **Component:** Content Mirroring Manager (CMM) – Centralized control plane.
*   **Trigger:** When PFA predicts a high probability of interconnect degradation at POP A, the CMM initiates content mirroring to POP B.
*   **Mirroring Process:**
    *   Prioritize mirroring of “hot” content (most frequently requested) based on real-time CDN logs.
    *   Utilize a delta-sync approach – only mirror changed content to minimize bandwidth usage.
    *   Validate mirrored content integrity using checksums.
*   **DNS Integration:** Extend existing DNS-based routing to include a “mirroring flag”. When content is mirrored, DNS responses will direct clients to the POP with the mirrored content *before* an outage occurs.
*   **Failover:** If an interconnect *does* fail, the DNS-based routing seamlessly directs traffic to the POP with the mirrored content.
*   **Automatic Recalibration:**  The system continuously learns from past failures and adjusts the weighting factors in the PFA algorithm to improve prediction accuracy.

**Pseudocode (CMM):**

```
function monitor_interconnects():
    for each POP:
        health_data = IHM.get_health_data(POP)
        failure_probability = PFA.calculate_failure_probability(health_data)
        if failure_probability > threshold:
            identify_nearby_POP(POP) // Find a POP with sufficient capacity
            start_content_mirroring(POP, nearby_POP, hot_content_list)

function start_content_mirroring(source_POP, destination_POP, content_list):
    for each content_item in content_list:
        if content_item not in destination_POP:
            transfer_content(source_POP, destination_POP, content_item)
            verify_content_integrity(destination_POP, content_item)
            update_DNS_records(content_item, destination_POP)

function update_DNS_records(content_item, destination_POP):
    set DNS record for content_item to point to destination_POP with mirroring flag set
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Cost Optimization:**  Implement intelligent mirroring strategies that consider the cost of bandwidth and storage.
*   **Regional Compliance:**  Ensure mirroring respects regional data residency requirements.
*   **Cache Invalidation:**  Implement a mechanism to invalidate cached content on the original POP when it is no longer the primary source.
*   **Security:** Encrypt content during transfer and implement access controls to protect mirrored content.
