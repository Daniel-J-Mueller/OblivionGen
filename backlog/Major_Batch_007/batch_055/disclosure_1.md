## Adaptive Gifting Persona & Predictive Wishlist Integration

**Concept:** Expand the gifting system to not just enforce rules *on* a gift, but to dynamically *learn* the recipient's preferences and proactively suggest gifts, even before a gifting event is initiated. This is achieved via a recipient-side “gifting persona” built from observed behavior, purchase history (with consent, naturally), and potentially social media data (with explicit opt-in).

**Specs:**

**1. Recipient Persona Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Direct Purchase History.
    *   Browsing History (aggregated & anonymized – user controlled opt-in).
    *   Wishlists (explicitly linked).
    *   Social Media Signals (explicit opt-in – e.g., Pinterest boards, liked items on Facebook).
    *   Gift Receipt History (what gifts have been received and ‘liked’ or ‘returned’ – inferred preference).
*   **Preference Modeling:**
    *   Utilize a hybrid recommendation engine (collaborative filtering + content-based filtering).
    *   Categorize preferences using a multi-dimensional taxonomy (e.g., Style, Activity, Material, Brand, Price Range).
    *   Assign confidence scores to preferences based on data source and frequency.
    *   Dynamic persona update – preferences evolve over time.
*   **Persona Storage:** Securely stored profile, accessible via unique identifier.

**2. Predictive Wishlist Generation:**

*   **Algorithm:** Analyze the recipient persona to predict items the recipient *would* add to a wishlist, even if they haven’t yet.
*   **Wishlist Seed:** Based on persona data, create a "seed" wishlist of 5-10 potential items.
*   **Refinement Loop:**
    *   Present seed wishlist to recipient (optional, user-controlled).
    *   Recipient can add/remove items, providing feedback.
    *   Algorithm refines prediction based on feedback.
*   **Proactive Suggestions:** The system proactively suggests gift items to potential gift-givers based on the refined predictive wishlist.

**3. Gifting Rule Integration:**

*   **Constraint Layer:** Gift-giver defined rules (price range, category, etc.) are applied as a constraint layer *on top of* the predictive wishlist.
*   **Compatibility Score:** Each item in the predictive wishlist receives a “compatibility score” based on how well it matches both the recipient's preferences *and* the gift-giver’s rules.
*   **Filtered Presentation:** Gift suggestions are presented to the giver prioritized by compatibility score.

**4. System Architecture:**

```pseudocode
//Gifting System
class GiftingSystem {
    RecipientPersonaModule personaModule;
    PredictiveWishlistModule wishlistModule;
    GiftingRuleEngine ruleEngine;

    function suggestGifts(giverId, receiverId) {
        receiverPersona = personaModule.getPersona(receiverId);
        predictedWishlist = wishlistModule.getWishlist(receiverId);
        giverRules = ruleEngine.getRules(giverId);

        filteredGifts = filterGifts(predictedWishlist, giverRules);
        sortedGifts = sortGifts(filteredGifts, receiverPersona);

        return sortedGifts;
    }

    function filterGifts(wishlist, rules) {
        //Apply price range, category, etc.
        return filteredList;
    }

    function sortGifts(gifts, persona) {
        //Sort by compatibility score based on persona preferences
        return sortedList;
    }
}
```

**5. User Interface Considerations:**

*   Recipient UI: Transparent control over data sharing & persona building. Ability to review and refine preferences.
*   Giver UI: Clear explanation of how gift suggestions are generated. Ability to override system recommendations.
