## Dynamic Content Stitching based on User Device Capabilities

**Specification:** A system to dynamically assemble video content based on detected user device characteristics *prior* to streaming initiation, going beyond bitrate adaptation.

**Concept:** The current patent focuses on adapting to *network* congestion. This system shifts focus to proactively tailoring content *to the user's device* before any streaming begins, offering a more personalized and efficient experience. It goes beyond simply selecting a bitrate; it adjusts the content itself.

**Components:**

1.  **Device Profiler:** This module, residing on the CDN edge or client-side (with appropriate privacy considerations), analyzes the requesting device's capabilities:
    *   Processing power (CPU/GPU)
    *   Screen resolution & pixel density
    *   Supported codecs
    *   Memory (RAM)
    *   Connectivity type (WiFi, 5G, etc.) & estimated bandwidth *before* connection establishment.
2.  **Content Library:**  A repository storing multiple versions of content segments.  These versions *aren't* just different bitrates. They encompass:
    *   **Resolution variations:**  Beyond standard HD/4K, including lower-resolution tiles or regions.
    *   **Frame rate options:** 24fps, 30fps, 60fps, potentially utilizing motion interpolation.
    *   **Codec selections:** H.264, H.265, AV1, VP9 â€“ tailored to device decoding capabilities.
    *   **Complexity levels:** Lower detail models for simpler devices, higher detail for powerful ones.  (Think simplified textures, fewer polygons, reduced particle effects.)
    *   **Region of Interest (ROI) encoding:** Higher quality encoding for areas the user is likely to focus on (e.g., faces, action sequences).
3.  **Dynamic Stitcher:** A server-side component that, upon receiving a request:
    *   Receives device profile from Device Profiler.
    *   Selects appropriate content segments from Content Library based on device profile.
    *   Stitches together segments into a unified manifest (e.g., DASH, HLS).
    *   Delivers the personalized manifest to the client.
4.  **Client Player:**  A modified video player capable of receiving and processing the dynamically generated manifest.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Stitcher):**

```
function stitchManifest(deviceProfile, contentID):
  deviceCapabilities = parseDeviceProfile(deviceProfile)
  resolution = deviceCapabilities.screenResolution
  codec = deviceCapabilities.supportedCodecs[0] // Select preferred codec
  processingPower = deviceCapabilities.processingPower

  // Select content segments based on capabilities
  segments = selectSegments(contentID, resolution, codec, processingPower)

  // Create manifest (DASH/HLS)
  manifest = createManifest(segments)

  return manifest
```

**Example Scenario:**

A user with a low-end mobile device requests a live sporting event. The system detects the device's limited processing power and screen resolution. Instead of sending a high-bitrate 4K stream, the Dynamic Stitcher assembles a manifest containing:

*   Lower-resolution video segments.
*   H.264 encoded video (as the device may not support newer codecs).
*   A reduced frame rate.
*   Simplified graphics overlays.

This results in a smooth, watchable experience *without* overwhelming the device.  A user with a high-end VR headset would receive a completely different manifest, maximizing visual fidelity and immersion.
