## Dynamic Heatmap Layering for Multi-Attribute Visual Search & Editing

**Concept:** Expand the pixel range identification and attention score system to create a dynamic, layered heatmap system for both visual search *and* image editing. Instead of just *showing* the heatmap for a single attribute, allow the user to interactively layer and adjust heatmaps for *multiple* attributes simultaneously, directly manipulating the image based on the attention scores.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Data Structure:** `AttributeHeatmapLayer`
    *   `attributeName`: String (e.g., "Sleeve Length", "Collar Type", "Stitching")
    *   `heatmapData`: 2D Array (Normalized attention scores – 0.0 to 1.0)
    *   `opacity`: Float (0.0 to 1.0 – layer visibility)
    *   `colorScheme`: Enum (e.g., "Red-Yellow", "Blue-Green", "Grayscale")
    *   `blendMode`: Enum (e.g., "Overlay", "Multiply", "Screen")

*   **Image Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  **Input:** Source Image.
    2.  **Attribute Detection:** Run existing attention model(s) to generate `heatmapData` for each detectable attribute.  Expand the model to support a wider range of attributes (tagging/training data critical).
    3.  **Layer Creation:**  For each attribute, create an `AttributeHeatmapLayer` instance.
    4.  **Layer Blending:** Apply the layers sequentially, using the specified `blendMode` and `opacity`. This creates a composite heatmap visualization.
    5.  **Output:** Composite heatmap overlayed on the source image.

*   **User Interface:**
    1.  **Layer Panel:**  A UI panel listing all detected attributes with corresponding `AttributeHeatmapLayer` controls.
    2.  **Layer Controls:** For each layer:
        *   Visibility Toggle (On/Off)
        *   Opacity Slider (0.0 - 1.0)
        *   Color Scheme Selection
        *   Blend Mode Selection
    3.  **Interactive Editing:**
        *   **Brush Tool:** Allow users to directly paint onto the image with attention scores.  This overrides the model’s attention output in the painted area.
        *   **Selection Tool:** Allow users to select areas of the image and adjust the attention score for a specific attribute within that selection.
        *   **Attribute-Aware Filtering:** A filter that highlights regions of the image based on a threshold for a given attribute's attention score.

*   **Pseudocode (Layer Blending):**

```pseudocode
function blendLayers(sourceImage, layers):
    compositeImage = sourceImage.copy()
    for layer in layers:
        if layer.opacity > 0:
            heatmap = layer.heatmapData
            for x in range(imageWidth):
                for y in range(imageHeight):
                    attentionScore = heatmap[x][y]
                    color = getColorFromAttentionScore(attentionScore)
                    compositeImage[x][y] = blendColors(compositeImage[x][y], color, layer.blendMode, layer.opacity)
    return compositeImage
```

*   **Downstream Applications:**
    *   **Advanced Visual Search:**  Users can specify multiple attributes and their relative importance (opacity) to refine search results.
    *   **AI-Assisted Image Editing:**  Automated adjustments to image properties (color, contrast, sharpness) based on the layered heatmaps.  e.g., automatically sharpen the details in areas identified as “fabric texture”.
    *   **Content Creation Tools:**  Tools for artists and designers to manipulate images with precise control over specific attributes.
    *   **Augmented Reality:**  Real-time attribute detection and overlay in AR applications.
