## Adaptive Attestation & Dynamic Key Derivation

**Concept:** Extend the existing attestation & key management system to allow for dynamic key derivation *based on device state*, not just initial attestation. This enables keys tailored to *current* security posture, rather than relying solely on a snapshot in time.

**Specs:**

1.  **State Sensors:** Integrate a set of ‘state sensors’ into the device’s secure enclave. These sensors monitor critical device parameters:
    *   RAM integrity (via memory checksumming/ECC monitoring).
    *   Storage health (SMART data, bad block counts).
    *   Bootloader version & integrity.
    *   Kernel version & integrity.
    *   Network connection state (trusted Wi-Fi, VPN active).
    *   Peripheral device connections (USB, Bluetooth – with potential for device-specific attestation).

2.  **State Vector Generation:** The secure enclave aggregates sensor data into a ‘state vector’ – a numerical representation of the device's current configuration and health.  This vector is timestamped.

3.  **Dynamic Key Derivation Function (DKDF):** Implement a DKDF within the secure enclave. Input to the DKDF:
    *   The attestation certificate (initial trust anchor).
    *   The current state vector.
    *   A seed key (established during initial device provisioning/manufacturing).
    *   A ‘key usage hint’ (provided by the client application requesting the artifact.  Examples: ‘Network Communication’, ‘Data Encryption’, ‘Secure Boot’).

    The DKDF outputs a derived key specifically for that session and purpose.

4.  **Artifact Signing:** The authentication artifact is signed using the derived key, *not* the static private device key.

5.  **Ephemeral Key Rotation:** Implement a configurable rotation period for the derived key. After the period expires (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour), a new state vector is captured, and a new derived key is generated for subsequent artifact signing requests.  This mitigates the risk of long-lived compromised keys.

6.  **State Vector Validation:** The client application receiving the signed artifact *also* receives a hash of the state vector used to derive the signing key. The client can request the full state vector from the device for further analysis if desired.  This provides transparency and allows for risk-based decision-making.

**Pseudocode (Secure Enclave):**

```
function generate_artifact_key(attestation_cert, state_vector, seed_key, key_usage_hint):
  // Hash inputs to generate a unique derivation key
  derivation_key = SHA256(attestation_cert + state_vector + seed_key + key_usage_hint)
  
  // Use a Key Derivation Function (KDF) like HKDF or PBKDF2
  derived_key = HKDF(derivation_key, "Artifact Signing", salt)
  
  return derived_key

function sign_artifact(artifact, attestation_cert, state_vector, seed_key, key_usage_hint):
  derived_key = generate_artifact_key(attestation_cert, state_vector, seed_key, key_usage_hint)
  signature = ECDSA_Sign(artifact, derived_key)
  return signature, state_vector_hash
```

**Rationale:**

This design moves beyond static trust anchors to a dynamic trust model. By incorporating device state into key derivation, it creates keys that are sensitive to changes in the device's security posture. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to compromise the system, even if they can obtain initial access or manipulate certain device components. The ephemeral key rotation adds another layer of security, minimizing the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit compromised keys.
