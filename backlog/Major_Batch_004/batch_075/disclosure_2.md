## Dynamic Network Slice 'Chaining' for Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend network slice allocation beyond simple assignment. Implement a system where slices can be dynamically 'chained' together based on *predicted* application behavior, creating composite slices tailored to anticipated needs *before* resources are fully committed. This enables proactive resource allocation and significantly reduces latency associated with dynamic slice creation/modification.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Behavior Engine:**

*   **Input:** Application profile data (historical usage patterns, declared QoS requirements, anticipated data volume, geographic location), network conditions (congestion levels, available bandwidth, cell site load), user behavior predictions (based on time of day, location, etc.).
*   **Processing:** Employ machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks) to predict future application resource demands (bandwidth, latency, processing power).  Output a 'demand forecast' representing predicted resource needs over a defined time horizon (e.g., 5-30 seconds).
*   **Output:** A resource demand vector (bandwidth, latency, CPU, memory) and a 'confidence score' indicating the reliability of the prediction.

**2. Slice Chain Construction Module:**

*   **Input:** Resource demand vector, confidence score, available network slice templates (pre-configured slices with different QoS characteristics), current network state.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Based on the resource demand vector, identify a set of candidate network slice templates that can potentially meet the application’s requirements.
    *   Construct multiple 'slice chains' by linking together these templates.  Each chain represents a possible configuration of network slices.
    *   Evaluate each slice chain based on its ability to meet the application’s QoS requirements, cost, and network resource utilization. Utilize a cost function incorporating both resource usage and predicted performance.
*   **Output:** An optimized slice chain configuration, including the sequence of network slices, their allocated resources, and associated costs.

**3. Proactive Resource Allocation & Orchestration:**

*   **Input:** Optimized slice chain configuration, current network state.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Pre-allocate the necessary network resources (bandwidth, computing capacity) for each slice in the chain.  This allocation happens *before* the application generates traffic.
    *   Orchestrate the network functions and resources to create the composite slice chain.
    *   Implement a monitoring system to track actual application behavior and compare it to the predicted behavior.  
    *   Implement a feedback loop that adjusts the slice chain configuration and resource allocation in real-time based on the observed discrepancies. (e.g., dynamically scaling resources, adding or removing slices from the chain).
*   **Output:** Active, dynamically adjusted composite network slice tailored to the application's predicted and observed needs.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// Application requests service
request = application.request_service()

// Predict future resource needs
prediction = predictive_engine.predict(request)

// Build potential slice chains
chains = slice_chain_builder.build_chains(prediction)

// Select optimal chain
optimal_chain = chain_selector.select_chain(chains)

// Pre-allocate resources
resource_allocator.allocate(optimal_chain)

// Activate slice
slice_activator.activate(optimal_chain)

// Monitor & adjust
while (application is active) {
  actual_usage = monitor.get_usage()
  discrepancy = compare(actual_usage, prediction)
  if (discrepancy > threshold) {
    adjusted_chain = adjuster.adjust(discrepancy)
    resource_allocator.reallocate(adjusted_chain)
  }
}
```
