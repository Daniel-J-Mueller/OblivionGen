## Dynamic Symptom Weighting & Proactive Client Profiling

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Shift from reactive error reporting to proactive issue prediction by dynamically weighting symptom occurrences *across all clients* and building individual client risk profiles. This moves beyond simply matching reported symptoms to known errors and begins anticipating issues *before* they are explicitly reported.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Global Symptom Database (GSD):** A centralized repository storing all symptom occurrences reported by any client. Each symptom entry is timestamped and linked to the client ID.
*   **Dynamic Weighting Algorithm (DWA):** This algorithm runs periodically (e.g., hourly) and calculates a weight for each symptom based on its recent frequency and correlation with known errors.
    *   **Frequency Component:** Higher frequency = higher initial weight. Exponential decay applied to older occurrences.
    *   **Correlation Component:**  Calculates correlation between symptom occurrences and subsequent error reports (using the GSD). Strong correlation increases weight.
    *   **Novelty Detection:**  A component to identify and flag symptom combinations *not* previously seen. These receive a temporary high weight for early analysis.
*   **Client Risk Profiler (CRP):** Each client has a profile storing:
    *   Historical symptom occurrences.
    *   Weighted symptom scores (based on DWA and CRP data).
    *   Predicted risk score (calculated from weighted symptom scores and historical error rates).
*   **Proactive Notification Engine (PNE):**  Triggers alerts or initiates support actions when a clientâ€™s risk score exceeds a predefined threshold.

**III. Data Flow & Pseudocode:**

1.  **Error/Symptom Reporting:** Client reports error + symptoms (textual description).
2.  **Symptom Extraction:** NLP processes description to extract individual symptoms (keywords).
3.  **GSD Update:** Symptoms and client ID logged in GSD.
4.  **DWA Execution (Periodic):**

```pseudocode
function dynamicWeightingAlgorithm(GSD):
  symptom_counts = calculateSymptomFrequencies(GSD)
  correlation_matrix = calculateSymptomCorrelations(GSD)

  for symptom in symptom_counts:
    weight = symptom_counts[symptom] * correlation_matrix[symptom]
    // Apply novelty bonus if symptom is rare
    if (symptom_count < threshold):
      weight *= novelty_bonus_factor
    update_symptom_weight(symptom, weight)
```

5.  **CRP Update (Real-time):**

```pseudocode
function updateClientRiskProfile(client_id, reported_symptoms):
  for symptom in reported_symptoms:
    // Get symptom weight from DWA
    weight = get_symptom_weight(symptom)
    // Update client profile
    client_profile[symptom] += weight
  // Calculate risk score
  risk_score = sum(client_profile.values())
  // Store risk score
  store_risk_score(client_id, risk_score)
```

6.  **PNE Execution (Continuous):**

```pseudocode
function proactiveNotificationEngine():
  for client_id in all_clients:
    risk_score = get_risk_score(client_id)
    if (risk_score > threshold):
      // Trigger alert or initiate support ticket
      send_alert(client_id, risk_score)
```

**IV.  Novel Aspects:**

*   **Global Symptom Database:**  Leverages data from *all* clients to build a more accurate understanding of emerging issues.
*   **Dynamic Weighting Algorithm:** Adapts to changing patterns of errors and symptoms, improving prediction accuracy.
*   **Proactive Notification Engine:**  Shifts from reactive support to proactive issue resolution.  This allows for preemptive fixes before issues significantly impact the client.
