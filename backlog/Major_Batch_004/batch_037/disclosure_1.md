## Adaptive Key Aging & Behavioral Profiling

**Specification:** Implement a system that dynamically adjusts key rotation thresholds not just based on operation *count*, but also on *behavioral patterns* observed in key usage. This moves beyond simple thresholds to a proactive, risk-based rotation strategy.

**Components:**

1.  **Usage Monitor:** Tracks all cryptographic operations performed using a given key. Captures data points beyond simple count:
    *   **Operation Type:** Encryption/Decryption/Signing/Verification
    *   **Data Source:** Originating IP address, User Agent, application ID
    *   **Data Sensitivity:** Categorization of data being protected (e.g., PII, financial data, internal memos) - assigned via policy.
    *   **Time of Day/Week:** When operations occur.
    *   **Success/Failure Rate:** Number of successful vs. failed operations.

2.  **Behavioral Profiler:** Uses machine learning (anomaly detection algorithms – e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to establish a ‘normal’ usage profile for each key. This profile is a multi-dimensional representation of the data collected by the Usage Monitor.

3.  **Risk Engine:**  Calculates a 'Risk Score' for each key based on deviations from its normal usage profile. Deviations are weighted based on the severity of the anomaly and the sensitivity of the data protected by the key.  The Risk Engine utilizes the following:
    *   **Anomaly Score:** Output from the Behavioral Profiler.
    *   **Sensitivity Multiplier:** Based on data categorization.
    *   **Time-Based Decay:**  Recent anomalies carry more weight.

4.  **Dynamic Rotation Manager:** Adjusts key rotation thresholds (and triggers immediate rotation) based on the Risk Score. Higher Risk Scores trigger faster rotation.  Implements tiered thresholds:
    *   **Low Risk:** Rotation occurs at the standard interval (defined by policy).
    *   **Medium Risk:** Rotation interval is shortened.
    *   **High Risk:** Immediate rotation.  Alerting is triggered.

5.  **Key Lifecycle Manager:** Handles the generation, storage, rotation, and archiving of keys.  Integrates with the Dynamic Rotation Manager.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop - Runs continuously
For Each Key In KeyList:
    UsageData = UsageMonitor.CollectData(Key)
    AnomalyScore = BehavioralProfiler.CalculateAnomaly(UsageData, Key.BaselineProfile)
    RiskScore = RiskEngine.CalculateRiskScore(AnomalyScore, Key.DataSensitivity, Key.LastAccessTime)

    If RiskScore > HighRiskThreshold:
        RotateKey(Key)  // Trigger immediate rotation
        SendAlert(Key, "High Risk - Immediate Rotation")
    Else If RiskScore > MediumRiskThreshold:
        ShortenRotationInterval(Key)
    Else:
        MaintainRotationInterval(Key)

// Key Rotation Function
Function RotateKey(Key):
    NewKey = KeyLifecycleManager.GenerateNewKey()
    KeyLifecycleManager.ArchiveKey(Key)
    KeyLifecycleManager.ActivateKey(NewKey)
    Key.BaselineProfile = BehavioralProfiler.CreateBaselineProfile(CollectInitialUsageData(NewKey))
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Key Usage Data: Time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus)
*   Key Baseline Profiles:  Persistent storage (e.g., Redis, Cassandra)
*   Risk Scores:  Persistent storage (e.g., Redis, Cassandra)
