**Decentralized Data Authorization with Ephemeral Key Sharing**

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of client-side encryption, but move authorization *away* from centralized key management (even the authorized recipient lists within the patent). Instead, leverage a temporary, decentralized network (think a miniature, permissioned blockchain or distributed hash table) for ephemeral key distribution and revocation.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component: Authorization Node Network (ANN):** A peer-to-peer network, established *before* data encryption, managed by the user initiating the data protection. This is *not* a public blockchain; membership is controlled. Participants would be explicitly designated individuals/devices with whom the user wants to share data.
*   **Key Generation & Distribution:**
    1.  User generates a symmetric encryption key for the data.
    2.  Instead of directly encrypting with recipient keys, the user encrypts a "Key Envelope" containing the symmetric key. This envelope is encrypted using *public* keys of ANN members.
    3.  The Key Envelope is broadcast to the ANN. Each member decrypts their portion.
    4.  Members *re-encrypt* the symmetric key with their *private* key. This creates a chain of encrypted symmetric keys.
    5.  Each ANN member distributes *their* re-encrypted symmetric key to the requesting client. The client needs keys from a *threshold* number of ANN members to decrypt the original symmetric key.
*   **Revocation:** Instead of managing lists, revocation is achieved by ANN members 'withdrawing' their key contribution. This makes the threshold unachievable, effectively revoking access.
*   **Data Storage:** Encrypted data and list of ANN members (public keys) are stored on the content site.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side - Encryption):**

```
function encryptData(data, annMembers) {
  symmetricKey = generateSymmetricKey();
  encryptedData = encryptSymmetric(data, symmetricKey);

  keyEnvelope = encryptSymmetric(symmetricKey, annMembers[0].publicKey); //encrypt with first public key

  for (member in annMembers) {
    keyEnvelope = encryptSymmetric(keyEnvelope, member.publicKey);
  }

  return { encryptedData, keyEnvelope, annMembers };
}

```

**Pseudocode (Client-Side - Decryption):**

```
function decryptData(encryptedData, keyEnvelope, annMembers) {
  //Collect keys from ANN members
  collectedKeys = [];
  for (member in annMembers) {
    //Request key from member (secure channel)
    receivedKey = requestKey(member);
    collectedKeys.push(receivedKey);
  }

  //Decrypt key envelope with collected keys.  Need threshold of keys.
  decryptedSymmetricKey = decryptKeyEnvelope(keyEnvelope, collectedKeys);

  //Decrypt data with symmetric key
  decryptedData = decryptSymmetric(encryptedData, decryptedSymmetricKey);

  return decryptedData;
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   ANN membership and initial key exchange must happen *before* data is encrypted.
*   A threshold signature scheme could be used to enhance security and simplify key management.
*   The ANN could be implemented using a library like libp2p or a lightweight DHT implementation.
*   Consider using a secure channel for key exchange between clients and ANN members.
*   A revocation list, not for revocation itself, but for preventing malicious nodes from joining or participating, is still necessary.
