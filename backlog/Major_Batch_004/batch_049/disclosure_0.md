## Adaptive Contextual Synonym Generation & Predictive Input

**Core Concept:** Extend the synonym replacement idea beyond simple autocorrection to proactively suggest and *integrate* environment-specific terms into user input *before* a correction is even needed. This creates a more fluid, context-aware input experience.

**System Specs:**

*   **Module 1: Predictive Context Engine:**
    *   Input: User keystrokes (real-time), application context (e.g., email, medical record, search), user profile (preferences, history), environmental term database (as defined in the base patent).
    *   Process: As the user types, the engine analyzes keystrokes *and* context. It predicts potential words/phrases the user *might* type, focusing on terms from the environmental database.  It calculates a 'relevance score' based on keystroke similarity, context weight, and user history.  It doesn't wait for a full word to be typed; it starts predicting after 2-3 characters.
    *   Output:  A ranked list of potential terms, with associated relevance scores.

*   **Module 2:  Synonym Integration Layer:**
    *   Input:  Ranked list from Module 1, current user input, confidence threshold.
    *   Process: If a predicted term exceeds a defined confidence threshold, it is *subtly* integrated into the user input *before* a correction is needed. This isn’t a full replacement; it’s a ghosting suggestion.  Example: User types “cardio”. The system ‘ghosts’ “cardiology” – visually dimming it alongside the current input, but allowing the user to continue typing “cardio” if desired.  A very short delay (50-100ms) is introduced to allow for this seamless display. The system also records whether the user accepted the ‘ghosted’ synonym.
    *   Output: Modified user input with potential synonym 'ghosting', acceptance logging.

*   **Module 3:  Dynamic Term Learning:**
    *   Input: User acceptance/rejection data from Module 2, application context.
    *   Process: The system dynamically adjusts term relevance scores and expands the environmental term database based on user behavior.  If a user frequently accepts ‘ghosted’ synonyms, those terms receive a higher relevance score.  If a user consistently rejects suggestions in a specific context, the system learns to avoid them in the future.  The system also periodically queries external knowledge sources to update the database with new terms and definitions.
    *   Output: Updated term database, adjusted relevance scores.

**Pseudocode (Module 2 - Synonym Integration):**

```pseudocode
function integrateSynonym(keystroke, context, termDatabase, confidenceThreshold) {
  predictedTerms = predictTerms(keystroke, context, termDatabase) // Uses Module 1 logic
  for each term in predictedTerms {
    if (term.relevanceScore > confidenceThreshold) {
      displayGhostedSynonym(term.term, keystroke)  // Visually dim and display
      userAction = waitForUserAction(keystroke, term) // Wait for keypress or timeout

      if (userAction == "accept") {
        replaceKeystrokeWithTerm(term)
      } else {
        removeGhostedSynonym()
      }
      logUserAction(term, userAction)
    }
  }
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard processor with sufficient RAM for database storage and real-time processing.
*   Fast storage (SSD) for quick database access.
*   Display capable of supporting subtle visual effects (dimming, highlighting).

**Potential Applications:**

*   Medical transcription
*   Legal document drafting
*   Scientific writing
*   Any application requiring precise and context-aware input.
