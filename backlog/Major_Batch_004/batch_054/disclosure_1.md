## Dynamic Credential Scope Adjustment via Behavioral Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the credential translation system to dynamically adjust the 'request scope' of backend credentials based on real-time user behavior and risk assessment.  Instead of static scopes (interface component, client app, customer, gateway), implement a fluid, behaviorally-derived scope.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Behavioral Monitoring Module:**  An integrated module to monitor API call patterns, data access patterns, and timing characteristics of each frontend credential (user/application). Data points include:
    *   Frequency of calls to specific backend services.
    *   Data volume accessed per service.
    *   Time of day and day of week of access.
    *   Deviation from established baseline behavior.
    *   Geographic location of requests (if applicable).

2.  **Risk Scoring Engine:** A real-time risk scoring engine that assigns a risk score based on the behavioral data. This engine employs machine learning (anomaly detection, classification) to identify potentially malicious or unauthorized activity.  The score is normalized (e.g., 0-100).

3.  **Dynamic Scope Adjustment Policy:** Define a policy that maps risk score ranges to specific scope adjustments.  Examples:
    *   Risk Score 0-30:  Default scope (e.g., Customer).
    *   Risk Score 31-60:  Restricted scope (e.g., Read-only access to specific data).
    *   Risk Score 61-80:  Highly Restricted scope (e.g., Access limited to a single backend service).
    *   Risk Score 81-100:  Block access.

4.  **Credential Translation Table Enhancement:** Modify the credential translation table to include a 'Dynamic Scope Override' field. This field stores the currently assigned scope based on the risk score. The API gateway uses this field *in addition to* the default scope when authorizing requests.

5.  **API Workflow:**
    1.  Client application makes API request with frontend credentials.
    2.  API gateway identifies the frontend credentials and queries the Behavioral Monitoring Module for recent activity.
    3.  Behavioral Monitoring Module returns activity data to the Risk Scoring Engine.
    4.  Risk Scoring Engine calculates a risk score.
    5.  API gateway retrieves the default scope and the Dynamic Scope Override from the credential translation table.
    6.  The API gateway uses the *more restrictive* of the default scope and the Dynamic Scope Override to authorize access to the backend service.
    7.  Activity data is logged for future analysis and refinement of the risk scoring model.

**Pseudocode (API Gateway Authorization Logic):**

```
function authorizeRequest(frontendCredential, backendService) {
  defaultScope = getScopeFromTranslationTable(frontendCredential, backendService)
  dynamicScopeOverride = getDynamicScope(frontendCredential)  // From Behavioral Module
  effectiveScope = determineMoreRestrictiveScope(defaultScope, dynamicScopeOverride)

  if (effectiveScope == "Blocked") {
    return "Access Denied"
  }

  backendCredential = getBackendCredentialFromTranslationTable(frontendCredential, backendService, effectiveScope)
  if (backendCredential == null) {
    return "Access Denied"
  }

  // Authorize request with backendCredential
  return "Access Granted"
}
```

**Potential Improvements/Extensions:**

*   Implement adaptive learning for the risk scoring model.
*   Integrate with threat intelligence feeds.
*   Allow administrators to customize risk thresholds and scope adjustments.
*   Provide real-time alerts for suspicious activity.
