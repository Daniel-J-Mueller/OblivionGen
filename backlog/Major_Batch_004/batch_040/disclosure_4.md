## Dynamic Resource Allocation with Predictive Skill-Gap Analysis & Automated Training Assignment

**Concept:** Expand the resource prediction simulation to incorporate *skill* as a resource dimension. Not just *how many* people, but *what can they do*?  Introduce predictive skill-gap analysis based on projected tasking *and* employee development trajectories, triggering automated training assignment to proactively address resource capability deficiencies *before* they impact project timelines.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Skill Profile Database:**
    *   Data Structure:  Employee ID | Skill Name | Proficiency Level (1-5) | Last Certified Date | Recommended Recertification Interval (months) | Training History.  Proficiency levels are dynamically updated via performance data (see point 5).
    *   Scalability: Database designed to handle 10,000+ employee profiles with efficient querying by skill and proficiency.

2.  **Task Skill Matrix:**
    *   Data Structure: Task ID | Required Skill Name | Minimum Proficiency Level.  Maintained via task definition process.
    *   API:  Allows programmatic access for skill requirement retrieval.

3.  **Projected Tasking Input:**  System accepts project plans (e.g., MS Project, Jira exports) outlining tasks, duration, and required resources.  Includes dependency mapping.

4.  **Skill Gap Analysis Engine:**
    *   Algorithm:
        1.  For each task, identify required skills and minimum proficiency.
        2.  Query Skill Profile Database for employees with matching skills.
        3.  Filter employees based on proficiency level meeting or exceeding requirement.
        4.  Calculate *available capacity* (hours/week) for qualified employees.
        5.  If capacity is insufficient to cover task duration, flag a skill gap.
        6.  Prioritize skill gaps based on project criticality and task start date.
    *   Output:  Skill Gap Report – Skill Name | Gap Quantity (FTE) | Project Impacted | Urgency Level.

5.  **Performance Data Integration:**  Real-time integration with performance management systems (e.g., 360 reviews, project completion rates, code quality metrics) to dynamically adjust employee proficiency levels.  Machine learning models used to predict skill decay over time.

6.  **Automated Training Assignment Module:**
    *   Training Catalog Integration:  Connects to internal/external training platforms (e.g., Coursera, Udemy, internal LMS).
    *   Recommendation Engine:  Based on skill gap analysis and employee performance data, recommends appropriate training courses.  Considers employee preferences (e.g., learning style, available time).
    *   Automated Enrollment:  With employee consent, automatically enrolls employees in recommended training courses.
    *   Progress Tracking: Monitors training completion rates and assesses skill improvement via post-training assessments.

7.  **Simulation Visualizations:**
    *   Enhanced Gantt Charts:  Visually represent skill gaps alongside project timelines.  Color-coding indicates gap severity.
    *   Resource Heatmaps:  Display skill distribution across the organization.  Identify areas of skill concentration and scarcity.
    *   "What-If" Scenarios: Allow users to simulate the impact of different training investments on resource capacity and project outcomes.

**Pseudocode (Skill Gap Analysis Engine – Core Logic):**

```
FUNCTION analyzeSkillGap(projectPlan, skillProfileDatabase):
  skillGaps = []
  FOR EACH task IN projectPlan:
    requiredSkills = getRequiredSkills(task)
    qualifiedEmployees = findQualifiedEmployees(requiredSkills, skillProfileDatabase)
    availableCapacity = calculateAvailableCapacity(qualifiedEmployees, taskDuration)
    IF availableCapacity < taskEffort:
      gapQuantity = taskEffort - availableCapacity
      gapReport = {
        skillName: skillName,
        gapQuantity: gapQuantity,
        projectImpacted: task.projectName,
        urgencyLevel: calculateUrgency(task.startDate)
      }
      skillGaps.append(gapReport)
  RETURN skillGaps
```

**Data Flow Diagram (Simplified):**

[Project Plan] --> [Skill Gap Analysis Engine] --> [Skill Gap Report]

[Performance Data] --> [Skill Profile Database (Update Proficiency)]

**Scalability Considerations:** System designed for distributed processing and utilizes cloud-based infrastructure to handle large datasets and high user loads. Microservices architecture allows for independent scaling of individual components.
