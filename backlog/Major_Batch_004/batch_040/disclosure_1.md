## Dynamic Recursive Tunneling for Adaptive Network Resilience

**Concept:** Extend the tunneling approach described in the patent to create a recursively adaptable network topology. Instead of static tunnels established *to* border routers, implement a system where tunnels are dynamically created *between* network border routers *and* endpoint devices, forming a mesh-like, self-healing overlay network. This aims to improve resilience, reduce reliance on central routing services, and potentially lower latency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Adaptive Tunnel Broker (ATB):**

*   **Function:**  A distributed service (implemented on dedicated hardware or virtual machines) responsible for establishing and maintaining dynamic tunnels.  Each ATB instance ‘knows’ about a subset of the overall network topology.
*   **Discovery:** ATBs discover each other through a gossip protocol (similar to Chord or similar DHT implementation) and maintain a partial view of the network topology.
*   **Tunnel Request Handling:** Endpoint devices (and potentially border routers) send requests to the nearest ATB instance to establish a tunnel to a destination endpoint or border router.
*   **Path Computation:** ATB instances use a distributed path computation algorithm (e.g., based on link-state routing or distance-vector routing) to determine the optimal tunnel path.  Path cost considers latency, bandwidth, and link reliability.
*   **Tunnel Establishment:**  ATB instances orchestrate tunnel establishment using existing IP tunneling technologies (e.g., GRE, VXLAN, Geneve).  Each tunnel is assigned a unique identifier.
*   **Health Monitoring:** ATBs actively monitor tunnel health using ICMP probes and application-level heartbeats.  If a tunnel fails, ATBs automatically initiate tunnel re-establishment.

**2. Recursive Tunneling Protocol (RTP):**

*   **Tunnel Segment Creation:** Tunnels aren't created end-to-end. Instead, they are created as segments between neighboring nodes (endpoint devices or border routers).
*   **Segment Advertisement:** Each node advertises its available tunnel segments to its neighbors.
*   **Dynamic Path Stitching:** When a source node needs to reach a destination node, it queries its neighbors for tunnel segments that lead closer to the destination. It then stitches together multiple tunnel segments to form a complete path.
*   **Segment Prioritization:** Segments are prioritized based on their cost (latency, bandwidth, reliability). This allows for the selection of the optimal path.
*   **Path Diversity:** The system maintains multiple paths between any two nodes. This provides redundancy and resilience in case of link failures.
*    **Flow Control:** Per-tunnel flow control mechanisms prevent congestion and ensure fair bandwidth allocation.

**3. Border Router Integration:**

*   **Tunnel Endpoint:** Border routers act as endpoints for dynamic tunnels. They can receive and forward packets through these tunnels.
*   **Routing Advertisement:** Border routers advertise their connectivity to the ATBs and provide information about their transit provider connections.
*    **Security:** Border routers implement security measures (e.g., authentication, encryption) to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the tunneled traffic.

**Pseudocode (ATB – Tunnel Request Handling):**

```
function handleTunnelRequest(source, destination):
  path = computePath(destination) // Distributed path computation algorithm
  if path == null:
    return error("No path to destination")

  tunnelSegments = segmentPath(path) // Break path into tunnel segments

  for segment in tunnelSegments:
    if segment.exists() == false:
      establishTunnel(segment) // Initiate tunnel creation

  return success(tunnelSegments) // Return list of tunnel segments
```

**Novelty:** This design diverges from the patent’s centralized routing service approach. It creates a more distributed, self-healing network topology.  The recursive tunneling protocol and dynamic tunnel establishment process are distinct from the static tunnel configurations described in the patent. This creates a network that's capable of adapting to changing conditions without requiring intervention from a central authority.
