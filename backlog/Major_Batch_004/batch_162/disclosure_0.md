**Dynamic Workload ‘Shadowing’ and Predictive Resource Allocation**

**Concept:** Extend the existing recommendation system to *actively* monitor currently running workloads (with user permission) exhibiting similar resource utilization patterns to a new request. Instead of solely relying on declared workload characteristics, leverage real-time data from ‘shadow’ workloads to refine resource recommendations *during* the provisioning process.

**Specifications:**

*   **Shadow Workload Identification:**
    *   System maintains a database of anonymized resource utilization profiles of running workloads (CPU, memory, storage I/O, network bandwidth – historical and real-time).
    *   New workload requests undergo initial categorization based on user-provided input (as per existing patent).
    *   System queries the database for workloads matching the initial category *and* exhibiting similar near-real-time resource usage patterns (e.g., CPU spikes, memory leaks, network bursts).  Similarity is calculated using a weighted metric incorporating resource usage rates, variance, and correlation.
    *   A 'shadow pool' of 3-5 closest matching workloads is selected.

*   **Dynamic Resource Adjustment:**
    *   As the new workload is being provisioned, its initial resource allocation (based on the primary recommendation) is actively monitored.
    *   Resource usage data from the shadow workloads is streamed into a predictive model (e.g., a time-series forecasting algorithm).
    *   The model forecasts the resource requirements of the new workload over the next 5-15 minutes, taking into account the behaviors observed in the shadow workloads.
    *   Based on the prediction, the system dynamically adjusts the resource allocation of the new workload *during* provisioning.  For example:
        *   If the prediction indicates a potential CPU spike, CPU cores are proactively allocated.
        *   If memory usage is predicted to exceed the initial allocation, memory is dynamically added.
        *   If I/O bottlenecks are anticipated, storage bandwidth is increased.

*   **Feedback Loop & Model Refinement:**
    *   Actual resource utilization data from the new workload is fed back into the predictive model to refine its accuracy over time.
    *   The system automatically identifies patterns and anomalies in workload behavior that can be used to improve future recommendations and resource allocation decisions.

*   **User Interface Considerations:**
    *   Users are presented with a “Dynamic Allocation” toggle. Enabled by default but can be disabled.
    *   A real-time dashboard displays resource utilization data for the new workload and its shadow counterparts.
    *   Users receive notifications when dynamic resource adjustments are made, along with explanations of the reasons behind those adjustments.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Allocation Module):**

```
function allocateResources(workloadRequest):
  initialRecommendation = getRecommendation(workloadRequest)
  provisionVM(initialRecommendation)
  enableDynamicAllocation(workloadRequest)

function enableDynamicAllocation(workloadRequest):
  shadowWorkloads = findShadowWorkloads(workloadRequest)
  startMonitoring(workloadRequest, shadowWorkloads)

function startMonitoring(workloadRequest, shadowWorkloads):
  while running:
    workloadData = getRealtimeResourceData(workloadRequest)
    shadowData = getRealtimeResourceData(shadowWorkloads)
    predictedData = forecastResourceUsage(workloadData, shadowData)
    if predictedData > currentAllocation:
      increaseAllocation(workloadRequest, predictedData)
    elif predictedData < currentAllocation:
      decreaseAllocation(workloadRequest, predictedData) # optional - could maintain existing allocation
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond static recommendation to *active*, real-time resource optimization based on observable workload behaviors.  The 'shadowing' concept and dynamic adjustment during provisioning represent a significant advancement over existing approaches.
