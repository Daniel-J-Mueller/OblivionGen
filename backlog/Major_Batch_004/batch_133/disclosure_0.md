## Adaptive Network Prioritization via Bioacoustic Analysis

**Concept:** Leverage ambient sound analysis to dynamically prioritize network selection, beyond simple signal strength or pre-defined preferences. The user device assesses the acoustic environment, infers the user's likely activity, and prioritizes networks known to support that activity, or networks with characteristics best suited for clear voice/data transmission in that environment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Acoustic Environment Profiler (AEP):**

*   **Sensor:** Integrated microphone array (minimum 3 microphones) capable of capturing directional audio.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Real-time audio signal processing to identify dominant sound events. (e.g., speech, music, vehicle noise, quiet environments, construction, crowds). Utilize a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., based on YAMNet or similar) for sound event classification.
    *   Sound source localization to determine the direction and approximate distance of sound sources.
    *   Ambient noise level measurement (dB SPL).
    *   Acoustic signature generation – a vector representing the dominant sound events, noise level, and acoustic characteristics of the environment.
*   **Output:** Acoustic signature vector.

**2. Activity Inference Engine (AIE):**

*   **Input:** Acoustic signature vector from the AEP. Potentially integrated with other sensor data (accelerometer, GPS, calendar) for improved accuracy.
*   **Processing:**  A trained machine learning model (e.g., a Random Forest or a Bayesian Network) maps the acoustic signature to likely user activities. Example activities:
    *   **Voice Call:** High probability if clear speech is detected.
    *   **Music Streaming:** High probability if music is detected.
    *   **Video Conferencing:**  Clear speech + potential background noise typical of an office/home.
    *   **Outdoor Activity/Navigation:** Environmental sounds (wind, traffic), GPS location.
    *   **Public Transportation:** Specific sounds characteristic of buses, trains, etc.
*   **Output:**  Probabilistic activity profile (e.g., 80% Voice Call, 10% Music Streaming, 10% Navigation).

**3. Dynamic Network Prioritization Module (DNPM):**

*   **Input:** Probabilistic activity profile from the AIE, current network signal strength information (RSSI, RSRP, etc.), and a network performance database (described below).
*   **Network Performance Database:** A cloud-based database storing historical performance data for each network (PLMN) in a given region. Data includes:
    *   Average data throughput for different activity types (Voice, Video, Streaming, etc.).
    *   Latency measurements.
    *   Packet loss rates.
    *   Signal quality metrics.
    *   User-reported performance feedback.
*   **Processing:**
    1.  The DNPM calculates a "relevance score" for each available network, based on its historical performance for the inferred user activity.
    2.  The relevance score is weighted by the user's pre-defined network preferences (if any).
    3.  The DNPM dynamically adjusts the network scan order and connection priorities, favoring networks with the highest relevance scores.  This is achieved via modification of the modem’s internal scanning and selection algorithms.
*   **Output:** Dynamic network scan order and connection priorities.

**Pseudocode (DNPM Processing):**

```
function prioritizeNetworks(activityProfile, signalStrengths, networkDatabase) {
  networkScores = {}
  for each network in availableNetworks {
    baseScore = networkDatabase.getPerformanceScore(network, activityProfile)
    score = baseScore * signalStrengths[network] // Combine performance and signal
    networkScores[network] = score
  }

  sortedNetworks = sort(networkScores, descending) // Sort by score

  return sortedNetworks // Return prioritized network list
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Crowdsourced Acoustic Mapping:** Users contribute acoustic data to build a more detailed acoustic map of different locations.
*   **Predictive Network Selection:** Use machine learning to predict the optimal network based on the user’s historical behavior and location.
*   **Integration with Voice Assistants:** Allow users to explicitly specify their activity to further refine network selection.
