## Dynamic Key Orchestration via Biofeedback

**Core Concept:** Integrate real-time biometric data from communicating parties to dynamically adjust key generation and exchange frequencies, enhancing security by linking encryption strength to authenticated presence and engagement.

**Specifications:**

**1. Biometric Sensor Integration:**

*   **Input:**  Data streams from integrated or paired biometric sensors. Acceptable sensor types:
    *   Electrocardiogram (ECG) – Heart rate variability as a presence indicator.
    *   Electroencephalogram (EEG) – Brainwave activity indicative of cognitive engagement.
    *   Facial Muscle Activity (fMA) – Micro-expression detection for liveness verification.
    *   Voice Analysis – Stress/emotion detection (used *in conjunction* with other modalities – not standalone).
*   **Preprocessing:** Raw sensor data is processed to remove noise and artifacts.  Algorithms include:
    *   Digital filtering (Butterworth, Kalman).
    *   Baseline wander correction (ECG).
    *   Artifact rejection (spike/outlier detection).
*   **Feature Extraction:**  Extracted features represent a 'biometric signature'.  Examples:
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) – statistical measures of beat-to-beat interval variations.
    *   Alpha/Theta wave power (EEG) – correlate with relaxed/focused attention.
    *   Micro-expression timestamps & intensity (fMA).

**2. Dynamic Key Schedule Algorithm:**

*   **Initialization:**  A base encryption key is established via a standard protocol (e.g., Diffie-Hellman).
*   **Biometric Trigger:**  A ‘biometric threshold’ is defined. This represents the minimum acceptable biometric signal strength/consistency to maintain the current key schedule.
*   **Key Refresh Frequency:** The frequency of key refreshment is dynamically adjusted based on biometric signal consistency.
    *   **High Consistency (Signal strong and stable):** Key refresh interval *decreases*. Encryption strength increases.
    *   **Low Consistency (Signal weak/erratic):** Key refresh interval *increases*. Encryption strength decreases. A warning is triggered.
    *   **Signal Loss:** Communication is automatically terminated.
*   **Key Derivation Function (KDF):** The KDF integrates biometric features into the key generation process.
    *   Input: Base key, Biometric Feature Vector, Random Nonce.
    *   Output: Derived Encryption Key.
    *   Algorithm: Argon2id recommended for resistance to side-channel attacks.
*   **Adaptive Nonce Generation:**  The nonce is seeded with biometric data, further linking the key to the user’s authenticated presence.
*    **Biometric Drift Detection:** Monitors biometric signals for significant deviations over time, indicating potential spoofing or compromised presence.

**3. Communication Protocol:**

*   **Handshake Phase:**  Initial biometric data is exchanged to establish a baseline biometric signature.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Biometric data is continuously monitored throughout the communication session.
*   **Biometric Authentication:** Before each key refresh, biometric data is re-authenticated against the baseline signature.
*   **Secure Channel:**  All biometric data is transmitted over a secure, encrypted channel.

**Pseudocode (Key Refresh Logic):**

```
function refreshKey(baseKey, biometricData, nonce):
  biometricScore = calculateBiometricScore(biometricData)
  if biometricScore < biometricThreshold:
    // Signal degradation detected
    warning("Biometric signal weak - reducing encryption strength")
    refreshInterval = increase(refreshInterval, degradationFactor)
  else:
    refreshInterval = decrease(refreshInterval, enhancementFactor)
  derivedKey = KDF(baseKey, biometricData, nonce)
  return derivedKey
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Integrated biometric sensors (or paired devices with sensors).
*   Secure Enclave/Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for secure key storage and cryptographic operations.
*   Sufficient processing power for real-time biometric data processing and cryptographic calculations.
