**Vehicle Occupant Wellness System - Biofeedback Integration**

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate existing accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and barometer with the following:
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor – integrated into a seatbelt clasp or headrest. Measures heart rate variability (HRV).
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor – integrated into seat material or armrest. Measures skin conductivity, indicating emotional arousal.
    *   Capacitive sensor - integrated into steering wheel or armrest. Measures subtle muscle tension.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated embedded system within the vehicle's central processing unit, or a dedicated edge computing device.
*   **Communication:** Wireless communication (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) to transmit data to a central processing unit.
*   **Data Fusion Algorithm:**  A Kalman filter-based algorithm for fusing data from all sensors.  Prioritize barometer/motion data for position, then integrate biofeedback data.
*   **Machine Learning Model:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a dataset of driver/passenger physiological responses correlated with driving conditions (acceleration, braking, turning, traffic density, weather).
*   **Actuators:**
    *   Haptic Feedback System - integrated into seat and steering wheel.
    *   Ambient Lighting Control - adjustable color and intensity.
    *   Audio System Control - adjustable volume and music selection.
    *   Climate Control - localized temperature adjustments.

**Innovation Description:**

The system monitors occupant physiological state in real-time and proactively adjusts vehicle settings to mitigate stress and enhance wellbeing. 

1.  **Baseline Establishment:** Upon vehicle start, the system establishes a baseline physiological profile for each occupant.
2.  **Real-Time Monitoring:**  Continuous monitoring of HRV, GSR, muscle tension, acceleration, and air pressure.
3.  **Stress Detection:** The RNN model analyzes the sensor data to detect indicators of stress, fatigue, or emotional distress.  
4.  **Proactive Intervention:** Based on the detected state:
    *   **Mild Stress:**  Ambient lighting shifts to calming colors (blue/green), music selection adjusts to relaxing genres, and seat haptic feedback provides gentle massage.
    *   **Moderate Stress:** Climate control adjusts temperature and airflow, music tempo slows, and haptic feedback intensity increases.  Alerts passenger/driver with vocal suggestion to relax posture.
    *   **High Stress/Fatigue:** System provides prominent audio/visual alerts. Steering wheel vibrates. Climate control is adjusted to optimal temperatures. System could suggest slowing down and pulling over, and optionally engage autopilot (if equipped).
5.  **Position Awareness Enhancement:** Use the core patent’s positional data to further refine interventions. For example, if a passenger in the back right quadrant exhibits high stress, localized climate control and ambient lighting adjustments can be applied.
6.  **Driver Profiling:** The system learns individual driver stress responses over time, personalizing interventions.
7.  **Data Logging/Reporting:**  Option to log physiological data for personal wellness tracking or insurance purposes (with user consent).
