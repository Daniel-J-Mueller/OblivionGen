## Dynamic SMS Prioritization & Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Leveraging the established NAS connection (as detailed in the patent) not just for SMS delivery confirmation, but as a dynamic channel to negotiate SMS delivery priority *before* transmission, and allocate network resources accordingly. This allows for tiered SMS service, differentiated by latency/reliability guarantees, and potentially monetized.

**Specification:**

**1. UE Components:**

*   **Priority Request Module:** User interface element allowing the sender to assign a priority level to the SMS message (e.g., "Low", "Normal", "High", "Critical").
*   **Resource Negotiation Agent:**  Responsible for communicating the desired priority to the network and negotiating available resources.
*   **Priority Encoding Function:**  Maps priority levels to a numerical value or specific signaling flags to be included in the initial NAS communication.
*   **Dynamic Buffering & Transmission Control:**  Adjusts transmission scheduling based on negotiated priority and resource availability.

**2. Network Components:**

*   **Priority Validation & Resource Manager:**  Receives priority requests from UEs, validates them against service level agreements (SLAs), and determines available network resources.
*   **Resource Allocation Engine:** Dynamically allocates radio resources (e.g., dedicated channels, higher modulation/coding schemes) based on priority and availability.
*   **QoS Enforcement Module:**  Ensures that SMS messages are delivered according to the negotiated QoS parameters.
*   **Billing/Subscription Manager:** Tracks resource usage and bills users accordingly.

**3. Protocol Flow:**

1.  **Priority Request:** User assigns a priority to the SMS. The UE encodes this priority using the Priority Encoding Function.
2.  **NAS Connection Establishment (or Reuse):** UE establishes (or reuses) the NAS connection to the MME.
3.  **Priority Negotiation:** UE sends the encoded priority request to the MME.
4.  **Resource Validation & Allocation:** The MMEâ€™s Priority Validation & Resource Manager validates the request against SLA and available resources.  The Resource Allocation Engine allocates resources accordingly.
5.  **Confirmation/Rejection:** The MME sends a confirmation or rejection message to the UE, indicating the negotiated priority level and associated QoS guarantees.
6.  **SMS Transmission:** The UE transmits the SMS message. The network prioritizes the transmission based on the negotiated QoS.
7.  **Delivery Report & Billing:** The network provides a delivery report to the UE. The Billing/Subscription Manager tracks resource usage and applies charges.

**4. Pseudocode (UE - Resource Negotiation Agent):**

```
function sendSMS(message, priority):
  // Establish/Reuse NAS Connection
  establishNASConnection()

  // Encode Priority
  encodedPriority = encodePriority(priority)

  // Send Priority Request
  sendPriorityRequest(encodedPriority)

  // Receive Confirmation/Rejection
  response = receiveResponse()

  if (response.status == "confirmed"):
    negotiatedPriority = response.priority
    //Transmit SMS with negotiated priority settings
    transmitSMS(message, negotiatedPriority)
  else:
    //Handle rejection (e.g., notify user, suggest lower priority)
    displayErrorMessage("Priority not available. Please try again with a lower priority.")

function encodePriority(priorityLevel):
  // Map priority level to numerical value (e.g., Low=1, Normal=2, High=3, Critical=4)
  if (priorityLevel == "Low"): return 1
  else if (priorityLevel == "Normal"): return 2
  else if (priorityLevel == "High"): return 3
  else if (priorityLevel == "Critical"): return 4
  else: return 0 // Invalid Priority
```

**5. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Dynamic Priority Adjustment:** Allow users to dynamically adjust the priority of a message during transmission (e.g., if a situation changes).
*   **Geographic Prioritization:**  Prioritize messages based on the sender/recipient's location (e.g., emergency alerts).
*   **Application-Based Prioritization:** Allow applications to request a specific priority level for SMS messages (e.g., banking alerts).
*   **Integration with 5G Network Slicing:** Leverage network slicing to provide dedicated resources for high-priority SMS messages.
