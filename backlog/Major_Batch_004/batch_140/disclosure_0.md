## Dynamic Payload Reconstruction for Network Forensics

**Concept:** Expand the existing test packet generation to include a system for dynamically reconstructing fragmented or obfuscated payloads *within* the network device itself, facilitating real-time forensic analysis.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Payload Fragment Reassembly Module:**
    *   Function: Detects and reassembles fragmented payloads based on embedded fragmentation headers (e.g., IP fragmentation, TCP segmentation, custom fragmentation tags).
    *   Implementation: Stateful module tracking fragment sequences. Utilizes a configurable timeout for incomplete reassembly. 
    *   Data Structures: Fragment buffer (circular queue), Fragment metadata (fragment ID, offset, total length, source port, destination port, timestamp).

2.  **Payload Obfuscation Detection & Reversal Module:**
    *   Function: Detects common obfuscation techniques (e.g., XOR encoding, base64 encoding, simple cipher shifts, custom encoding).
    *   Implementation: Signature-based detection combined with heuristic analysis. Employs a configurable library of decoding algorithms.
    *   Data Structures: Obfuscation signature database, Decoding algorithm library, Decoded payload buffer.

3.  **Test Packet Payload Template Library:**
    *   Function: Stores pre-defined payload templates for specific forensic tests. Templates can include known malicious code snippets, standard network probes, or custom data patterns.
    *   Implementation:  Template storage with versioning and metadata (test purpose, expected results, decoding instructions).
    *   Data Structures: Template database, Template metadata (test ID, test name, test description, decoding flags).

4.  **Dynamic Payload Construction Engine:**
    *   Function: Combines the fragment reassembly, obfuscation reversal, and template library to construct a complete, de-obfuscated payload for analysis.
    *   Algorithm:
        1.  Receive test packet (or captured packet).
        2.  Initiate fragment reassembly (if fragmentation headers detected).
        3.  Apply obfuscation detection and reversal algorithms.
        4.  If payload matches a known template, apply associated forensic tests.
        5.  Output reconstructed payload to forensic analysis engine.
        6.  Log all reconstruction steps and detected obfuscation techniques.

5.  **Forensic Analysis Engine Interface:**
    *   Function: Provides an interface for external forensic tools to access reconstructed payloads for detailed analysis (e.g., malware scanning, intrusion detection, data leakage prevention).
    *   Protocol:  API based communication (REST or gRPC).
    *   Data Format: Standard forensic data formats (e.g., PCAP, JSON).

6. **Adaptive Payload Generation:** 
   * Function:  Instead of solely generating test packets, the device can *mimic* detected malicious payloads or traffic patterns, injecting them back into the network in a controlled manner.
   * Implementation: Payload cloning, minor modifications (e.g., source/destination IP/port), controlled injection rate.  Requires robust access control and safeguards.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Payload Construction Engine):**

```
Function ConstructPayload(packet):
  fragmented = DetectFragmentation(packet)
  obfuscated = DetectObfuscation(packet)

  If fragmented:
    reassembled_packet = ReassembleFragments(packet)
  Else:
    reassembled_packet = packet

  If obfuscated:
    decoded_packet = DecodePayload(reassembled_packet)
  Else:
    decoded_packet = reassembled_packet

  template_match = FindTemplateMatch(decoded_packet)

  If template_match:
    # Apply forensic tests based on template
    test_results = RunForensicTests(decoded_packet, template_match)
    Return test_results, decoded_packet
  Else:
    Return decoded_packet
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-speed packet processing capabilities
*   Sufficient memory for payload buffers and template library
*   Dedicated cryptographic acceleration for decoding algorithms
*   Secure storage for sensitive templates and test results.
