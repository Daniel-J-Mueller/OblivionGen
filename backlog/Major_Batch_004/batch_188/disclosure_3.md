## Adaptive Alert Routing Based on Predicted Network State

**Concept:** Extend correlation domain functionality to *predict* network state changes and proactively route alerts to specialized processors *before* full correlation occurs. This allows for preemptive action and more efficient resource allocation.

**Specifications:**

1.  **State Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Real-time network telemetry data (bandwidth utilization, CPU load, memory usage, packet loss, etc.), historical alert data, correlation domain assignments.
    *   Function: Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) to predict potential network state changes within each correlation domain. Outputs a "state change probability" score for each domain, indicating the likelihood of an event requiring specific handling (e.g., performance degradation, security breach, capacity exhaustion).
    *   Output:  “Predicted State Vector” – a time-stamped vector containing the state change probability for each correlation domain.

2.  **Dynamic Routing Table:**
    *   Input: Predicted State Vector, pre-defined “Alert Handling Profiles” (see section 3).
    *   Function:  A lookup table that maps correlation domain IDs and state change probabilities to specific Alert Handling Profiles. Utilizes a threshold-based logic.  If a correlation domain's state change probability exceeds a pre-defined threshold for a specific event type, the corresponding Alert Handling Profile is activated.
    *   Output:  “Routing Directive” – instructions to route alerts from that correlation domain to a designated Alert Processor.

3.  **Alert Handling Profiles:**
    *   Definition:  Pre-configured sets of instructions for specific alert types and predicted network states.  Examples:
        *   **“High Load – Database”**: Route alerts to a database performance optimization processor.
        *   **“Potential DDoS – Web Server”**: Route alerts to a security mitigation processor.
        *   **“Capacity Exhaustion – Storage”**: Route alerts to a storage provisioning processor.
        *   **“Maintenance Mode - all”**: Discard or suppress alerts.
    *   Components:
        *   Alert Processor ID: The designated processor to handle the alerts.
        *   Priority Level:  Indicates the urgency of the alert.
        *   Suppression Rules:  Defines conditions under which alerts should be suppressed or ignored.
        *   Action Triggers:  Defines automated actions to be taken based on the alert (e.g., scale resources, block traffic, notify administrators).

4.  **Alert Processor Adaptation:**
    *   Alert Processors are configured to dynamically adjust their processing logic based on the Routing Directive received with each alert.  This allows them to prioritize and handle alerts more effectively.
    *   Processors maintain a "state history" to improve prediction accuracy and adapt to changing network conditions.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
// Main Alert Processing Loop

For each incoming alert:

  // 1. Extract Correlation Domain ID

  // 2. Retrieve Current State Prediction from State Prediction Module

  // 3. Lookup Routing Directive in Dynamic Routing Table (based on Correlation Domain & Prediction)

  // 4. If Routing Directive found:
  //    Route alert to designated Alert Processor
  //    Set alert priority based on Routing Directive
  //    Apply suppression rules from Routing Directive
  //    Trigger automated actions from Routing Directive
  // Else:
  //    Route alert to default Alert Processor
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced alert fatigue by prioritizing critical alerts.
*   Faster response times to network incidents.
*   Improved resource utilization by routing alerts to the appropriate processors.
*   Increased network resilience by proactively addressing potential issues.
*   Allows for predictive scaling and automated remediation.
