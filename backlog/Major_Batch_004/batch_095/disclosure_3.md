## Autonomous Vehicle Swarm Spoofing Resilience – Distributed Trust Validation

**System Overview:**

This design expands upon the concept of signal strength variance to establish a distributed trust network amongst a swarm of unmanned vehicles. Instead of relying solely on individual vehicle analysis, vehicles collaboratively validate GPS data authenticity. This significantly enhances resilience against spoofing attacks, particularly in scenarios where a single vehicle might be compromised or experience localized interference.

**Components:**

*   **GPS Receiver Array:** Each UAV is equipped with a standard GPS receiver.
*   **Signal Strength Monitor:** Software module continuously monitoring GPS signal strength, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and number of visible satellites.
*   **Historical Data Store:** Local storage on each UAV containing historical GPS signal characteristics for known locations/flight paths (built over time).
*   **Communication Module:** Short-range, secure communication link (e.g., mesh network) enabling data exchange between nearby UAVs.
*   **Trust Score Calculator:** Algorithm to compute a ‘trust score’ for incoming GPS data based on signal characteristics, historical data comparison, and peer validation.
*   **Consensus Engine:** Module to establish a consensus trust score across the swarm for shared location data.
*   **Redundancy Manager:** System to switch to alternative navigation methods (inertial navigation, visual odometry, map-matching) if consensus trust falls below a threshold.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Each UAV continuously receives GPS data and records signal characteristics.
2.  **Local Trust Calculation:** Each UAV calculates a preliminary trust score for its GPS data. This score is based on:
    *   Signal Strength Variance: Deviation from expected values based on historical data.
    *   SNR Quality: Signal-to-noise ratio analysis.
    *   Satellite Visibility: Number and distribution of visible satellites.
3.  **Peer Exchange:** UAVs exchange their preliminary trust scores and raw GPS data with nearby peers (within communication range).
4.  **Trust Score Aggregation:** Each UAV aggregates trust scores received from its peers, weighting them based on peer reliability (determined by past behavior and data consistency).
5.  **Consensus Establishment:** A consensus engine (e.g., median filter, distributed average) computes a swarm-wide trust score for the shared location data.
6.  **Trust Validation:** If the consensus trust score falls below a predefined threshold, the system flags the location data as potentially spoofed.
7.  **Redundancy Activation:** When spoofing is detected, the redundancy manager activates alternative navigation methods, potentially combining data from multiple sources (INS, cameras, maps).
8.  **Anomaly Reporting:** Suspected spoofing events are reported to a central monitoring station for further analysis.

**Pseudocode (Trust Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(currentSignalStrength, expectedSignalStrength, SNR, numSatellites):
    signalStrengthDeviation = abs(currentSignalStrength - expectedSignalStrength)
    signalStrengthScore = 1 - (signalStrengthDeviation / expectedSignalStrength)  // Higher score for less deviation
    snrScore = sigmoid(SNR)  // Sigmoid to map SNR to a 0-1 range
    satelliteScore = sigmoid(numSatellites)  // More satellites = higher score

    trustScore = (signalStrengthScore * 0.5) + (snrScore * 0.3) + (satelliteScore * 0.2)
    return trustScore

function aggregateTrustScores(localTrustScore, peerTrustScores):
    weightedSum = (localTrustScore * 0.6) // Higher weighting to local data
    for peerScore in peerTrustScores:
        weightedSum += (peerScore * 0.1) // Equal weighting to peers
    consensusTrustScore = weightedSum / (1 + len(peerTrustScores))
    return consensusTrustScore
```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Train a machine learning model to predict expected signal strength based on location, time, and environmental conditions.
*   **Blockchain-Based Trust Registry:** Utilize a blockchain to create a tamper-proof record of vehicle trust scores and detected spoofing events.
*   **Multi-Sensor Fusion:** Integrate data from other sensors (e.g., inertial measurement units, cameras, radar) to further validate location data.
*    **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Adapt trust thresholds based on environmental factors (e.g., urban canyons, areas with known interference).
