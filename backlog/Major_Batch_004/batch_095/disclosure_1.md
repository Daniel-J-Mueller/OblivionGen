## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Composition

**Concept:** Expand beyond merely *detecting* environmental information to *composing* an acoustic scene profile which dynamically alters detection thresholds and model weighting based on perceived acoustic environments. This moves beyond simple noise cancellation or feature extraction, creating a proactive, adaptive listening profile.

**Specifications:**

**1. Acoustic Scene Analyzer (ASA) Module:**

   *   **Input:** Raw audio stream (buffered segments of 1-5 seconds).
   *   **Process:**
        *   Utilize a multi-layered convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a vast dataset of acoustic scenes (home, office, car, outdoors, etc.).  The CNN will output a probability distribution across predefined scene categories.
        *   Implement a 'scene mixing' layer. Allow the CNN to output a weighted combination of scene profiles (e.g., 70% 'home', 30% 'street noise').  This addresses ambiguous or mixed environments.
        *   Generate a feature vector representing the weighted scene composition.  This is *not* a classification – it’s a continuous representation of the acoustic environment.
   *   **Output:** Scene Composition Vector (SCV) – a floating-point vector representing the weighted acoustic scene.

**2. Dynamic Detection Weighting (DDW) Module:**

   *   **Input:** SCV, Detection Scores (from existing wake word/keyword detection model).
   *   **Process:**
        *   Maintain a lookup table mapping SCV ranges to weighting factors for different acoustic features (e.g., voice frequency bands, noise floor levels).
        *   Apply weighting factors to the feature vectors *before* they are fed into the detection model.  This dynamically emphasizes or de-emphasizes certain frequencies or characteristics based on the environment.
        *   Adjust detection thresholds. Higher noise floors in the SCV will raise the threshold.  Quieter environments will lower it.
   *   **Output:** Adjusted Detection Score.

**3.  Contextual Refinement Module (CRM):**

   *   **Input:** SCV, User Activity Data (calendar events, location data, app usage), Time of Day.
   *   **Process:**
        *   Establish a correlation between SCV, user activity, and time of day. For example:
            *   “Home” + “Calendar: Meeting” → Prioritize voice clarity and lower background noise threshold.
            *   “Car” + “Phone Call” → Aggressively filter out road noise and emphasize voice frequencies.
        *   Modify the DDW weighting factors based on these correlations.
   *   **Output:** Refined DDW Weighting Factors.

**4.  Model Adaptation (Optional):**

   *   Continuously monitor detection accuracy in various SCV ranges.
   *   Use reinforcement learning to fine-tune the DDW weighting factors and thresholds over time, optimizing performance for each acoustic environment. This could happen locally on the device or in the cloud.



**Pseudocode (DDW Module):**

```
function adjust_detection_score(detection_score, scv):
  # Lookup weighting factors based on SCV
  weighting_factors = lookup_weighting_factors(scv)

  # Apply weighting factors to the input features (assumed to be available)
  weighted_features = apply_weighting(features, weighting_factors)

  # Recalculate detection score using weighted features
  adjusted_score = detection_model(weighted_features)

  return adjusted_score
```

**Key Innovation:** Moves beyond passive environmental *detection* to proactive acoustic *composition*, creating an adaptive listening profile that optimizes performance for any environment and user context. This creates a more robust and reliable wake word/keyword detection system.
