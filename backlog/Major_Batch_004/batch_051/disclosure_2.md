## Dynamic Pixel Masking with Spectral Analysis

**Concept:** Integrate a miniature spectrometer into each pixel alongside the light sensor described in the patent. Use spectral data to dynamically adjust a micro-lens array (MLA) or micro-shutter array (MSA) *within* each pixel, effectively masking portions of the incoming light based on wavelength. This allows for significantly enhanced color accuracy, contrast, and potentially, novel display modes.

**Specifications:**

*   **Pixel Architecture:** Each pixel consists of:
    *   Electrophoretic (or similar) display element.
    *   Miniature spectrometer (diffraction grating, prism, or interference filter based). Resolution: capable of discerning at least three primary color bands (Red, Green, Blue), ideally with finer granularity. Dimensions: < 50µm x 50µm x 10µm.
    *   Micro-Lens Array (MLA) or Micro-Shutter Array (MSA):  Consisting of individually addressable micro-lenses or shutters.  Resolution: Minimum 4x4 array per pixel. Actuation: MEMS-based electrostatic or magnetic control.
    *   Light Sensor (as described in provided patent) - positioned to read reflected/transmitted light *after* MLA/MSA.
    *   Thin-film transistor (TFT) backplane for individual pixel control.

*   **Operational Modes:**

    1.  **Standard Display Mode:** Spectrometer analyzes incoming light. Control algorithm determines optimal MLA/MSA configuration to maximize color accuracy and contrast for that pixel.  Light sensor provides feedback for fine-tuning.
    2.  **Spectral Filtering Mode:**  Algorithm can selectively block or transmit specific wavelengths. This could allow for:
        *   Enhanced viewing in bright sunlight (blocking UV/IR).
        *   Color correction for individuals with color blindness (wavelength shifting).
        *   Creation of custom color palettes and artistic effects.
    3.  **Ambient Light Compensation:** The spectrometer provides detailed spectral information about ambient light.  This data is used to dynamically adjust the display's output, achieving perfect white balance and contrast regardless of the surrounding environment.
    4.  **Material Identification Mode:** In conjunction with external processing, spectral data can be used to identify materials displayed on the screen (e.g., for augmented reality applications).

*   **Control Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
For each pixel:
    1. Acquire spectral data using miniature spectrometer.
    2. Analyze spectral data to determine:
        a. Dominant wavelengths present.
        b. Color temperature.
        c. Light intensity.
    3. Calculate optimal MLA/MSA configuration based on:
        a. Desired color output.
        b. Current spectral data.
        c. Calibration data for pixel and spectrometer.
    4. Send control signals to MLA/MSA actuators.
    5. Read light sensor output.
    6. Adjust MLA/MSA configuration (feedback loop) to minimize error between desired and actual color/intensity.
```

*   **Materials:**
    *   Spectrometer: Silicon-based diffraction grating or thin-film interference filters.
    *   MLA/MSA: Polymer or silicon-based microstructures.
    *   TFT Backplane: Amorphous silicon or LTPS.
*   **Power Consumption:** Target: < 5mW per pixel.  Dynamic power management techniques to minimize energy usage.
