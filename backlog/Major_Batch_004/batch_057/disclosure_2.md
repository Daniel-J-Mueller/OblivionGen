## Dynamic Social Influence Scoring & Tiered Content Access

**Concept:** Expand on the social networking integration by introducing a dynamic scoring system that assesses a user’s *influence* within their network, not just activity level. This influence score then gates access to exclusive content tiers and features within the electronic catalog.

**Specs:**

**1. Influence Metric Calculation:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Social Network API:  Gather data points beyond basic post/comment count. Include:
        *   Engagement Rate (likes, shares, comments *per follower/connection*)
        *   Network Diversity (number of distinct communities/interests represented within connections)
        *   Reciprocity (how often user interactions are returned by their connections)
        *   Sentiment Analysis of interactions (positive/negative tone of comments/replies)
    *   Electronic Catalog Data:
        *   Purchase History (frequency, value, categories)
        *   Wishlist Activity (items added, frequency)
        *   Product Review Quality (length, detail, helpfulness ratings)
        *   Referral Activity (number of successful referrals)
*   **Scoring Algorithm:**
    *   Weighted sum of data points. Weights adjustable via A/B testing.
    *   Normalization to a scale of 0-100.
    *   Decay function to prioritize recent activity.
    *   Fraud detection to filter out artificial influence (bot activity, purchased followers).

**2. Content Tier Structure:**

*   **Tier 1: (Score 0-30) – “Explorer”** – Default access. Standard product listings, basic recommendations.
*   **Tier 2: (Score 31-60) – “Connector”** – Early access to new product previews, exclusive discounts on trending items, personalized curated collections.
*   **Tier 3: (Score 61-85) – “Influencer”** – Direct collaboration opportunities (product feedback, co-creation), advanced customization options, priority customer support.
*   **Tier 4: (Score 86-100) – “Ambassador”** – Access to exclusive events, brand ambassador program eligibility, significant referral rewards.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Influence Engine:**  Dedicated microservice responsible for calculating and updating influence scores in real-time. Asynchronous data ingestion from both Social Network APIs and Electronic Catalog databases.
*   **Content Gating Module:** Intercepts user requests for content and dynamically renders appropriate content based on influence tier.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/influence/score/{userId}` – Returns current influence score.
    *   `/influence/tier/{userId}` – Returns current influence tier.
    *   `/content/gated/{contentId}` – Handles requests for gated content.

**4. Pseudocode (Content Gating Module):**

```
function getContent(userId, contentId):
  tier = getInfluenceTier(userId)
  if contentId is gated:
    if tier < requiredTierForContent(contentId):
      displayMessage = "Unlock this content by increasing your influence!"
      return displayMessage
    else:
      return renderContent(contentId, tier)
  else:
    return renderContent(contentId, tier)

function getInfluenceTier(userId):
  score = getInfluenceScore(userId)
  if score <= 30:
    return "Explorer"
  else if score <= 60:
    return "Connector"
  else if score <= 85:
    return "Influencer"
  else:
    return "Ambassador"
```

**5.  Considerations:**

*   Privacy: Obtain explicit user consent for accessing and utilizing social network data.
*   Gamification: Introduce challenges and rewards to incentivize users to increase their influence.
*   Dynamic Adjustment: Continuously refine the scoring algorithm and tier structure based on user behavior and performance.
