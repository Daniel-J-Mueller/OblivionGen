## Adaptive Quorum Based on User Behavioral Biometrics

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust quorum requirements for promotion requests based on real-time behavioral biometric analysis of approving users.  This system goes beyond static ratios and timeouts; it attempts to gauge the *confidence* in an approval, not just the *number* of approvals.

**II. Components:**

*   **Behavioral Biometrics Engine:** This module continuously collects and analyzes data from approving users during the approval process.  Data points include:
    *   **Typing Cadence:**  Speed and rhythm of keystrokes while entering approval credentials or responding to notifications.
    *   **Mouse Movement:**  Speed, acceleration, and patterns of mouse movements.  Dwell time over specific elements (e.g., the "Approve" button).
    *   **Device Orientation/Motion:** (If using mobile devices)  Changes in device angle or movement while interacting with the approval request.
    *   **Interaction Time:** Total time taken to review and approve/deny the request.
    *   **Scroll Depth & Speed:** How much of the request details the user reviewed before making a decision, and at what speed.
    *   **Authentication Method:** Whether multi-factor authentication (MFA) was utilized and, if so, which method.
*   **Confidence Scoring Model:** A machine learning model trained to assign a “confidence score” to each approval based on the behavioral biometric data.  The model uses the data above as features and assigns a score from 0-100 (higher is more confident). This score is normalized by user.
*   **Dynamic Quorum Adjustment Engine:**  This engine calculates a weighted quorum based on the aggregate confidence scores of approving users. The target quorum isn't a fixed number or percentage; it’s a dynamic "confidence threshold."
*   **Promotion Request Management System:**  Integrates with existing systems to handle promotion requests and orchestrate the approval process.

**III. Workflow:**

1.  **Promotion Request Initiated:** Candidate user requests access to target user’s security roles.
2.  **Approving User Identification:** System identifies the set of approving users as defined by the target user's promotion rules.
3.  **Approval Request Sent:**  System sends approval requests to identified users via their preferred communication channel (email, SMS, app notification).
4.  **Biometric Data Collection:** As each user interacts with the approval request, the Behavioral Biometrics Engine collects data.
5.  **Confidence Score Calculation:** The Confidence Scoring Model assigns a confidence score to each approval.
6.  **Quorum Calculation:** The Dynamic Quorum Adjustment Engine sums the confidence scores of all approvals received. A pre-defined “confidence threshold” is established. The promotion is approved *when the total confidence score exceeds the threshold*, not necessarily when a fixed number of approvals is reached.
7.  **Promotion Granted/Denied:** Access is granted or denied based on whether the confidence threshold was met.

**IV. Pseudocode (Dynamic Quorum Calculation):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateDynamicQuorum(approvals):
  totalConfidence = 0
  FOR EACH approval IN approvals:
    confidenceScore = GetConfidenceScore(approval.user, approval.biometricData)
    totalConfidence = totalConfidence + confidenceScore

  confidenceThreshold = GetConfidenceThreshold(targetUser) // Target user defined threshold

  IF totalConfidence >= confidenceThreshold THEN
    RETURN TRUE // Promotion approved
  ELSE
    RETURN FALSE // Promotion denied
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION GetConfidenceScore(user, biometricData):
    // Apply Machine Learning Model trained on biometric data
    confidenceScore = ML_Model.Predict(user, biometricData)
    RETURN confidenceScore
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION GetConfidenceThreshold(targetUser):
  // Retrieve threshold from Target User's profile/settings
  threshold = TargetUser.Profile.ConfidenceThreshold
  RETURN threshold
ENDFUNCTION
```

**V.  Additional Considerations:**

*   **Adaptive Learning:** The Machine Learning model should be continuously retrained with new data to improve accuracy.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Flag potentially fraudulent approvals based on significant deviations in biometric data.
*   **Privacy:** Anonymize and aggregate biometric data to protect user privacy.  Obtain explicit consent for data collection.
*   **Baseline Establishment:**  Establish a baseline biometric profile for each user to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication Integration**: Increase the weight of approvals received after successful MFA.
