## Dynamic Tag-Based Workflow Automation

**Concept:** Extend the visualized tagging system to *trigger* automated workflows based on tag combinations and/or real-time event streams associated with tagged elements. Instead of purely visualization, tags become action initiators.

**Specifications:**

**1. Workflow Definition Interface:**

*   **Data Structure:** A JSON-based workflow definition language.  Example:

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "WF001",
  "trigger": {
    "tag_combination": {
      "required_tags": ["critical_error", "user_reported"],
      "optional_tags": ["high_priority"]
    },
    "event_type": "element_interaction" //e.g. 'element_interaction', 'page_load', 'timer'
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "api_call",
      "endpoint": "/alert_ops_team",
      "payload": {
        "error_message": "Critical user-reported error detected.",
        "element_id": "{{element_id}}", //Dynamic variable
        "timestamp": "{{timestamp}}"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "ui_modification",
      "target": "{{element_id}}",
      "style_override": {
        "background_color": "red",
        "font_weight": "bold"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

*   **UI Component:** A drag-and-drop workflow editor integrated within the tag viewer interface.  Users can visually define triggers (tag combinations, event streams) and associated actions (API calls, UI modifications, data exports).
*   **Workflow Repository:** A central database storing defined workflows, accessible via API.

**2. Real-Time Event Stream Integration:**

*   **Event Capture:** Integrate with the existing event stream (customer interactions). Capture events related to tagged elements (clicks, hovers, form submissions).
*   **Event Filtering:** Filter events based on associated tags and workflow triggers.
*   **Workflow Activation:** Activate workflows when matching events are detected.

**3. Dynamic Variable Substitution:**

*   **Variable Definitions:** Support dynamic variable substitution within API payloads and UI modification rules. Example variables: `{{element_id}}`, `{{tag_value}}`, `{{timestamp}}`, `{{user_id}}`.
*   **Variable Resolution:** Resolve variables at runtime based on the triggering event and associated tagged element.

**4. Workflow Management & Monitoring:**

*   **Workflow Status:** Track the status of running workflows (success, failure, pending).
*   **Workflow Logs:** Generate detailed logs for each workflow execution, including input parameters, execution steps, and output results.
*   **Workflow Scheduling:**  Allow workflows to be scheduled to run at specific times or intervals.

**5. Tag-Based A/B Testing:**

*   **Tag Assignment:** Assign tags to variations of web page elements.
*   **Workflow Triggering:** Trigger workflows to track user interactions with different tagged variations.
*   **Performance Reporting:** Generate reports comparing the performance of different variations based on captured interaction data.

**Pseudocode for Workflow Execution Engine:**

```
function executeWorkflow(workflow, event) {
  if (matchesTrigger(workflow.trigger, event)) {
    for each action in workflow.actions {
      try {
        executeAction(action, event);
      } catch (error) {
        logError("Action execution failed:", error);
      }
    }
  }
}

function matchesTrigger(trigger, event) {
  if (trigger.tag_combination) {
    //Check if event is associated with required tags & optional tags
  }
  if (trigger.event_type != null && trigger.event_type != event.type) {
      return false;
  }

  return true;
}

function executeAction(action, event) {
    //API call, UI modification, etc
}
```
