## Multi-Modal Contact Resolution & Predictive Dialing

**Concept:** Expand contact resolution beyond voice to incorporate visual and contextual data, coupled with a predictive dialing system that anticipates communication needs *before* explicit invocation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Fusion Module:**

*   **Input Sources:**
    *   Audio Input (as per existing patent)
    *   Camera Input: Real-time video feed from the device.
    *   Location Data: GPS, Wi-Fi positioning.
    *   Calendar/Scheduling Data: Access to user’s calendar.
    *   Application Usage Data: Tracking frequently used communication apps.
    *   Environmental Sensors: Ambient noise, light levels, movement.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Object Recognition (Camera): Identify people, places, objects in the video feed.
    *   Facial Recognition: Identify individuals present in the video.
    *   Location Context: Determine current location (home, work, gym, etc.).
    *   Calendar/App Event Analysis: Identify upcoming meetings, appointments, or communication patterns.
    *   Sensor Data Analysis: Infer user activity (e.g., driving, exercising).
*   **Output:** Consolidated contextual data representing the user’s current environment and likely intent.

**2. Predictive Contact Resolver Module:**

*   **Input:** Contextual data from Data Acquisition & Fusion Module, Contact List.
*   **Logic:**
    *   **Probabilistic Modeling:** Assign probabilities to contacts based on contextual data.
        *   *Example:* If user is at the gym and frequently contacts "Personal Trainer" at this location, assign a high probability to "Personal Trainer."
        *   *Example:* If a calendar event indicates a meeting with "John Doe" in 30 minutes, assign a high probability to "John Doe."
        *   *Example:* If driving and frequently calls "Mom" during commute, assign a high probability to "Mom."
    *   **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Combine voice recognition (from existing patent) with contextual probabilities.
        *   *Weighted Scoring:* Assign weights to voice match score and contextual probability score.
    *   **Thresholding:**  If the weighted score exceeds a predefined threshold, proactively suggest the contact to the user *before* explicit invocation.

**3. Proactive Communication Interface:**

*   **Visual Display:**  Display a small, unobtrusive “bubble” on the screen suggesting the most probable contact.
*   **Audio Prompt:** (Optional)  A subtle audio prompt like, “Calling [Contact Name]?”
*   **Confirmation/Dismissal:**  User can:
    *   Tap the bubble to initiate the call.
    *   Swipe to dismiss the suggestion.
    *   Voice command (“No,” “Not now,” etc.).

**4. Learning & Adaptation Module:**

*   **Feedback Loop:** Track user interactions (confirmation, dismissal, corrections) to refine the probabilistic model.
*   **Personalized Profiles:** Create personalized profiles for each user, capturing their communication patterns and preferences.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Automatically adjust the threshold for proactive suggestions based on user behavior.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Contact Resolver Module):**

```
function resolveContact(audioData, contextualData, contactList) {
  voiceMatchScore = performVoiceRecognition(audioData, contactList);
  contextualProbability = calculateContextualProbability(contextualData, contactList);

  // Weighted scoring (adjust weights as needed)
  weightedScore = (0.6 * voiceMatchScore) + (0.4 * contextualProbability);

  if (weightedScore > threshold) {
    suggestContact(contact); // Display suggestion on screen
  } else {
    // Fallback to existing patent's contact resolution process
    performStandardContactResolution(audioData, contactList);
  }
}

function calculateContextualProbability(contextualData, contactList) {
    // Implement logic to assign probabilities based on context
    // (location, calendar events, app usage, etc.)
    // Return a map of contact names to probabilities
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Device with camera, GPS, and microphone.
*   Sufficient processing power for real-time object recognition and data analysis.
*   Secure storage for user data and personalized profiles.
