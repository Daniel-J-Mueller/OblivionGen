## Dynamic Metric Synthesis via Generative Models

**Specification:** A system to proactively *generate* potentially useful metrics, rather than solely reporting those explicitly defined. This builds on the existing framework of declarative metric specification but extends it to include a generative component.

**Core Concept:**  Employ a generative model (e.g., Variational Autoencoder, Generative Adversarial Network) trained on historical metric data. This model learns the underlying relationships between existing metrics and can then synthesize *new* metric candidates.  These candidates are evaluated for potential usefulness *before* being reported.

**Components:**

1.  **Metric Data Store:** Historical time-series data for all existing metrics, alongside associated metadata (units, description, data type).
2.  **Generative Model:**  A trained model capable of generating new time-series data resembling existing metrics.  Architecture choice dependent on data complexity, but LSTM-based VAE or GAN preferred.  Model is retrained periodically to adapt to changing system behavior.
3.  **Metric Candidate Generator:**  This component queries the Generative Model to produce a set of potential new metrics (time-series data).  It also generates associated metadata, possibly using another model trained to predict metadata from time-series characteristics.
4.  **Usefulness Evaluator:** A scoring function that assesses the potential value of each candidate metric.  This is *crucial*.  Evaluation criteria:
    *   **Novelty:** How different is the candidate from existing metrics? (e.g., using a distance metric in feature space)
    *   **Correlation:** Does the candidate correlate with existing, known-problematic metrics? (Suggests potential predictive power)
    *   **Anomaly Detection Potential:** How easily can anomalies be detected within the candidate’s data stream?  (High volatility = potentially useful signal)
    *   **Predictive Power:** Can the candidate be used to predict the values of other metrics (even with a simple regression model)?
5.  **Declarative Integration:** The *new* metrics are added to the declarative specification alongside existing ones, allowing standard reporting/monitoring tools to consume them. A "confidence score" from the Usefulness Evaluator is also included in the specification.
6. **Feedback Loop:** Report on the synthesized metrics, and then re-train the generative models with this new data to improve the quality of synthesized metrics.

**Pseudocode (Metric Candidate Generation):**

```
function generate_candidate_metrics(historical_data, model):
    candidate_count = 10  # Number of metrics to generate
    candidates = []

    for i in range(candidate_count):
        new_metric_data = model.generate_sample() # Get a time-series from the model
        metadata = predict_metadata(new_metric_data) #Predict the metadata
        candidates.append((new_metric_data, metadata))

    return candidates
```

**Pseudocode (Usefulness Evaluator – simplified):**

```
function evaluate_usefulness(metric_data, existing_metrics):
    novelty_score = calculate_novelty(metric_data, existing_metrics)
    correlation_score = calculate_correlation(metric_data, problematic_metrics)
    anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_potential(metric_data)

    # Weighted sum (weights need tuning)
    usefulness_score = 0.4 * novelty_score + 0.3 * correlation_score + 0.3 * anomaly_score
    return usefulness_score
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Proactive identification of potential problems before they manifest as failures.
*   Discovery of hidden relationships within the system.
*   Reduced reliance on manual metric definition.
*   Adaptation to evolving system behavior.
