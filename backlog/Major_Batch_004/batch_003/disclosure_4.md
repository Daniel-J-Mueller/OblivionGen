## Predictive Resource Adaptation Based on User Gaze

**Concept:** Extend pre-fetching not just on *predicted* next pages, but on *predicted* areas of the *current* page based on user gaze tracking. Dynamically adjust resource quality and retrieval priority *within* a page as the user’s gaze shifts.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Gaze Tracking Integration:**
    *   Hardware: Integrate with existing gaze tracking hardware (e.g., Tobii, SMI) or utilize camera-based gaze estimation.
    *   Software: Develop a gaze tracking SDK that provides real-time gaze point data (x, y coordinates on the screen) and confidence metrics.

2.  **Heatmap Generation:**
    *   Algorithm: Implement a dynamic heatmap generation algorithm that accumulates gaze data over time.
    *   Resolution: Generate heatmaps at multiple resolutions: low-res for broad area prediction, high-res for precise object/region prediction.
    *   Temporal Decay: Incorporate temporal decay to prioritize recent gaze data.  Older gaze data contributes less to the heatmap.

3.  **Resource Prioritization:**
    *   Resource Mapping: Develop a mechanism to map screen regions to corresponding resources (images, videos, text blocks, etc.). This could involve DOM analysis and bounding box calculations.
    *   Priority Score: Calculate a priority score for each resource based on:
        *   Heatmap Intensity: Higher heatmap intensity within the resource’s bounding box = higher priority.
        *   Resource Type: Certain resource types (e.g., high-resolution images, videos) may have higher initial priority.
        *   Distance from Gaze: Resources closer to the current gaze point receive a priority boost.
    *   Dynamic List Generation: Maintain a prioritized list of resources to be fetched/optimized based on the priority scores.

4.  **Resource Adaptation:**
    *   Quality Switching: Implement a system to switch between different quality levels (resolution, compression) for images and videos based on their priority.
    *   Lazy Loading/Unloading: Prioritize loading high-quality resources for areas the user is currently looking at and unload/lower quality of resources in areas the user is not.
    *   Progressive Rendering: For complex resources (e.g., 3D models), prioritize rendering visible portions first.

5.  **Bandwidth Awareness:**
    *   Network Monitoring: Monitor available bandwidth and adjust resource quality/loading rate accordingly.
    *   Adaptive Algorithm: Dynamically adjust the prioritization algorithm based on network conditions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (userIsBrowsing) {
  gazePoint = getGazePoint();
  heatmap = updateHeatmap(gazePoint);
  resourceList = getVisibleResources();

  for (resource in resourceList) {
    priorityScore = calculatePriorityScore(resource, heatmap, gazePoint);
    resource.priority = priorityScore;
  }

  resourceList.sort(by: priority); // Sort by priority score

  // Fetch/Optimize Resources
  for (resource in resourceList) {
    if (resource.isLowPriority && bandwidthIsLimited) {
      unloadResource(resource);
    } else if (resource.isHighPriority) {
      loadHighQualityResource(resource);
    }
  }
}
```

**Hardware/Software Dependencies:**

*   Gaze tracking hardware/SDK
*   Browser extension or integration with rendering engine
*   Network monitoring tools

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency and improved perceived performance
*   Optimized bandwidth usage
*   Enhanced user experience through anticipatory resource loading
*   Adaptable to different network conditions and user behavior
