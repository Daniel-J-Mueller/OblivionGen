## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Layer

**Concept:** Integrate localized haptic feedback directly into the augmented video stream, synchronized with visual elements, extending beyond simple vibrations to create textural and pressure sensations on a user-worn haptic suit or glove.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Haptic Data Encoding:** Augment video data streams with metadata detailing localized haptic stimuli. This metadata includes:
    *   `x, y` coordinates (relative to the video frame) defining the point of haptic application.
    *   `intensity` (0-100) defining the strength of the haptic feedback.
    *   `texture_id` referencing a pre-defined texture profile (e.g., rough, smooth, granular).
    *   `duration` (milliseconds) defining the length of the haptic event.
    *   `pressure` (optional - PSI) defining a pressure sensation.

2.  **Haptic Rendering Engine:** A software component responsible for translating haptic metadata into control signals for a haptic device. This engine will:
    *   Receive augmented video streams and extract haptic metadata.
    *   Map `x, y` coordinates to specific haptic actuators on the userâ€™s haptic device.
    *   Control actuator intensity, texture, and pressure based on the received data.
    *   Employ spatial averaging of multiple actuators to create seamless haptic effects.

3.  **Haptic Device Integration:** Design a lightweight, full-body haptic suit or glove with a dense array of micro-actuators capable of generating localized pressure, texture, and vibration. Key features:
    *   Modular actuator design for easy replacement and customization.
    *   Wireless communication protocol (low latency, high bandwidth).
    *   Integrated sensors for tracking user movement and gesture.
    *   Biocompatible materials for comfortable long-term wear.

4. **Dynamic Texture Synthesis:** Develop algorithms to procedurally generate complex haptic textures based on visual input. For example:
    *   If the video stream shows a wooden surface, the system should synthesize a grainy texture on the corresponding area of the haptic suit.
    *   If the video stream shows water flowing, the system should simulate a wet, smooth sensation.
    *   Implement machine learning models trained on haptic texture datasets to improve the realism and accuracy of the synthesized textures.

5. **Interactive Haptic Control:** Allow users to manipulate haptic feedback directly.
    *  Implement gesture-based controls to adjust haptic intensity, texture, and spatial mapping.
    *   Develop a voice-command interface for controlling haptic parameters.
    *   Allow users to create and save custom haptic profiles for different environments and experiences.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Rendering Engine):**

```
function processFrame(videoFrame, hapticData) {
  for each hapticEvent in hapticData {
    x = hapticEvent.x
    y = hapticEvent.y
    intensity = hapticEvent.intensity
    textureId = hapticEvent.textureId
    duration = hapticEvent.duration

    // Map x,y coordinates to actuator location
    actuatorLocation = mapCoordinates(x, y)

    // Select actuator texture profile
    textureProfile = getTextureProfile(textureId)

    // Activate actuator with specified intensity, texture, and duration
    activateActuator(actuatorLocation, intensity, textureProfile, duration)
  }
}

function mapCoordinates(x, y) {
  // Calculate actuator location based on screen coordinates
  // Implement calibration and distortion correction
  return actuatorLocation
}

function getTextureProfile(textureId) {
  // Retrieve texture profile from database
  return textureProfile
}

function activateActuator(location, intensity, profile, duration) {
  // Send control signals to haptic device
  // Control actuator intensity, texture, and duration
}
