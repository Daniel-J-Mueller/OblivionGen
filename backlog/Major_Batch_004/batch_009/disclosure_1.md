## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Multi-Device Orchestration

**Concept:** Extend the device selection logic to incorporate localized haptic feedback, creating a more intuitive and immersive user experience. The system learns user preferences for output device selection based on contextual haptic cues delivered *from* those devices.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Component Integration:** Each potential output device (speakers, displays, etc.) must integrate a small, addressable haptic actuator. This actuator can produce a range of localized vibrations, pulses, and textures.
*   **Contextual Haptic Profiles:** The system maintains a database of “haptic profiles” associated with different intents and content types (e.g., music playback, video call, navigation instructions). Each profile defines a specific haptic pattern for each potential output device.
*   **Learning Algorithm:** Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm. When the system presents a choice of output devices, it delivers a subtle haptic cue from each candidate device. The user’s implicit selection (e.g., speaking to a device, looking at a screen) is registered as positive feedback. Repeated selections strengthen the association between the intent, content type, device, and haptic pattern.
*   **Adaptive Intensity:** The intensity of the haptic cues should be dynamically adjusted based on ambient noise levels and user proximity to the device.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to define their own custom haptic profiles for specific intents and content types.
*   **Multi-User Profiles:** Support multiple user profiles, enabling personalized haptic experiences for different individuals.
*   **Priority Override:** Implement a priority override mechanism. For example, emergency alerts should trigger a strong, distinct haptic signal on the nearest available device, regardless of user preferences.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
// Function: Determine Output Device with Haptic Feedback
function determineOutputDevice(intentData, contentData, location) {

    // 1. Get list of candidate devices at location
    candidateDevices = getDevicesAtLocation(location)

    // 2. Filter devices based on capability (audio, video)
    capableDevices = filterDevicesByCapability(candidateDevices, contentData)

    // 3. If only one capable device, return it
    if (capableDevices.length == 1) {
        return capableDevices[0]
    }

    // 4. Load haptic profiles for intent and content
    hapticProfiles = loadHapticProfiles(intentData, contentData)

    // 5.  Deliver haptic cues from each capable device (subtle pulse/vibration)
    for (device in capableDevices) {
        deliverHapticCue(device, hapticProfiles[device].cue) //cue is pre-defined profile
    }

    // 6. Monitor user interaction (speech, gaze, touch) for selection
    selectedDevice = monitorUserInteraction(capableDevices)

    // 7.  Update learning algorithm with user selection
    updateLearningAlgorithm(intentData, contentData, selectedDevice)

    return selectedDevice
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Smart Home Control:**  When issuing a voice command, the system could subtly vibrate the smart speaker most likely to respond.
*   **Hands-Free Navigation:**  A gentle vibration on a car's dashboard could indicate the optimal turn direction.
*   **Immersive Gaming:** Haptic feedback on different devices could enhance the gaming experience (e.g., a vibration on a controller, a pulse from a nearby speaker).
*   **Accessibility:** Provide alternative sensory cues for visually impaired users.
