## Adaptive Message Prioritization & Speculative Buffering

**Concept:** Extend the shared memory messaging system with dynamic message prioritization *and* a predictive buffering mechanism. The current patent focuses on ordered delivery. This builds on that by allowing higher-priority messages to ‘jump the queue’ while simultaneously pre-fetching likely-needed messages to reduce latency.

**Specs:**

*   **Priority Encoding:** Each message header will include a priority field (8-bit integer).  Higher values indicate higher priority.
*   **Priority Queue within Shared Memory:** The shared circular buffer will be conceptually divided into priority levels (e.g., 4 levels – Low, Medium, High, Critical).  Messages are written to the buffer *based on priority*, not necessarily strict sequential order.
*   **Read-Side Prioritization:** The receiving process will maintain a priority queue of messages to read.  The queue is populated by scanning the shared buffer. Higher priority messages are read *first*, potentially interrupting the sequential read.
*   **Speculative Buffering (Prediction Engine):**  Implement a prediction engine on the receiving side. This engine analyzes the sequence of incoming messages (message type, frequency, patterns) to *predict* which messages will be needed next. Predicted messages are pre-fetched into a separate, smaller, local buffer on the receiving process.
*   **Local Buffer & Coalescing:** The local buffer is a smaller, faster cache. When a predicted message is requested, it’s retrieved from the local buffer.  The prediction engine attempts to coalesce multiple predicted messages into a single read from shared memory to improve efficiency.
*   **Write-Side Hints:** The sending process can optionally include “hint” flags in the message header, indicating whether a message is likely to trigger a request for further messages (e.g., a “request for data” message).  This provides the sending process with information to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Buffer Management:** A dedicated thread manages the buffer (shared and local).  The thread is responsible for allocating/deallocating buffers, handling buffer overflows, and ensuring data consistency.
*   **Flow Control:** Implement a simple flow control mechanism to prevent the sending process from overwhelming the receiving process. This could involve a “watermark” system where the sending process pauses sending messages if the shared buffer reaches a certain fill level.

**Pseudocode (Receiving Process – Core Logic):**

```
// Initialization
sharedMemoryBuffer = // Pointer to shared memory circular buffer
localBuffer = // Local cache buffer
priorityQueue = // Priority queue to hold message IDs

while (true) {
  // 1. Scan Shared Memory (with priority awareness)
  for (priorityLevel = Critical to Low) {
    for (message in sharedMemoryBuffer at priorityLevel) {
      if (message.header.readFlag == false && message.priority > currentHighestPriority){
        priorityQueue.add(message.id, message.priority)
      }
    }
  }
  
  // 2. Process Priority Queue (Highest Priority First)
  if (priorityQueue.isEmpty() == false){
    messageId = priorityQueue.peek()
    message = getMessageFromSharedMemory(messageId)
    
    // Check Local Buffer First
    if (localBuffer.contains(messageId)){
      //Retrieve from local buffer
    } else {
      //Read from shared memory
      readMessageFromSharedMemory(message)
      localBuffer.add(message) // Add to local buffer for future access
    }
    
    //Process message
    processMessage(message)
    
    priorityQueue.remove(messageId)
  }
  // 3. Prediction Engine (runs periodically)
  predictionEngine.predictNextMessages()
  for (predictedMessageId in predictionEngine.predictedMessages) {
    if (sharedMemoryBuffer.contains(predictedMessageId) == false) {
      // Request message from sending process (or pre-fetch if possible)
    }
  }

}
