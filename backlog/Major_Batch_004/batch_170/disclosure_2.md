## Dynamic Key Sharding & Temporal Access Control

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of embedding cryptographic keys within URLs to create a system where a key isn't *fully* present in any single URL, but rather *sharded* across multiple, sequentially accessed URLs.  Combine this with a time-limited validity window *per shard*, making unauthorized access exponentially more difficult.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Sharding Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** A master cryptographic key (e.g., 256-bit AES).
*   **Process:** Divide the master key into *n* equal-sized shards. (e.g., a 256-bit key into 4 x 64-bit shards).
*   **Output:** *n* key shards.

**2. URL Generation Protocol:**

*   **Base URL Structure:** `https://service.example.com/request?op={operation}&shard={shard_number}&timestamp={timestamp}&signature={signature}`
*   `{operation}`: Specifies the operation to be performed.
*   `{shard_number}`:  Indicates which key shard is being requested (1 to *n*).
*   `{timestamp}`:  UTC timestamp of the request (milliseconds).
*   `{signature}`:  HMAC-SHA256 signature of `operation`, `shard_number`, `timestamp`, generated using a pre-shared secret key *known only to the key shard generator*. This verifies the request hasn’t been tampered with.

**3. Key Shard Service:**

*   **Input:** URL parameters (operation, shard_number, timestamp, signature).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Verify the `signature`. If invalid, reject the request.
    2.  If `shard_number` is within the valid range (1 to *n*), retrieve the corresponding key shard.
    3.  Apply Temporal Access Control (see section 4).
    4.  Return the key shard (encrypted with a public key associated with the requesting entity, if desired).
*   **Output:** Key shard or error message.

**4. Temporal Access Control:**

*   Each key shard has an associated validity window (start time, end time).
*   The Key Shard Service checks if the request `timestamp` falls within the validity window of the requested shard.
*   Validity windows are staggered (e.g., shard 1 valid from t=0 to t=10s, shard 2 valid from t=2s to t=12s, etc.).  This creates a ‘sliding window’ of access.
*   If the `timestamp` is outside the validity window, the request is rejected.

**5. Operation Execution:**

*   The requesting entity must collect *all n* key shards *within their respective validity windows*.
*   Once all shards are collected, they can be combined to reconstruct the master cryptographic key.
*   The operation can then be performed using the reconstructed key.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function requestKeyShard(operation, shardNumber):
  timestamp = getCurrentTimestamp()
  signature = generateHMAC(operation + shardNumber + timestamp, preSharedSecret)
  url = "https://service.example.com/request?op=" + operation + "&shard=" + shardNumber + "&timestamp=" + timestamp + "&signature=" + signature
  response = makeHttpRequest(url)
  if (response.status == 200):
    return response.data // Key shard
  else:
    return null // Error

function collectKeyShards(operation, numShards):
  shards = []
  for i in range(1, numShards + 1):
    shard = requestKeyShard(operation, i)
    if (shard == null):
      return null // Failed to collect shard
    shards.append(shard)
  return shards

function reconstructKey(shards):
  // Combine shards to reconstruct the master key
  return reconstructedKey

function performOperation(reconstructedKey, data):
  // Perform the operation using the reconstructed key and data
  return result
```

**Scalability & Security Considerations:**

*   Increase *n* (number of shards) to enhance security.
*   Implement rate limiting on key shard requests.
*   Regularly rotate the pre-shared secret key.
*   Consider using a key derivation function (KDF) to derive shard keys from a master secret, increasing resistance to compromise.
*   The staggered validity windows force a time constraint, preventing replay attacks and limiting the window of opportunity for attackers.
