## Dynamic Density Core Insertion

**Concept:** Expand upon the controlled foam density concept to create a multi-density core within the shipping package. Instead of solely controlling top/bottom thickness, introduce *variable* density foam injection across multiple axes during the expansion process, creating a tailored impact absorption profile.

**Specs:**

*   **Injection System:** Utilize an array of independently controlled injector nozzles (minimum 32, scalable based on product size). Each nozzle controls both foam flow rate *and* foam composition (density modifiers added *in-line*).
*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate a real-time impact mapping system. This system uses accelerometers and strain gauges embedded within the mold forms to detect potential stress points during simulated handling (robotic arm ‘drops’ and ‘shakes’).
*   **Control Algorithm:** Develop a predictive algorithm (likely a form of Reinforcement Learning) that correlates impact data with foam density/composition.  The algorithm’s objective is to minimize peak stress at any point on the product during simulated handling.
*   **Foam Composition:**  Explore the use of multiple foam types with different densities and viscoelastic properties. Include options for closed-cell foams for moisture resistance and open-cell foams for vibration damping.
*   **Mold Form Design:** Modular mold forms composed of individually addressable pins.  These pins can dynamically adjust their position to create localized voids or constrictions, directing foam flow.
*   **Injection Sequencing:** The system will initiate foam injection in layers, starting with a low-density base layer, then building up higher-density zones where impact data indicates the need for increased protection.
*   **Real-Time Adjustment:**  During the injection process, the sensor suite continuously monitors the impact response. The control algorithm adjusts foam flow rates and compositions *in real-time* to refine the protection profile.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
Initialize Sensor Suite
Initialize Foam Composition Database
Initialize Mold Form Pin Positions
Define Product Dimensions & Weight
Define Desired Impact Tolerance

//Impact Mapping Simulation
Run Impact Simulation (Robotic Arm)
Capture Sensor Data (Acceleration, Strain)
Identify Peak Stress Points

//Density Core Creation
For each point on product surface:
    If stress exceeds tolerance:
        Determine required density for that location
        Select appropriate foam composition
        Activate corresponding injector nozzles
        Adjust flow rate based on desired density
        Inject foam

//Real-time Adjustment Loop
While foam is expanding:
    Run Impact Simulation (continuous)
    Capture Sensor Data
    Analyze Data for Stress Concentrations
    If stress exceeds tolerance:
        Adjust injector nozzle flow rates in real-time
        Modify foam composition (add density modifiers)

//Post-Expansion Validation
Run Final Impact Simulation
Verify Stress Levels are Within Tolerance
