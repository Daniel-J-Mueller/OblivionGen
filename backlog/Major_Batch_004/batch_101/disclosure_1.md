## Adaptive Probe Shaping & Predictive Fault Isolation

**System Overview:**

This design introduces a system to dynamically alter probe characteristics (packet size, frequency, protocol) *based on real-time network conditions and historical agent behavior*, and leverage those changes to *predict* potential faulty agents *before* they significantly impact monitoring data.  It shifts from reactive filtering (like the patent) to proactive, adaptive monitoring.

**Components:**

*   **Probe Shaper:** A module responsible for dynamically constructing probes.  It maintains a library of probe 'templates' with configurable attributes (size, TTL, protocol â€“ ICMP, TCP SYN, UDP, etc.).
*   **Condition Monitor:**  Collects real-time network metrics (bandwidth utilization, packet loss rate, latency variations) from network devices (routers, switches).
*   **Agent Behavior Historian:**  Maintains a time-series database of each agent's probe response characteristics (latency, packet loss, response size), identifying typical behavior patterns.  It incorporates a statistical model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model) for each agent to predict future responses.
*   **Predictive Fault Isolation Engine:** This is the core of the system.  It receives data from the Condition Monitor and Agent Behavior Historian. It uses this to determine *how* to alter probe characteristics for each agent. It also predicts potential agent faults *before* they manifest as anomalous data.
*   **Central Controller:**  Orchestrates the entire system, managing probe shaping, data collection, and fault isolation.



**Pseudocode (Predictive Fault Isolation Engine):**

```pseudocode
// Inputs:
//  currentNetworkConditions:  Real-time network metrics (bandwidth, loss, latency)
//  agentBehaviorHistory:  Time-series data of agent responses
//  probeTemplates:  Library of configurable probe templates

function predictAndAdapt(currentNetworkConditions, agentBehaviorHistory, probeTemplates) {

  for each agent in monitoredAgents {

    // 1. Predict Expected Response
    predictedResponse = agentBehaviorHistory.predictNextResponse(agent)

    // 2. Assess Discrepancy (Early Warning)
    discrepancyScore = calculateDiscrepancy(currentNetworkConditions, predictedResponse)

    // 3. Adaptive Probe Selection
    if discrepancyScore > threshold {
      // Agent exhibiting unusual behavior.  Alter probe characteristics.

      // Determine appropriate probe alteration strategy based on discrepancy type:

      if discrepancy is latency related {
        // Increase probe frequency for more granular latency measurements.
        selectedProbe = selectProbe(probeTemplates, frequency=high)
      } else if discrepancy is packet loss related {
        // Reduce probe size to minimize loss.  Switch to a more robust protocol (TCP SYN).
        selectedProbe = selectProbe(probeTemplates, size=small, protocol=TCP_SYN)
      } else {
        // Use a 'stress test' probe (large size, high frequency) to quickly assess agent health
        selectedProbe = selectProbe(probeTemplates, size=large, frequency=high)
      }
    } else {
      // Agent behaving normally.  Use default probe.
      selectedProbe = defaultProbe
    }

    // 4.  Send Probe
    sendProbe(agent, selectedProbe)
  }
}

function calculateDiscrepancy(currentNetworkConditions, predictedResponse) {
  //  Compare predicted response characteristics (latency, packet loss) with current network conditions.
  //  Higher discrepancy score indicates greater deviation from expected behavior.
  //  (Implementation details depend on specific metrics and statistical models used.)
  return someMetricThatEncapsulatesTheDifference
}
```

**Novelty & Differentiation:**

*   **Proactive, not Reactive:**  Unlike the patent, this system *anticipates* agent failures before they corrupt monitoring data.
*   **Adaptive Probes:** Dynamically adjusting probe characteristics based on real-time conditions and agent history.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Uses statistical models to forecast agent behavior and identify anomalies *before* they occur.
*   **Granular Control:** Ability to tailor probe characteristics to individual agents, optimizing monitoring accuracy.
*   **Resilience:** The system will continue to function even if some agents are compromised, as the remaining agents will provide accurate monitoring data.
