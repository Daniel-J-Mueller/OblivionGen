## Dynamic Form Generation via Procedural Content Generation

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic form concept with procedural content generation (PCG) techniques to create forms tailored to individual user profiles *and* predicted needs, minimizing initial form length and maximizing data capture efficiency.  Rather than simply expanding/collapsing sections, the form *generates* relevant fields based on a user's inferred context and likelihood of requiring them.

**Specs:**

**1. User Profiling & Contextual Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** User data (explicitly provided & implicitly inferred – browsing history, past form submissions, connected accounts, location, time of day).
*   **Process:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., Bayesian Network, Markov Model, or Neural Network) to construct a probabilistic user profile.  This profile estimates the likelihood of a user needing specific data fields.  Contextual factors (current task, location, time) modulate these probabilities.
*   **Output:** A weighted list of potential form fields, ordered by predicted relevance.

**2. Procedural Form Generation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Weighted list of potential fields (from Module 1), pre-defined field templates (including input type, validation rules, and help text).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Initial Seed:** Generate a minimal form with the *highest* weighted fields (e.g., top 3-5).
    *   **Iterative Expansion:**  Based on user input in the initial seed, *and* continued monitoring of contextual factors, the engine dynamically generates additional fields. This is done in a layered fashion:
        *   **Layer 1:** Direct dependencies. If a user enters "Yes" to a question about having a pet, automatically generate fields for pet type, breed, and age.
        *   **Layer 2:** Probabilistic suggestions.  Based on the user’s profile, suggest fields with a high probability of relevance (e.g., for a frequent traveler, suggest airline loyalty program number).  These fields are displayed as "optional" with a clear explanation of their benefit.
        *   **Layer 3:** Adaptive complexity. If the user consistently provides detailed responses, gradually increase the complexity of the form by adding more specialized fields. If the user provides minimal responses, keep the form concise.
*   **Output:** A dynamically generated HTML form, tailored to the individual user.

**3. User Interface (UI) Considerations:**

*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Fields are revealed gradually, rather than overwhelming the user with a long form.
*   **Contextual Help:**  Provide clear explanations of *why* a particular field is being requested.
*   **"Smart Defaults":** Populate fields with pre-filled values whenever possible (e.g., based on location or past submissions).
*   **User Control:** Allow the user to explicitly request additional fields or dismiss suggested fields.
*   **Visual Feedback:**  Visually indicate which fields are required, optional, or suggested.

**Pseudocode (Form Generation Engine):**

```
function generateForm(userProfile, context):
  initialFields = topN(userProfile.potentialFields, 5) // Get top 5 most relevant fields
  form = createForm(initialFields)

  while (user is interacting with form):
    userInput = getUserInput()
    if (userInput is not null):
      dependencies = getDependencies(userInput)
      addFields(form, dependencies)

      suggestions = getSuggestions(userProfile, context, form)
      displaySuggestions(suggestions)

      if (user selects suggestion):
        addFields(form, suggestion)
```

**Technology Stack:**

*   **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django), Machine Learning Libraries (TensorFlow/PyTorch/Scikit-learn)
*   **Frontend:** JavaScript (React/Angular/Vue), HTML, CSS
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL/MongoDB (to store user profiles and form templates)

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply expanding/collapsing sections. It actively *generates* the form content based on a probabilistic model of user needs and context, creating a truly personalized and adaptive experience.  It anticipates what the user might need *before* they even realize it, minimizing friction and maximizing data capture.
