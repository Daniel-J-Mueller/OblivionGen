## Dynamic Credential Drift for Ephemeral Environments

**Concept:** Extending the single-use credential concept by introducing controlled ‘credential drift’ – intentional, minor alterations to credentials over the lifespan of a single execution, even *within* that single request/session. This is designed to further mitigate timing attacks and make credential replay functionally impossible, even if an attacker manages to observe credential data in transit.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Drift Engine:** A module within the on-demand execution system responsible for modifying credentials.
*   **Drift Profile:** A configuration defining the type and rate of credential drift.  This is generated dynamically *per request* based on a random seed and potentially user/resource risk profiles.
*   **Credential Mutation Functions:**  A library of functions to alter credential data. Examples: bit flipping, byte swapping, additive noise injection, minor encryption key rotation (within a larger key hierarchy), temporary addition/removal of flags.
*   **Verification Oracle:** A component within the data source that validates drifting credentials *based on drift profile metadata* embedded within the credential itself. The oracle understands the expected drift and will only accept credentials that fall within the defined parameters.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Request Initiation:** User submits a code execution request.
2.  **Drift Profile Generation:** System generates a unique drift profile for this request.  The profile details:
    *   *Drift Rate:* How frequently credentials are mutated (e.g., every 100ms, after each API call).
    *   *Drift Intensity:* The degree of mutation per drift cycle (e.g., flip 1 bit, swap 1 byte, add a small random number).
    *   *Drift Functions:* The specific functions to apply during mutation.
    *   *Drift Metadata:* This data, digitally signed, is included with the credential. It allows the Verification Oracle to validate the drifting credential.
3.  **Initial Credential Generation:**  A base credential is generated, authorizing access.
4.  **Credential Drift Loop (within execution):**
    *   The Drift Engine monitors execution (e.g., time elapsed, API calls made).
    *   Upon reaching a drift trigger, the Drift Engine:
        *   Applies a mutation function (selected from the drift profile) to the credential.
        *   Updates the drift metadata.
        *   The modified credential is used for the next API call/access request.
5.  **Verification:** The data source’s Verification Oracle:
    *   Receives the drifting credential and its metadata.
    *   Validates the metadata signature.
    *   Confirms that the credential’s drift aligns with the defined drift profile.
    *   If valid, grants access.

**3. Pseudocode (Drift Engine):**

```
function driftCredential(credential, driftProfile):
  driftMetadata = driftProfile.metadata
  mutationFunction = selectRandom(driftProfile.mutationFunctions)
  modifiedCredential = mutationFunction(credential)
  driftMetadata.timestamp = currentTime()
  driftMetadata.mutationCount++
  return modifiedCredential, driftMetadata

function selectRandom(functionList):
  randomIndex = randomNumber(0, length(functionList))
  return functionList[randomIndex]

//Within the execution loop:
while(executionOngoing):
  //...code execution...
  if(driftTriggerReached()):
    credential, metadata = driftCredential(credential, driftProfile)
    use credential for next access
```

**4. Potential Mutation Functions (examples):**

*   `bitFlip(credential)`: Flips a random bit within the credential.
*   `byteSwap(credential)`: Swaps two random bytes within the credential.
*   `additiveNoise(credential)`: Adds a small random number to a portion of the credential.
*   `flagToggle(credential)`: Toggles a non-critical flag within the credential.
*   `minorKeyRotation(credential)`: Rotates a portion of a symmetric key used within the credential (with constraints to maintain validity).

**5. Security Considerations:**

*   Drift intensity must be carefully balanced. Too much drift could invalidate the credential prematurely, while too little may not provide sufficient protection.
*   Metadata integrity is crucial. The metadata must be digitally signed to prevent tampering.
*   The Verification Oracle must be robust and resistant to attacks.
*   This approach adds overhead to the execution process.  Optimization is necessary.

This 'dynamic drift' extends the single-use credential concept by making even observed credentials rapidly obsolete, dramatically increasing the difficulty of any successful attack.
