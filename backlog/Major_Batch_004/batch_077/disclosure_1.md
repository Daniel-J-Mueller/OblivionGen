## Adaptive Environmental Storytelling System

**Concept:** Expand on the ‘stimulus’ aspect of the patent to create a system which uses scheduled actions triggered by environmental data *and* user preference to generate evolving, personalized ‘stories’ within a smart home. The system doesn't just *react* to stimuli, but weaves them into a narrative experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Environmental Sensor Integration:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate with existing smart home sensors (temperature, humidity, light, sound, motion, air quality). Extend beyond basic data collection to include specialized sensors like pollen count, UV index, even subtle vibrations (for potential activity detection - e.g., someone practicing a musical instrument).
*   **Data Fusion:** Employ a data fusion engine to correlate sensor data. E.g., low light + motion detected in the kitchen at 2 AM suggests a late-night snack run, which influences the ‘story’ element.
*   **Historical Data:** Maintain a historical record of environmental data for each room. This is crucial for establishing baseline 'normalcy' and detecting deviations.

**2. User Profile & Preference Modeling:**

*   **Explicit Preferences:** Users define preferences through a graphical interface (like the patent’s). Preferences include: Genre (e.g., Mystery, Sci-Fi, Relaxing), Mood (e.g., Energetic, Calm, Nostalgic), and Intensity (Subtle vs. Dramatic).
*   **Implicit Preference Learning:** Use machine learning to infer preferences based on user interactions (e.g., adjusted thermostat settings, music choices, lighting levels).
*   **Story Arc Templates:** Predefined story arc templates (e.g., 'Mysterious Guest', 'Forgotten Memory', 'Impending Storm') provide a framework. User preferences influence *how* that arc unfolds.

**3. Action Scheduling & Orchestration:**

*   **Stimulus-Action Rules:** Define rules that link environmental stimuli, user preferences, and scheduled actions.  For instance:
    *   `IF temperature drops below 18°C AND user preference = 'Nostalgic' THEN play ambient sounds of a crackling fireplace AND dim lights to 30% AND display a vintage photo on a smart display`.
    *   `IF pollen count is high AND user preference = 'Relaxing' THEN activate air purifier AND play calming music AND display nature scenes on a smart display AND gently diffuse lavender scent.`
*   **Dynamic Action Sequencing:**  Actions aren’t static.  The system dynamically sequences them based on evolving environmental conditions and user interactions.  A sequence might start with a gentle light change, followed by ambient sound, and culminating in a spoken narrative segment.
*   **Interruption Handling:** The system needs to gracefully handle interruptions. If a user overrides an action (e.g., turns on bright lights during a ‘Mysterious Guest’ sequence), the system should adapt the narrative accordingly, perhaps framing it as a sudden reveal.

**4. Narrative Engine:**

*   **Procedural Narrative Generation:** Generate short narrative segments (text-to-speech or pre-recorded audio) based on the current environmental conditions, user preferences, and the unfolding story arc.
*   **Character Integration:** Introduce virtual 'characters' (voiced by text-to-speech or pre-recorded audio) who interact with the user within the narrative. These characters could provide clues, offer guidance, or simply add to the atmosphere.
*   **Multi-Room Storytelling:** Extend the storytelling experience across multiple rooms. For example, a clue might be hidden in the ambient lighting of one room, while the solution is revealed through a sound effect in another.

**Pseudocode (Action Scheduling):**

```
function schedule_action(stimulus, user_preference, story_arc):
  actions = get_possible_actions(stimulus, user_preference, story_arc)
  
  //Prioritize actions based on intensity and story progress.
  prioritized_actions = sort_actions(actions, intensity, story_progress)
  
  //Select the next action to perform.
  next_action = prioritized_actions[0]
  
  //Schedule the action to be performed at a specified time or in response to a trigger.
  schedule(next_action, trigger)
  
  return next_action
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing smart home infrastructure (lights, thermostats, speakers, displays)
*   Specialized sensors (pollen counter, UV sensor)
*   High-quality audio equipment
*   Reliable network connectivity

This system aims to move beyond simple automation and create a truly immersive and personalized smart home experience.
