## Adaptive Peripheral Power Islands

**Concept:** Instead of a single quiescent doze mode, dynamically create “power islands” around peripherals based on predicted usage *and* current system load. This moves beyond simply gating clocks and self-refreshing memory; it allows for granular power control *even within* a doze state.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Dedicated power management IC (PMIC) with a high number of individually controllable power rails. This isn't just on/off; it supports variable voltage scaling down to near-threshold operation.
    *   Each major peripheral (GPU, USB controller, Wi-Fi module, etc.) has its own dedicated PMIC output, and potentially a small, local buck-boost converter for finer voltage control.
    *   High-speed switching circuitry (MOSFETs) on each power rail for fast on/off transitions with minimal inrush current.
    *   Current sensors on each rail for real-time power consumption monitoring.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Predictive Usage Model:** An AI-driven model that learns device usage patterns. This goes beyond simple reference counters; it considers time of day, location, user activity, and even environmental factors. Output is a probability distribution for each peripheral being used within a specified timeframe (e.g., 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%).
    *   **System Load Analyzer:** Real-time monitoring of CPU utilization, memory pressure, and I/O activity. This helps determine if the system is genuinely “idle” or just under low load.
    *   **Dynamic Power Island Manager:** The core component. It receives input from the Predictive Usage Model and System Load Analyzer and dynamically configures the power islands. Algorithm:
        1.  For each peripheral:
            *   Calculate a “Power Readiness Score” based on Predicted Usage Probability *and* System Load (higher load = higher readiness).
            *   If Readiness Score exceeds a threshold: maintain the peripheral in a low-power, but *responsive* state (e.g., retain some internal regulator power, enable a fast wake-up path).
            *   If Readiness Score is below the threshold: completely power down the peripheral.
        2.  Constantly re-evaluate the Readiness Scores and adjust the power islands accordingly.
*   **Pseudocode (Dynamic Power Island Manager):**

```
// Global Variables
peripheralList: Array of Peripheral Objects
systemLoad: Float (0.0 - 1.0)
usagePredictions: Dictionary (Peripheral ID -> Usage Probability)
powerIslandState: Dictionary (Peripheral ID -> Power State: ON, SLEEP, OFF)

// Function: Calculate Readiness Score
function calculateReadinessScore(peripheralID):
  usageProbability = usagePredictions[peripheralID]
  return usageProbability * (1 - systemLoad)

// Function: Update Power Islands
function updatePowerIslands():
  for each peripheral in peripheralList:
    readinessScore = calculateReadinessScore(peripheral.id)
    if readinessScore > threshold:
      setPeripheralPowerState(peripheral.id, "SLEEP") // Low-power, responsive
    else:
      setPeripheralPowerState(peripheral.id, "OFF") // Completely powered down

// Function: Set Peripheral Power State
function setPeripheralPowerState(peripheralID, state):
  // Implement hardware control logic to set power rail state
  // e.g., via PMIC control interface
  // Handle any necessary wake-up signaling
  // Update powerIslandState dictionary

// Main Loop
while (true):
  // Monitor System Load
  systemLoad = getSystemLoad()

  // Update Usage Predictions (via AI Model)
  usagePredictions = getUsagePredictions()

  // Update Power Islands
  updatePowerIslands()

  // Wait for a short interval
  sleep(100ms)
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply gating clocks and entering doze modes. It's about *intelligent* power management at a granular level, adapting to real-time conditions and predicting future needs. The integration of an AI-driven predictive model and dynamic system load analysis allows for a much more responsive and efficient power management system.
