## Dynamic Asset Pre-Fetching Based on Predicted Gaze

**Concept:** Extend client-side performance monitoring to incorporate predicted user gaze direction. Proactively pre-fetch digital assets likely to be within the user's immediate visual focus, anticipating viewport movement before it happens. This goes beyond simply optimizing what's *currently* visible; it predicts and prepares for what will be seen *next*.

**Specs:**

1.  **Gaze Prediction Module (Client-Side):** 
    *   Utilizes device sensors (eye-tracking hardware if available, otherwise webcam-based gaze estimation) to track userâ€™s gaze direction.
    *   Employs a short-term prediction algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter, recurrent neural network trained on typical viewport scrolling patterns) to forecast future gaze location within a small time window (50-200ms).
    *   Outputs predicted gaze coordinates (x, y) relative to the network document.

2.  **Asset Prioritization Server (Server-Side):**
    *   Receives predicted gaze coordinates from the client.
    *   Maintains a spatial index of all digital assets within the network document (image tiles, video segments, etc.).  This index maps asset location to asset ID/URL.
    *   Calculates a 'priority score' for each asset based on its proximity to the predicted gaze location.  Closer assets receive higher scores.
    *   Implements a dynamic threshold for priority scores. Assets exceeding the threshold are designated for pre-fetching. The threshold adjusts based on network conditions (latency, bandwidth) and user device capabilities.

3.  **Pre-Fetching Mechanism:**
    *   The client requests assets designated for pre-fetching from the server.
    *   Assets are cached locally on the client device.
    *   When the user's viewport does move to that location, the assets are immediately available, eliminating loading delays.

4.  **Data Collection & Feedback Loop:**
    *   Track the accuracy of gaze predictions (how often predicted assets are actually viewed).
    *   Collect data on asset loading times with and without pre-fetching.
    *   Use this data to refine the gaze prediction algorithm and the dynamic threshold for pre-fetching.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// Initialization
gazePredictor = new GazePredictionModule();
assetRequestor = new AssetRequestor();

// Main Loop
while (documentLoaded) {
  gazeCoordinates = gazePredictor.predictGazeCoordinates();
  potentialAssets = findAssetsNearCoordinates(gazeCoordinates);
  
  for (asset in potentialAssets) {
      if (asset.preFetchStatus == false) {
        assetRequestor.requestAsset(asset);
        asset.preFetchStatus = true;
      }
  }
  
  //Update prefetch status of assets that are no longer within the prediction horizon
  //for (asset in allAssets) {
  //    if(asset.isOutOfPredictionHorizon()){
  //       asset.preFetchStatus = false;
  //    }
  //}
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Asset`: {`id`, `url`, `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `preFetchStatus`}
*   `GazeCoordinates`: {`x`, `y`}

**Novelty:** The combination of real-time gaze prediction *with* dynamic, server-side asset prioritization and selective pre-fetching goes beyond existing viewport-based optimization techniques. Existing techniques react to the current viewport; this system anticipates future viewport movement, proactively optimizing the user experience.
