## Adaptive Packet Mirroring with Intent-Based Routing

**Concept:** Extend the encapsulation protocol processing component (EPPC) to not merely *collect* metrics, but to dynamically mirror/redirect encapsulated packets based on observed network health *and* higher-level application intent. This creates a proactive, self-healing network fabric.

**Specification:**

**1. Intent Definition Layer:**

*   A new "Intent Engine" component is introduced.  This receives high-level directives from network administrators or applications (e.g., "Prioritize VoIP traffic," "Isolate compromised VM," "Ensure low latency for database replication").
*   Intents are defined using a declarative language (YAML or JSON-based) specifying traffic characteristics (source/destination IPs, ports, protocols, VLANs, application tags), priority levels, and desired network behaviors (e.g., latency budgets, packet loss thresholds).

**2. EPPC Augmentation – Intelligent Mirroring:**

*   Each EPPC gains a "Mirroring Policy Manager" module.
*   This module receives active intent definitions from the Intent Engine.
*   During packet tracking, the EPPC doesn’t *just* collect metrics. It dynamically applies mirroring/redirection rules based on the observed metrics *and* the active intent definitions.
*   Mirroring can be performed in several ways:
    *   **Full Mirroring:**  Duplicate the encapsulated packet to a designated monitoring/analysis port.
    *   **Selective Mirroring:** Mirror only packets violating defined QoS parameters (e.g., high latency, packet loss).
    *   **Traffic Redirection:**  Dynamically reroute encapsulated packets through alternate paths (e.g., different network segments, faster links) based on observed congestion or failures.

**3. Path Computation & Control:**

*   An integrated "Path Computation Engine" (PCE) module is added.
*   The PCE uses real-time network health data (gathered by EPPCs) and intent definitions to calculate optimal paths for redirected traffic.
*   The PCE communicates with network devices (routers, switches) via standard protocols (e.g., BGP, PCEP) to program new forwarding rules.

**4.  Dynamic Policy Enforcement:**

*   The Mirroring Policy Manager continuously monitors packet metrics.
*   If metrics deviate from intent-defined thresholds, the EPPC triggers corresponding actions (mirroring, redirection).
*   The system automatically adapts to changing network conditions and application requirements.

**Pseudocode (Mirroring Policy Manager):**

```
function processEncapsulatedPacket(packet, intentDefinitions) {
  metrics = collectPacketMetrics(packet);
  intentMatch = findMatchingIntent(packet, intentDefinitions);

  if (intentMatch != null) {
    if (metricsViolateIntent(metrics, intentMatch)) {
      action = intentMatch.action; // e.g., "mirror", "redirect"

      if (action == "mirror") {
        mirrorPacket(packet, intentMatch.mirrorDestination);
      } else if (action == "redirect") {
        newPath = computeNewPath(packet, intentMatch);
        redirectPacket(packet, newPath);
      }
    }
  }
}

function computeNewPath(packet, intentMatch) {
  // Utilize PCE to calculate an optimized path
  // Consider factors like latency, bandwidth, congestion
  // Return the new path as a sequence of hops/interfaces
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   EPPC functionality integrated into network devices (virtual switches, routers, edge devices).
*   Intent Engine as a centralized management platform.
*   PCE software running on dedicated servers or integrated into network management systems.
*   Standard networking protocols (BGP, PCEP) for path computation and control.
