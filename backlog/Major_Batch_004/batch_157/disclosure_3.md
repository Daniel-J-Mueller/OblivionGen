## Dynamic Monitor Synthesis via Application Behavior Profiling

**Concept:** Instead of relying solely on predefined monitor classes or aggregated data, this system synthesizes *new* monitors on-the-fly based on observed application behavior. It’s about creating monitors tailored to the *specific* way an application is running, rather than assuming a ‘standard’ set of metrics will suffice.

**System Specs:**

*   **Behavior Profiler:** A lightweight agent deployed alongside the virtualized computing system.
    *   **Instrumentation:** Minimal, focusing on key application APIs (e.g., network I/O, database access, file system operations, threading, memory allocation).
    *   **Data Collection:** Captures timestamps, API arguments, return values, and thread IDs for profiled events.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Uses statistical methods (e.g., moving averages, standard deviations, machine learning models) to identify unusual patterns in API usage. Emphasis on *change* rather than absolute values.
*   **Monitor Synthesis Engine:**  A central service responsible for creating new monitors.
    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Analyzes anomaly reports from the Behavior Profiler to identify repeating, unexpected behavior sequences.
    *   **Monitor Blueprint Library:** A repository of predefined monitor templates (e.g., latency trackers, error rate counters, throughput meters). Templates are parameterized and adaptable.
    *   **Dynamic Monitor Creation:**  Combines appropriate blueprint templates with the specific parameters extracted from the observed behavior sequence.
    *   **Monitor Deployment:**  Installs the new monitor into the monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog)
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitors' data are analyzed.
    *   If monitor data are consistently irrelevant, the monitors are removed.
    *   If monitor data are consistently useful, the monitor parameters become pre-baked.

**Pseudocode - Monitor Synthesis Engine:**

```
function synthesize_monitor(anomaly_report):
    behavior_sequence = anomaly_report.sequence
    relevant_api_calls = identify_relevant_api_calls(behavior_sequence)
    monitor_type = determine_monitor_type(relevant_api_calls)  // e.g., latency, error rate, throughput
    
    if monitor_type == "latency":
        template = load_latency_template()
        template.api_call = relevant_api_calls[0]  // Parameterize with the specific API
        template.threshold = calculate_latency_threshold(behavior_sequence)
        new_monitor = template.instantiate()
    elif monitor_type == "error_rate":
        // Similar logic for other monitor types
        template = load_error_rate_template()
        template.api_call = relevant_api_calls[0]
        template.error_code = identify_error_code(behavior_sequence)
        new_monitor = template.instantiate()
    else:
        // Default monitor creation (e.g., simple counter)
        new_monitor = create_default_monitor()
    
    deploy_monitor(new_monitor)
    return new_monitor
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `AnomalyReport`: `{sequence: [API_CALL, API_CALL, ...], timestamp: TIME}`
*   `MonitorTemplate`: `{type: "latency", api_call: "...", threshold: NUM, ...}`
*   `Monitor`: `{name: "...", type: "...", api_call: "...", metrics: [...], ...}`

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static monitor definitions and predefined categories. It’s adaptive, learning from the application's unique behavior and creating monitors tailored to its specific needs, potentially uncovering issues missed by conventional monitoring approaches. This allows for early detection of unusual application behavior.
