## Adaptive Power Island Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the size and number of power islands within the integrated circuit based on real-time workload demands and thermal profiles. This goes beyond simply switching power gates *to* cores; it *reshapes* the power delivery network.

**Specs:**

*   **Granularity Levels:** Define at least three levels of power island granularity:
    *   **Coarse:** Entire processing core is a single island. (Current patent's approach.)
    *   **Medium:** Functional blocks *within* a core (e.g., ALU, FPU, cache) form individual islands.
    *   **Fine:** Individual pipeline stages or execution units within a functional block form islands.
*   **Island Switching Fabric:** Implement a crossbar switch network connecting the power islands to the primary power grid.  Each island can be independently powered or bypassed. Utilize a mix of traditional power gates and solid-state switches (e.g., MOSFETs) for fast switching speeds.
*   **Dynamic Island Mapping Controller:** A dedicated hardware block that monitors core workload (instruction mix, execution rates) and thermal sensors within each functional block. This controller determines the optimal island configuration for minimizing power consumption and managing temperature hotspots.  The controller uses a Reinforcement Learning algorithm, trained offline on a variety of workloads, to make dynamic decisions.
*   **Impedance Shaping:**  Instead of solely focusing on the *rate* of impedance change (as in the provided patent), *actively shape* the impedance profile of each power island. Incorporate programmable impedance elements (e.g., digitally controlled resistors or capacitors) into the power delivery path. These elements can be adjusted to optimize voltage droop, minimize switching noise, and improve overall power efficiency.
*   **Thermal Awareness:** Integrate thermal sensors *within* each functional block.  The Dynamic Island Mapping Controller prioritizes cooling by dynamically shrinking power islands in hotspots and shifting workloads to cooler areas.
*   **Power Budgeting:**  Implement a hierarchical power budgeting system. The top-level power budget is assigned to the entire chip. This budget is then dynamically distributed to individual power islands based on workload and thermal conditions.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Island Mapping Controller):**

```
// Initialize: Read chip power budget, map functional blocks to initial power islands

loop:
    read workload data (instruction mix, execution rates) for each functional block
    read thermal sensor data for each functional block

    // Calculate power demand for each functional block
    power_demand[i] = calculate_power_demand(workload[i])

    // Calculate thermal risk for each functional block
    thermal_risk[i] = calculate_thermal_risk(temperature[i])

    // Calculate optimal island configuration
    optimal_config = reinforcement_learning_model.predict(power_demand, thermal_risk, current_config)

    // Adjust power island boundaries
    for each change in optimal_config:
        merge_islands(island_A, island_B) // or split_island(island_C)
        adjust_power_gates(island_D)
        update_impedance_profile(island_E)

    // Monitor and log power consumption, temperature, and island configuration
```

**Novelty:** The core innovation lies in the *dynamic reshaping* of power islands. Existing approaches focus on switching power to static islands. This system *creates* and *destroys* islands on the fly, optimizing power delivery at a much finer granularity. The integration of Reinforcement Learning and programmable impedance elements further enhances its adaptability and efficiency.
