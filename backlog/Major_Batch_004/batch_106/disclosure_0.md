## Dynamic Reputation Scoring with Behavioral Anchoring

**Concept:** Extend the threat intelligence system to incorporate dynamic reputation scoring, not just for IP addresses, but for *behaviors* exhibited by network entities (endpoints, users, applications). This system will leverage a "behavioral anchor" – a baseline of normal activity – to detect deviations indicative of malicious intent, *even if* the source isn't currently on any threat list.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profile Generation:**

*   **Data Sources:** Network traffic logs (NetFlow, packet capture), endpoint telemetry (process execution, registry changes, file system access), user activity logs (authentication, application usage).
*   **Feature Extraction:** Identify key behavioral features:
    *   Network: Connection frequency, port usage, data transfer volume, protocol diversity, geographic distribution of connections.
    *   Endpoint: Process creation patterns, DLL loading, system call frequency, file access patterns.
    *   User: Login times, application usage patterns, data access patterns.
*   **Baseline Creation:**  Establish a baseline for each entity (endpoint, user, application) representing its "normal" behavior over a defined period (e.g., 7 days). Utilize statistical methods (mean, standard deviation, percentiles) to define acceptable ranges for each feature.  Employ anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify outliers.

**2. Dynamic Reputation Scoring:**

*   **Score Calculation:**  Assign a reputation score to each entity based on its deviation from its established baseline.  
    *   Deviations are weighted based on their severity and the importance of the corresponding feature.  (e.g., unusual outbound connections on a high-risk port receive a higher weight than a slight increase in CPU usage).
    *   Reputation score is a weighted average of individual feature deviations.
*   **Score Decay:** Implement a decay mechanism for the reputation score.  Recent deviations have a greater impact on the score than older deviations. This allows the system to adapt to changing behavior.
*   **Thresholding & Alerting:**  Define thresholds for the reputation score.  When an entity’s score exceeds a threshold, generate an alert. The severity of the alert should correspond to the magnitude of the deviation and the entity’s historical behavior.

**3. Behavioral Anchoring & Contextualization:**

*   **Anchor Points:** Create "anchor points" representing specific behavioral patterns. For example:
    *   "Successful login followed by large data exfiltration to a new geographic location."
    *   "Process spawning multiple child processes with unusual command-line arguments."
*   **Pattern Matching:** Monitor network traffic and endpoint activity for matches to predefined anchor points.  
*   **Contextual Enrichment:** Enrich alerts with contextual information about the entity, its behavior, and the detected anchor point.

**4. System Architecture**

*   **Data Ingestion:** Dedicated data collectors to ingest logs from various sources.
*   **Feature Extraction Engine:** Module responsible for extracting behavioral features from the ingested data.  Utilize machine learning models to identify complex behavioral patterns.
*   **Reputation Engine:** Core component responsible for calculating and maintaining the reputation score for each entity.
*   **Alerting & Reporting Module:** Generates alerts based on the reputation score and provides detailed reports on suspicious activity.
*   **API Integration:**  API endpoints for integrating with other security tools (SIEM, SOAR).

**Pseudocode (Reputation Engine):**

```
function calculate_reputation(entity_id, new_behavior_data):
  entity_profile = get_entity_profile(entity_id)
  baseline_features = entity_profile.baseline_features

  deviation_score = 0
  for feature, value in new_behavior_data:
    if feature in baseline_features:
      deviation = abs(value - baseline_features[feature])
      weighted_deviation = deviation * baseline_features[feature].weight
      deviation_score += weighted_deviation

  current_reputation = get_current_reputation(entity_id)
  decayed_reputation = current_reputation * decay_factor

  new_reputation = decayed_reputation + deviation_score

  set_current_reputation(entity_id, new_reputation)

  if new_reputation > threshold:
    generate_alert(entity_id, new_reputation)

  return new_reputation
```

This approach shifts the focus from solely relying on blacklists to proactively identifying anomalous behavior, providing a more robust and adaptive threat detection mechanism. It anticipates threats based on deviations from the 'norm', even before they manifest in known malicious activity.
