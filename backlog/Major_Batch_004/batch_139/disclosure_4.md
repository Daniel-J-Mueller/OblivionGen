## Decentralized Key Shard Consensus

**Concept:** Extend the security module concept to a distributed network where keys aren’t stored *in* a security module, but rather *reconstructed* by a consensus of security modules. This enhances resilience against both physical compromise and malicious insider threats.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Key Sharding:** A master key is algorithmically split into *n* shares. Each security module within a defined ‘trust domain’ holds exactly one share. No single share can reconstruct the master key. Shamir's Secret Sharing is a suitable candidate algorithm.

2.  **Dynamic Trust Domain:** The network dynamically assesses the trustworthiness of security modules. Trust scores are based on:
    *   **Hardware Attestation:** Modules periodically prove their hardware integrity (e.g., using Trusted Platform Modules).
    *   **Network Behavior:** Analysis of communication patterns for anomalies.
    *   **Consensus Participation:** Successful participation in key reconstruction attempts.
    *   **Tamper Evidence:** Reporting of physical compromise attempts.

3.  **Key Reconstruction Protocol:**
    *   When a cryptographic operation requires the master key, a request is broadcast to the trust domain.
    *   Modules with a trust score above a configurable threshold respond with their key share.
    *   A designated ‘coordinator’ (rotating role, selected based on trust score) collects shares.
    *   The coordinator uses a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft, Paxos) to verify the validity of the shares *before* reconstructing the master key. This prevents a malicious coalition from providing incorrect shares.
    *   Once consensus is achieved, the master key is reconstructed *only for the duration of the specific cryptographic operation*.  It is *never* persistently stored.

4.  **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT):** The consensus algorithm must be BFT to withstand malicious actors attempting to disrupt key reconstruction. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is a viable option.

5.  **Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC):** Leverage SMPC techniques to allow cryptographic operations to be performed directly on the key shares *without* ever reconstructing the master key. This provides additional security and performance benefits. 

6. **Ephemeral Key Rotation:** Implement a system where the master key (or a derived key) is rotated frequently (e.g., every hour, every transaction) using a deterministic key derivation function and a seed known only to the security modules. This limits the window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit a compromised key.

**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructKey(operationRequest):
  trustDomain = getTrustDomain()
  eligibleModules = filter(trustDomain, module.trustScore > threshold)
  shares = requestShares(eligibleModules)
  validShares = verifyShares(shares) //Using cryptographic signatures
  if len(validShares) >= requiredThreshold:
    reconstructedKey = combineShares(validShares)
    performOperation(operationRequest, reconstructedKey)
    destroyKey(reconstructedKey) //Ephemeral Key
  else:
    logError("Insufficient valid shares for key reconstruction")
    return failure

function verifyShares(shares):
    //Verify signatures and check for consistency
    //Reject shares that fail verification
    return validShares
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Each security module should include a Hardware Security Module (HSM) for secure key storage and cryptographic operations.
*   Secure communication channels (e.g., TLS with mutual authentication) between modules are essential.
*   Tamper-resistant hardware enclosures are recommended.
