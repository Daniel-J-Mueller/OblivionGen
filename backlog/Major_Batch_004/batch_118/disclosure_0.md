## Dynamic Notification 'Bubbles' - Ambient Awareness System

**Concept:** Expand on the identity-based display concept to create a system of personalized, spatially-aware notification 'bubbles' that float around the user, visible through the device’s camera (AR overlay). These aren’t traditional notifications, but rather ambient cues providing information without demanding direct attention.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Device with camera and AR capabilities (smartphone, AR glasses).
*   Depth sensor (optional, improves accuracy of spatial positioning).
*   Sufficient processing power for real-time image analysis and AR rendering.

**Software Components:**

*   **Identity Recognition Module:** (Utilizes existing patent’s image data analysis). Detects user and potentially other individuals in the environment.
*   **Communication Prioritization Engine:** Analyzes incoming communications (text, voice, app data) and assigns a relevance score based on sender, content, time sensitivity, and user history.
*   **Spatial Mapping & Rendering Engine:** Creates a real-time 3D map of the user’s surroundings using the camera (and depth sensor if available).  Renders the notification bubbles within this space.
*   **Bubble Customization Module:** Allows users to customize bubble appearance (size, color, transparency, icon) and behavior (persistence, animation).
*   **Ambient Light Adjustment:** Adapts bubble brightness and color based on surrounding lighting conditions.
*   **Gaze Tracking Integration:** (Optional) Adjusts bubble prominence or detail based on user's gaze direction, minimizing distraction.

**System Specs/Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop - runs continuously
function mainLoop() {
  captureImage();
  identifyUserAndEnvironment();

  // Get all incoming communications
  communications = getCommunications();

  // Prioritize communications
  prioritizedCommunications = prioritizeCommunications(communications);

  // Determine bubble positions based on user and environment
  bubblePositions = determineBubblePositions(prioritizedCommunications);

  // Render bubbles in AR view
  renderBubbles(bubblePositions);
}

// Function: prioritizeCommunications
function prioritizeCommunications(communications) {
    // Assign scores based on sender, content, time sensitivity, user history
    scoredCommunications = [];
    for (communication in communications) {
        score = calculateCommunicationScore(communication);
        scoredCommunications.push({communication: communication, score: score});
    }

    // Sort by score (highest first)
    sortedCommunications = sortByScore(scoredCommunications);

    return sortedCommunications;
}

// Function: determineBubblePositions
function determineBubblePositions(communications) {
    bubblePositions = [];

    //Position bubbles around the user. Use depth data to avoid obstructing real world objects.
    for (communication in communications) {
        //Determine the communication's urgency
        urgency = communication.urgency

        //Based on urgency determine bubble placement.
        if (urgency == "high"){
            //Place bubble near the user's hand
            bubblePosition = getHandPosition()
        }
        else{
            //Place bubble in peripheral vision.
            bubblePosition = getPeripheralVisionPosition()
        }

        bubblePositions.push(bubblePosition)
    }

    return bubblePositions
}
```

**Behavior:**

*   High-priority communications (urgent messages, calls) appear as bright, animated bubbles close to the user's hands or within immediate peripheral vision.
*   Lower-priority communications (social media updates, non-urgent emails) appear as smaller, more transparent bubbles in the broader periphery.
*   Bubbles are subtly animated to attract attention without being jarring.
*   Bubbles can be dismissed with a hand gesture or voice command.
*   The system learns user preferences over time, adjusting bubble placement and prominence based on interaction patterns.
*   Bubbles could also be location-aware, appearing near the source of the communication (e.g., a bubble near a smart appliance indicating a completed task).
