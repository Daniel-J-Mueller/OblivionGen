## Personalized Audio 'Bubbles' - Dynamic Spatial Audio Projection

**Concept:** Expand on the proximity-based audio delivery by creating dynamically adjustable "audio bubbles" around users, independent of device location. This moves beyond simply sending audio *to* a device, and focuses on projecting audio *around* a user in space.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of low-power, directional micro-speakers (integrated into existing device form factors – phones, smartwatches, wall-mounted units). Minimum 8 speakers per ‘zone’ (room/open space).
    *   Ultra-wideband (UWB) and/or high-precision Bluetooth direction finding capabilities in all participating devices.
    *   Environmental microphones to analyze room acoustics and adjust projection parameters.

*   **Software:**
    *   **User Profiling:** System learns user preferences for audio projection – preferred distance, volume levels, and directional emphasis.
    *   **Spatial Mapping:** Real-time creation of a 3D map of the environment using UWB/Bluetooth data. This map identifies user locations and obstacles.
    *   **Beamforming Algorithm:**  Advanced beamforming algorithm that dynamically adjusts the phase and amplitude of signals sent to each speaker, creating focused audio beams.  This isn’t a simple left/right panning; it’s full 3D control.
    *   **Audio Source Attribution:**  Algorithm determines the origin of the audio content (e.g., a phone call, a music stream, an announcement) to enhance the realism of spatial projection.
    *   **Collision Detection:**  Algorithm predicts audio beam paths and adjusts them to avoid obstacles or other users, minimizing unwanted interference.
    *   **Adaptive Equalization:**  Real-time room acoustic analysis via microphones and adjustment of speaker equalization curves for optimal sound quality.

*   **Operational Pseudocode:**

    ```
    //On User Movement:
    function onUserMovement(userID, newCoordinates):
        //Update user location in spatial map
        spatialMap.updateUserLocation(userID, newCoordinates)
        //Recalculate optimal speaker configurations for user
        speakerConfiguration = calculateSpeakerConfiguration(userID)
        //Send commands to speakers
        sendSpeakerCommands(speakerConfiguration)

    //On Audio Input
    function onAudioInput(audioSource, audioData):
        //Determine source location
        sourceLocation = audioSource.getLocation()
        //Spatialization - apply 3D effects
        spatializedAudio = spatialAudioEngine.processAudio(audioData, sourceLocation)

        //For each user:
        for each user in spatialMap.users:
            //Calculate optimal audio stream for user
            userStream = calculateUserStream(user, spatializedAudio)
            //Send user stream to speakers
            sendStreamToSpeakers(user, userStream)

    //Speaker Command Structure
    struct SpeakerCommand:
        speakerID: int
        volume: float
        pan: float
        equalization: array of floats
    ```

*   **Example Use Case:**  A family member makes a phone call. The system projects the caller's voice *as if they are physically present* a short distance from the receiving user, even if they are in a different room.  Announcements aren't just *heard*, they appear to originate from a specific location.  Music appears to emanate from the instrument/vocalist, creating an immersive experience.

*   **Potential Extensions:** Integration with AR/VR systems to create truly believable spatial audio. Dynamic adjustment of audio bubbles based on user activity (e.g., larger bubble when exercising).  Personalized 'soundscapes' that adapt to user mood and environment.
