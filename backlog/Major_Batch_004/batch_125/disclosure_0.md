## Dynamic Persona Synthesis for Proactive Assistance

**Concept:** Extend the system’s understanding of user preference beyond historical interaction data to *predictive* persona creation. Instead of solely reacting to requests, the system proactively anticipates needs by constructing dynamic user personas that evolve in real-time. This involves merging behavioral data with inferred emotional states and contextual awareness to facilitate more personalized and anticipatory assistance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Core Data:**

*   **Behavioral Profile:** (Existing – retained from patent) – Speech history, interaction frequency, preferred speechlet components, data types used.
*   **Emotional State Inference:**
    *   **Input:** Audio analysis (tone, pace, pauses), text sentiment analysis, video analysis (facial expressions, body language).
    *   **Model:** Train a recurrent neural network (RNN) to map audio/video/text features to emotional states (e.g., happy, frustrated, neutral, curious). Output a probability distribution across emotional states.
    *   **Integration:**  Emotional state probabilities are weighted and combined with behavioral data to create a “mood vector” appended to the core persona.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**
    *   **Data Sources:** Location (GPS), time of day, calendar events, environmental sensors (temperature, noise level).
    *   **Model:** Use a knowledge graph to represent contextual information and its relationships to user needs.  Example: “User is at airport, time is 8 AM” -> likely need: “flight information”, “directions to gate”, “coffee shop recommendations”.
*   **Proactive Need Prediction:**
    *   **Model:**  Train a generative model (e.g., Variational Autoencoder (VAE) or Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)) on historical persona data and successfully completed actions.  The model learns to predict likely user actions given a current persona state (behavioral, emotional, contextual).
    *   **Output:** Ranked list of predicted user needs (e.g., “user likely wants to know traffic to work”, “user likely wants to set an alarm for 7 AM”, “user likely wants to hear news headlines”).

**2. System Integration:**

*   **Persona Manager:** A dedicated module responsible for constructing and maintaining dynamic personas for each user. Receives data from all input sources (speech, video, sensors) and updates the persona core.
*   **Proactive Assistance Engine:**  Uses the output of the Persona Manager (predicted needs) to trigger proactive assistance.  Example: If the engine predicts the user will ask for directions, pre-fetch map data and display it on a device before the user asks.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Monitor user response to proactive assistance. If the user ignores or dismisses the assistance, penalize the prediction model and adjust the persona accordingly. Positive interaction reinforces the model.

**3. Pseudocode (Proactive Assistance Engine):**

```
function process_user_input(input_data, user_id):
  persona = PersonaManager.get_persona(user_id)
  predicted_needs = persona.predict_needs()

  for need in predicted_needs:
    if need.confidence > threshold:
      # Trigger proactive action
      action_result = execute_action(need.action)
      display_result(action_result)

      # Collect feedback
      feedback = get_user_feedback()
      update_model(feedback, need)

  # Process the actual user input as before
  process_normal_input(input_data)
```

**4. Data Structures:**

*   `Persona`:
    *   `behavioral_profile`: (Existing)
    *   `mood_vector`: (Emotional state probabilities)
    *   `contextual_data`: (Current contextual information)
*   `PredictedNeed`:
    *   `action`: (Function to execute)
    *   `confidence`: (Probability of need)
*   `ContextualData`:
    *   `location`: (GPS coordinates)
    *   `time`: (Current time)
    *   `calendar_events`: (List of events)

**Novelty:**

The existing patent focuses on *reactive* assistance. This design adds *predictive* capabilities through dynamic persona creation, incorporating emotional state and contextual awareness. This allows the system to anticipate needs *before* the user explicitly requests them, resulting in a significantly more proactive and personalized experience.
