## Modular Payload & Energy Harvesting System – UAV

**Concept:** A UAV system utilizing swappable, standardized payload modules coupled with integrated kinetic and thermal energy harvesting to augment or replace traditional battery power, increasing flight endurance and operational flexibility.

**Specifications:**

**1. Modular Payload Interface (MPI):**

*   **Physical:** Standardized mechanical and electrical interface (e.g., 100mm x 100mm x 50mm) for all payload modules.  Includes quick-release locking mechanism.  Interface supports up to 500W power draw/delivery.
*   **Communication:**  High-speed data bus (e.g., Ethernet/USB-C) for payload control and data transfer.  Supports multiple simultaneous connections.
*   **Power:** Provides regulated 12V, 24V, and 48V DC power to payloads.  Supports bidirectional power flow (payload can supply power to UAV).
*   **Mounting:**  Internal bay (capable of housing multiple modules) and external hardpoints on UAV frame.

**2. Energy Harvesting Modules:**

*   **Kinetic Harvesting Module:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Miniature wind turbine integrated into the MPI. Turbine blades extend into the airflow created by UAV propellers.
    *   **Generator:** High-efficiency micro-generator coupled to the turbine.
    *   **Output:**  Provides variable DC voltage (5V-24V) dependent on airspeed.  Includes DC-DC converter for voltage regulation.
    *   **Specification:** Target output of 20W at optimal airspeed (30m/s).
*   **Thermal Harvesting Module:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) attached to the MPI. TEGs capture heat generated by onboard components (e.g., processors, motors) and convert it into electricity.
    *   **Heat Sink:** Integrated heat sink to maximize temperature differential.
    *   **Output:** Provides low-voltage DC power (1V-5V) dependent on temperature gradient. Includes DC-DC boost converter.
    *   **Specification:** Target output of 5W under typical operating conditions.
*   **Piezoelectric Harvesting Module:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Piezoelectric elements integrated within the MPI frame to capture vibrations generated by UAV systems.
    *   **Output:** Variable DC voltage (0.5V-10V) dependent on frequency/amplitude of vibration.
    *   **Specification:** Target output of 2W.

**3. Power Management System (PMS):**

*   **Microcontroller:** Dedicated microcontroller to manage power flow from battery, harvesting modules, and MPI.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Dynamic Power Allocation:**  Prioritizes power delivery based on payload requirements and battery level.
    *   **Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT):** Optimizes energy harvesting from wind, thermal, and vibration sources.
    *   **Predictive Power Modeling:**  Estimates remaining flight time based on power consumption and harvesting rates.
*   **Battery Integration:** Seamless integration with existing UAV battery system.
*   **Communication:**  Provides real-time power status and control to the UAV flight controller.

**4. Payload Module Examples:**

*   **High-Resolution Camera Module:** Equipped with a stabilized camera and onboard processing for image analysis.
*   **Lidar/Sensor Array Module:**  Includes a lidar sensor and other environmental sensors for mapping and data collection.
*   **Communication Relay Module:**  Provides extended range communication capabilities.
*   **Customizable Module:** Allows users to create and integrate their own payloads.



**Pseudocode (PMS – Dynamic Power Allocation):**

```
// Variables
batteryLevel = getBatteryLevel();
payloadPowerDemand = getPayloadPowerDemand();
windPowerOutput = getWindPowerOutput();
thermalPowerOutput = getThermalPowerOutput();
piezoelectricPowerOutput = getPiezoelectricPowerOutput();

// Calculate total available power
totalPower = batteryPower + windPowerOutput + thermalPowerOutput + piezoelectricPowerOutput;

// If total power is sufficient, supply payload demand from available sources
if (totalPower >= payloadPowerDemand) {
    supplyPayloadPower(payloadPowerDemand);
} else {
    // Reduce payload power demand
    reducedPayloadPower = totalPower;
    supplyPayloadPower(reducedPayloadPower);
    // Alert operator/system of power limitation
}
```
