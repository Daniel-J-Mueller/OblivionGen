## Dynamic Relighting via Multi-Camera Depth & Spectral Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the multi-camera system to not only stitch panoramas but to reconstruct scenes with full spectral information, enabling dynamic relighting of the output video *after* capture. This moves beyond simply blending video feeds; it allows for alteration of light sources and material properties within the stitched scene.

**Specs:**

*   **Camera Hardware:**
    *   Each camera unit must include a standard RGB sensor *and* a multispectral sensor (at least 8 bands beyond visible light - near IR, UV, etc.).
    *   Each camera must incorporate a polarized filter to capture light polarization data.
    *   High-precision synchronization is critical – nanosecond accuracy required.
*   **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**
    *   Raw data streams from each camera (RGB, multispectral, polarization) are timestamped and sent to a central processing unit.
    *   Dark frame subtraction and flat-field correction are performed on each stream to remove sensor artifacts.
    *   Camera calibration is continuous – intrinsic and extrinsic parameters adjusted on the fly using feature tracking and bundle adjustment.
*   **Scene Reconstruction:**
    *   **Depth Map Generation:** Using stereo vision techniques (across multiple cameras, not just pairs), generate dense depth maps. Employ a cost function that considers both RGB and multispectral similarities to improve accuracy. The use of polarization data can refine surface normal estimation and thus depth accuracy.
    *   **Material Estimation:**  For each visible surface point, estimate the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). This requires analyzing the multispectral data at different viewing angles. A physically based rendering (PBR) model is used to represent material properties.
    *   **Light Source Estimation:** Analyze the spectral characteristics of the light reaching each camera to estimate the color, intensity, and direction of dominant light sources.  Polarization data assists in identifying specular reflections and disentangling direct and indirect illumination.
*   **Dynamic Relighting Engine:**
    *   **Virtual Light Source Placement:** Allow users to add, move, and adjust the color and intensity of virtual light sources within the reconstructed scene.
    *   **Material Editing:** Enable users to modify the BRDF parameters of individual materials within the scene.
    *   **Rendering Pipeline:** Using the reconstructed geometry, BRDFs, and light sources, render the scene from a desired viewpoint.  Implement advanced rendering techniques such as path tracing to achieve realistic lighting effects.
*   **Output:** The system outputs a relit video stream from the desired viewpoint, allowing for dynamic adjustment of the lighting and materials.

**Pseudocode (Relighting Engine - simplified):**

```
function relight_scene(scene_data, light_changes, material_changes, viewpoint):
    geometry = scene_data.geometry
    materials = scene_data.materials
    lights = scene_data.lights

    // Apply user-defined changes
    lights = apply_light_changes(lights, light_changes)
    materials = apply_material_changes(materials, material_changes)

    // Render the scene
    rendered_image = render(geometry, materials, lights, viewpoint)

    return rendered_image
```

**Novelty:**  Existing multi-camera systems focus primarily on image stitching or view synthesis.  This goes further by reconstructing the full spectral properties of the scene, enabling post-capture manipulation of lighting and materials – essentially treating the captured video as a 3D scene that can be re-lit and re-rendered. The integration of polarization data to enhance depth accuracy and material estimation is also a key differentiator.
