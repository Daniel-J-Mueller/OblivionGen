## Decentralized Reputation Scoring with Verifiable Credentials

**Concept:** Extend the key derivation and verification system to manage reputation scores, distributed across key-use zones, linked to verifiable credentials, and dynamically adjusted based on zone-specific interactions. This moves beyond simple authentication to a trust/reputation system operating at a granular, decentralized level.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Data Structures:**

*   **Reputation Vector:**  Each entity (user, device, service) possesses a reputation vector. This vector has a dimension equal to the number of key-use zones. Each element in the vector represents the entity’s reputation *within* that specific zone.
*   **Verifiable Credential Template:**  A standardized template defining the attributes included in reputation-linked credentials.  Attributes include: entity identifier, zone identifier, reputation score (encrypted), timestamp, issuing authority (zone identifier), and a digital signature.
*   **Zone-Specific Trust Parameters:** Each key-use zone maintains a set of parameters defining how interactions affect reputation. These include weighting factors for different interaction types (e.g., successful transaction, positive review, dispute resolution) and decay rates for reputation scores over time.

**2. Key Derivation and Reputation Binding:**

*   **Reputation Key Derivation:**  Alongside authentication key derivation, a "reputation key" is derived. This key is generated using the password, first salt, a second salt, *and* the current reputation vector.  This binds the reputation to the authentication process.
*   **Credential Generation:**  Upon a significant interaction (positive or negative), the key-use zone generates a verifiable credential.  The credential includes the reputation score *at the time of the interaction*, signed by the zone authority. The reputation key is used to encrypt the score before signing.  The credential is distributed to the entity and potentially other relevant zones.

**3. Reputation Vector Updates:**

*   **Zone-Local Update:** Each zone maintains a local reputation database. Incoming credentials are validated (signature, timestamp, zone authority).  The reputation vector element for the entity is updated based on the credential’s score and the zone-specific trust parameters.
*   **Cross-Zone Propagation:**  A secure communication channel enables zones to propagate reputation updates to each other.  This propagation can be based on a “trust web” – zones only share updates with zones they trust.  A weighted average can be used to combine reputation scores from different zones.

**4. Authentication with Reputation Check:**

*   **Reputation-Aware Authentication:**  During authentication, the system retrieves the entity’s reputation vector from the relevant key-use zone.
*   **Dynamic Access Control:** Access control policies can be dynamically adjusted based on the entity’s reputation.  For example, a high-reputation user might be granted access to more resources or be subject to less stringent security checks.
*   **Threshold Based Authentication:**  Authentication can *fail* if the reputation score falls below a predefined threshold, even if the password is correct.

**Pseudocode (Authentication with Reputation Check):**

```
function Authenticate(password, entityId, zoneId):
  preliminaryKey = DerivePreliminaryKey(password, firstSalt)
  keyHash = DeriveKeyHash(secondSalt, zoneIdKeyDerivationParameter)
  verificationKey = GenerateVerificationKey(preliminaryKey, keyHash)

  // Reputation Retrieval
  reputationVector = GetReputationVector(entityId, zoneId)
  reputationScore = reputationVector[zoneId]

  // Reputation Check
  if (reputationScore < minimumReputationThreshold) {
    return AuthenticationFailed("Reputation too low")
  }

  // Standard Password Verification (using verificationKey)
  if (VerifyPassword(password, verificationKey)) {
    return AuthenticationSuccessful()
  } else {
    return AuthenticationFailed("Invalid password")
  }
```

**Novelty & Potential:**

This builds on the existing system by adding a dynamic reputation layer.  The reputation isn’t a centralized score, but a distributed vector.  The use of verifiable credentials allows for auditable reputation changes.  This could enable trust-based access control, fraud prevention, and personalized services in a decentralized and privacy-preserving manner. The integration of reputation *into* the authentication process itself adds a significant security benefit.
