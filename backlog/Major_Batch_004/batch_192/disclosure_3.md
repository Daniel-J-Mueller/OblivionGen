## Adaptive Interference Cancellation via Swarm Learning

**Concept:** Leverage the distributed nature of user terminals (UTs) to create a real-time, adaptive interference cancellation (AIC) system, utilizing a swarm learning approach to train localized AIC models without central data collection.

**Specification:**

**I. System Components:**

*   **UT AIC Module:** Each UT hosts an AIC module comprising:
    *   Local Dataset: Continuously collects radio frequency (RF) environment samples (interference signatures, signal strength, noise floor). This data *remains* local to the UT.
    *   Local Model: A small, lightweight machine learning model (e.g., a shallow neural network, support vector machine) designed to predict and cancel interference.
    *   Differential Privacy Layer: Implemented *before* model updates are shared to ensure privacy.
    *   Communication Interface: Facilitates model update sharing with neighboring UTs.
*   **Swarm Learning Coordinator (SLC):** A lightweight server (could be hosted on a subset of UTs or dedicated infrastructure) that manages the swarm learning process. It *does not* store raw data.
*   **RF Front-End (RFFE):** Existing RFFE within each UT. Modification needed to feed environment samples to the UT AIC module.

**II. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Local Training:** Each UT continuously trains its local AIC model using its RF environment samples.
2.  **Model Aggregation:**
    *   Periodically (e.g., every few seconds), each UT generates a *model difference* – the change in its model weights since the last aggregation.
    *   This difference is encrypted (using differential privacy) and shared with a small, dynamically selected group of neighboring UTs (determined by proximity, signal quality, or network topology).
    *   Each UT receives model differences from its neighbors.
    *   Each UT applies the received model differences to its local model.  A weighted average or a more sophisticated aggregation scheme (e.g., federated averaging) can be used.
3.  **Dynamic Neighbor Selection:** The SLC facilitates dynamic neighbor selection. UTs periodically exchange information about their RF environment characteristics (e.g., dominant interferers, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)).  The SLC uses this information to identify UTs experiencing similar interference patterns and forms temporary "swarms" for model aggregation.  This ensures that UTs are learning from peers in similar RF environments.
4.  **RFFE Integration:** The trained AIC model within each UT controls the adaptive filtering within the RFFE, dynamically cancelling detected interference.  The AIC model effectively "pre-processes" the incoming signal, improving the SINR before demodulation.

**III. Pseudocode (UT AIC Module):**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
model = InitializeAICModel()
data_buffer = EmptyBuffer()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Data Acquisition
  rf_sample = AcquireRFSample()
  data_buffer.Add(rf_sample)

  // 2. Model Training
  if (data_buffer.Size() >= threshold) {
    model.Train(data_buffer)
    data_buffer.Clear()
  }

  // 3. Swarm Learning (Periodic)
  if (time % aggregation_interval == 0) {
    model_difference = CalculateModelDifference(model)
    encrypted_difference = EncryptWithDifferentialPrivacy(model_difference)
    SendToNeighbors(encrypted_difference)

    received_differences = ReceiveFromNeighbors()
    for each difference in received_differences:
      decrypted_difference = Decrypt(difference)
      model.ApplyDifference(decrypted_difference)
  }

  // 4. Interference Cancellation
  filtered_signal = CancelInterference(received_signal, model)
  SendToDemodulator(filtered_signal)
}
```

**IV. Innovation:**

*   **Decentralized AIC:** Moves interference cancellation away from centralized processing, reducing latency and improving scalability.
*   **Swarm Learning for RF Adaptability:**  Leverages the collective intelligence of the UT network to adapt to rapidly changing RF environments *without* sharing sensitive RF data.
*   **Privacy-Preserving:**  Differential privacy ensures that individual UTs’ RF data remains confidential.
*   **Dynamic Swarm Formation:** Adapts to RF heterogeneity by forming temporary swarms of UTs experiencing similar interference.

**V. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Employ reinforcement learning to optimize swarm formation and model aggregation strategies.
*   **Multi-Agent Systems:**  Formalize the swarm learning process using multi-agent system techniques.
*   **Edge Computing Integration:**  Deploy a lightweight SLC on edge servers to facilitate more efficient swarm coordination.
