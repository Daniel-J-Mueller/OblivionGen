## Adaptive Narrative Branching via Gaze-Contingent Storytelling

**Concept:** Dynamically alter a video narrative *during* playback based on nuanced user gaze data, creating a personalized and immersive experience that goes beyond simple advertisement placement. Instead of just optimizing *where* ads appear, we alter the storyline itself.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Processing Module:**

*   **Gaze Tracker Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with existing eye-tracking hardware and software. Supports variable frame rates (30Hz - 200Hz) for optimal data capture without performance bottlenecks.
*   **Gaze Vector Analysis:**  Tracks pupil center, gaze direction, and dwell time on specific areas of the video frame.  Calculates ‘interest scores’ based on gaze data (longer dwell = higher score).
*   **Emotional State Estimation:**  Employ a real-time emotion recognition module (using facial expression analysis alongside gaze data – potentially using a separate camera feed) to assess user emotional response (e.g., happiness, surprise, fear). Combines emotional state with gaze data for a more nuanced understanding of user engagement.
*   **Scene Segmentation:**  Automatically segments the video into discrete scenes or 'story beats'.

**2. Narrative Database & Branching Logic:**

*   **Pre-authored Story Branches:**  A library of pre-authored video segments (alternate scenes, character interactions, subplots) designed to be seamlessly integrated into the main narrative. Each branch is tagged with metadata indicating emotional tone, character focus, and required narrative context.  Metadata will be tagged with emotional valence and arousal.
*   **Branching Rules Engine:**  A rule-based system that determines when and how to switch to alternate story branches. Rules are defined based on combinations of:
    *   Gaze-derived interest scores on key narrative elements (characters, objects, locations).
    *   User emotional state (e.g., if the user appears bored or frustrated, a more action-packed branch might be triggered).
    *   Narrative context (ensuring branches maintain story coherence).
*   **Dynamic Story Coherence:**  An algorithm that intelligently adjusts the transitions between story branches to minimize jarring cuts or inconsistencies. This could involve using visual effects, voiceover narration, or brief transitional scenes.

**3. Real-time Video Switching & Rendering:**

*   **Seamless Video Stitching:**  A high-performance video rendering engine capable of seamlessly switching between video segments in real-time without perceptible lag or stutter. Utilize techniques like frame blending and crossfading.
*   **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming:**  Dynamically adjust video quality based on network conditions and device capabilities.
*   **Multi-Platform Support:**  Develop the system to be compatible with a range of devices, including computers, mobile devices, and virtual reality headsets.

**Pseudocode for Branching Logic:**

```
// Variables
current_scene : Scene
user_gaze_data : GazeData
user_emotion : Emotion
branching_rules : List<Rule>

// Function: DetermineNextScene
function DetermineNextScene(current_scene, user_gaze_data, user_emotion, branching_rules):
    // Apply branching rules
    for rule in branching_rules:
        if rule.matches(current_scene, user_gaze_data, user_emotion):
            next_scene = rule.next_scene
            return next_scene

    // If no rules match, continue with the default next scene
    return current_scene.next_scene
```

**Example Rule:**

*   **Condition:** User’s gaze fixates on a mysterious object for > 3 seconds AND user emotion is "curiosity".
*   **Action:** Switch to a story branch that reveals more information about the object.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Interactive storytelling
*   Personalized entertainment experiences
*   Educational content tailored to individual learning styles
*   Immersive training simulations.
