## Adaptive Register Granularity & Dynamic Data Aggregation

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting the granularity of data collection from registers, coupled with real-time data aggregation tailored to observed system states.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on periodically collecting data from registers. This design expands on that by introducing the ability to *selectively* collect data at different granularities (e.g., full register value, delta since last read, bitfield selections) *and* aggregate this data *before* it reaches the CPU. This reduces bandwidth consumption and CPU load, while offering more nuanced insights.

**Components:**

*   **Register Map & Granularity Profiles:** Each register is associated with multiple "granularity profiles." A profile defines *what* data is extracted from the register (full value, specific bits, delta, statistical summaries like min/max/average), and the *rate* at which it is extracted.
*   **State Observer:** A dedicated module that monitors key system parameters (network traffic, CPU utilization, memory usage, etc.). The State Observer doesn't *process* the data, only *identifies* states.
*   **Profile Selection Engine:** Based on the current system state (as reported by the State Observer), this engine selects the optimal granularity profile for each register. The profiles are stored in a lookup table indexed by system state.
*   **Dynamic Aggregation Unit:** This unit receives data from the registers based on the selected profiles. It performs real-time aggregation (summation, averaging, counting, histogramming, etc.) based on configurable rules. The aggregation rules can also be state-dependent.
*   **Filtered Data Path:** The aggregated data, rather than raw register values, is then sent to the CPU via DMA.

**Pseudocode (Profile Selection Engine):**

```
// Define System States
ENUM SystemState {
    NORMAL,
    HIGH_TRAFFIC,
    LOW_POWER,
    ERROR_DETECTED
}

// Define Granularity Profiles (example)
STRUCT GranularityProfile {
    DataFormat format; // FULL, DELTA, BITFIELD
    Rate rate; // samples per second
}

// Lookup Table (mapping SystemState to RegisterID -> GranularityProfile)
MAP<SystemState, MAP<RegisterID, GranularityProfile>> profileLookupTable;

// Function to select profile
GranularityProfile selectProfile(SystemState currentState, RegisterID registerID) {
    // Check if current state exists in profileLookupTable
    IF profileLookupTable.contains(currentState) {
        // Get profile for register from current state
        RETURN profileLookupTable[currentState][registerID];
    } ELSE {
        // Default to full value at low rate
        RETURN defaultProfile;
    }
}
```

**Operation:**

1.  The State Observer monitors system parameters.
2.  Based on observed parameters, the State Observer identifies the current System State.
3.  The Profile Selection Engine uses the current System State and the `profileLookupTable` to determine the optimal granularity profile for each register.
4.  Registers output data according to their selected profiles.
5.  The Dynamic Aggregation Unit aggregates the data based on configurable rules.
6.  The aggregated data is transferred to the CPU via DMA.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Bandwidth:**  By selectively collecting data and pre-aggregating it, the amount of data transferred to the CPU is minimized.
*   **Reduced CPU Load:** The CPU spends less time processing raw register values.
*   **Improved Insights:** Pre-aggregation can reveal trends and anomalies that might be hidden in raw data.
*   **Adaptive Performance:** The system can adapt to changing conditions and prioritize data collection accordingly.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** The ability to define custom granularity profiles and aggregation rules provides fine-grained control over data collection.
