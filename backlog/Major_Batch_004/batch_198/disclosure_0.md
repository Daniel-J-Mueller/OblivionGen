## Adaptive Operation Delegation via Semantic Drift

**Concept:** Extend the tag-based authorization to dynamically adjust access based on observed operational ‘drift’ – changes in resource usage, execution time, or output characteristics – detected during runtime.  Instead of static tags, introduce ‘drift thresholds’ that, when breached, trigger temporary privilege escalation or de-escalation.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Drift Monitor Module
    *   **Input:** Real-time telemetry data from invoked programming interfaces (resource consumption, execution time, output metrics, error rates).
    *   **Processing:**
        *   Define 'drift profiles' for each tag.  These profiles specify acceptable ranges for telemetry metrics.  Example: Tag "DatabaseRead" has drift profile: CPU < 80%, Memory < 500MB, Latency < 200ms.
        *   Continuously monitor telemetry against drift profiles.
        *   Calculate ‘drift score’ – a weighted sum of deviations from the defined ranges.
        *   Thresholds: Define 'escalation threshold' and 'de-escalation threshold' for each tag.
    *   **Output:** Drift score, escalation/de-escalation signals.

*   **Component:** Dynamic Authorization Manager
    *   **Input:** Drift score, escalation/de-escalation signals, Security Principal identity, Programming Interface identifier.
    *   **Processing:**
        *   Receive drift signals from the Drift Monitor.
        *   If drift score exceeds escalation threshold: Temporarily grant additional privileges to the Security Principal for the invoked Programming Interface.  (Example: Read-only access becomes read-write, or increased rate limiting is allowed).
        *   If drift score falls below de-escalation threshold: Revoke temporarily granted privileges, reverting to the baseline authorization.
        *   Log all privilege adjustments with justifications (drift score, timestamp, Security Principal, Programming Interface).
    *   **Output:** Authorization decision (allow/deny), updated privilege set.

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   **Drift Profile:** `{tag_id: string, metrics: [{name: string, upper_bound: float, lower_bound: float, weight: float}], escalation_threshold: float, de_escalation_threshold: float}`
    *   **Runtime Context:** `{security_principal: string, programming_interface: string, current_privileges: list[string], drift_score: float}`

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Authorization Manager):**

```
function authorize_request(security_principal, programming_interface):
  runtime_context = get_runtime_context(security_principal, programming_interface)
  drift_score = runtime_context.drift_score
  
  base_privileges = get_base_privileges(security_principal, programming_interface)
  
  if drift_score > get_escalation_threshold(programming_interface):
    escalated_privileges = apply_escalation_policy(base_privileges, programming_interface)
    current_privileges = escalated_privileges
    log_event("Privilege escalated due to drift: " + drift_score)
  elif drift_score < get_de_escalation_threshold(programming_interface):
    current_privileges = base_privileges
    log_event("Privilege de-escalated due to drift: " + drift_score)
  else:
    current_privileges = base_privileges

  if has_permission(current_privileges, requested_action):
    return ALLOW
  else:
    return DENY
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond static authorization by dynamically adjusting access based on runtime behavior. It addresses scenarios where normal operational patterns change, potentially indicating anomalies or requiring temporary adjustments to privileges to maintain service stability.  It's an active, self-adjusting security layer on top of the existing tag-based system.
