## Beacon-Based Dynamic Environmental Mapping

**Concept:** Leveraging beacon signals not just for message delivery, but for creating a dynamic, localized environmental map. Think of it as a low-power, beacon-driven LiDAR alternative.

**Specs:**

*   **Beacon Hardware Enhancement:** Modify existing beacon emitters to include a micro-accelerometer and a basic directional microphone. The accelerometer captures movement/vibration data, and the microphone captures ambient sound pressure levels. These sensors need minimal power draw.
*   **Beacon Signal Protocol:** Expand the beacon signal data fields. Add fields for:
    *   Accelerometer X, Y, Z readings (short integer format)
    *   Microphone dB reading (single byte integer)
    *   Timestamp (relative to beacon emission â€“ short integer)
    *   Beacon ID (unique identifier for each beacon)
*   **Receiver/Mapping Device:** A dedicated receiver (could be integrated into a mobile device) scans for beacons.
*   **Mapping Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
// Initialize empty 3D point cloud map
map = new PointCloud()

// Loop while receiving beacon signals
while (signalReceived) {
  // Extract beacon data
  beaconID = signal.beaconID
  accelerationX = signal.accelerationX
  accelerationY = signal.accelerationY
  accelerationZ = signal.accelerationZ
  dB = signal.dB
  timestamp = signal.timestamp

  // Calculate approximate beacon location (based on known/registered locations)
  beaconLocation = getKnownLocation(beaconID)

  // Convert acceleration data to force vectors (approximate). Requires calibration.
  forceX = accelerationX * beaconMass 
  forceY = accelerationY * beaconMass
  forceZ = accelerationZ * beaconMass

  // Estimate directional sound source (using microphone data - requires calibration + signal processing).
  soundDirection = estimateSoundDirection(dB)

  // Add a 'point' to the 3D map.
  point = new Point(beaconLocation.x + forceX, beaconLocation.y + forceY, beaconLocation.z + forceZ, soundDirection)
  map.addPoint(point)

  // Apply smoothing/filtering to the point cloud to reduce noise.
  map.smooth()
}
```

*   **Calibration:** Crucial. Each beacon/receiver pairing will require initial calibration to translate acceleration/sound data into meaningful spatial offsets. This could be a user-guided process within a mobile app.
*   **Applications:**
    *   **Indoor Navigation:** Create dynamic maps of indoor spaces, highlighting movement/activity.
    *   **Object Detection:** Identify potential obstacles/moving objects based on anomalies in the point cloud.
    *   **Environmental Monitoring:** Map soundscapes and vibration levels within a space.
    *   **Security:** Detect unusual activity or intrusions based on movement patterns.
*   **Power Considerations:** Optimized beacon transmission schedules and low-power sensor operation are essential.
*   **Data Transmission:** Use existing beacon signal infrastructure for data transfer. Explore compression techniques for sensor data.
