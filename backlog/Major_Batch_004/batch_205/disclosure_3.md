# 10924410

## Dynamic Service Mesh Adaptation via Predictive Call Ratio Modeling

**Specification:** A system for proactively adjusting service mesh configurations based on predicted call ratios and anticipated load, leveraging the call path analysis detailed in patent 10924410.

**Core Concept:** Existing service mesh implementations react to observed load. This system *predicts* future load based on historical call ratios and external factors, pre-provisioning resources and adjusting traffic routing before congestion occurs. This goes beyond simply scaling instances; it proactively reshapes the service mesh topology.

**Components:**

1.  **Call Ratio Historian:** Continuously stores estimated call ratios (as defined in patent 10924410) over time, segmented by time intervals (e.g., 5-minute, 1-hour, daily).  Data is stored with associated metadata (timestamp, source/destination services, API calls involved).

2.  **External Factor Input:**  Ingests data from external sources that might influence service load. Examples:
    *   Scheduled events (marketing campaigns, batch jobs).
    *   Real-time user activity data (website traffic, mobile app usage).
    *   Geographic location (impact of regional events).
    *   Social media trends (potential spikes in demand).

3.  **Predictive Modeling Engine:** Employs time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM networks) to predict future call ratios.  The model is trained on historical call ratio data *and* external factor data.  Separate models can be trained for different service pairs or API calls.
    *   **Input:** Historical call ratios, external factor data, time window for prediction (e.g., next 15 minutes).
    *   **Output:** Predicted call ratios with associated confidence intervals.

4.  **Service Mesh Adaptation Controller:** Interprets predicted call ratios and adjusts the service mesh configuration.
    *   **Dynamic Routing:**  Adjusts traffic routing weights between service instances based on predicted load.  Instances predicted to be heavily loaded receive less traffic.
    *   **Pre-Provisioning:** Automatically scales up or down service instances *before* load increases. Scaling decisions are based on predicted call ratios and resource availability.  Considers both horizontal (adding more instances) and vertical (increasing instance capacity) scaling.
    *   **Circuit Breaking:**  Proactively initiates circuit breaking for services predicted to be overloaded, preventing cascading failures.
    *   **Topology Reshaping:** Temporarily adjusts the service mesh topology based on predicted call patterns. This could involve routing traffic through different API calls or service instances to optimize performance.

**Pseudocode (Service Mesh Adaptation Controller):**

```
function adapt_service_mesh(predicted_call_ratios, current_service_mesh_config):
  for service_pair in predicted_call_ratios:
    predicted_ratio = predicted_call_ratios[service_pair]
    confidence_interval = predicted_call_ratios[service_pair].confidence_interval

    if predicted_ratio > current_service_mesh_config[service_pair].traffic_weight + confidence_interval:
      # Increase traffic weight to the destination service
      current_service_mesh_config[service_pair].traffic_weight += (predicted_ratio - current_service_mesh_config[service_pair].traffic_weight) * 0.1
    elif predicted_ratio < current_service_mesh_config[service_pair].traffic_weight - confidence_interval:
      # Decrease traffic weight to the destination service
      current_service_mesh_config[service_pair].traffic_weight -= (current_service_mesh_config[service_pair].traffic_weight - predicted_ratio) * 0.1

    if predicted_ratio > overload_threshold:
      # Initiate circuit breaking and pre-provision resources
      pre_provision_resources(service_pair)
      initiate_circuit_breaking(service_pair)

  update_service_mesh(current_service_mesh_config)
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Call Ratio Historian stores historical call ratio data.
2.  External Factor Input provides real-time data.
3.  Predictive Modeling Engine generates predicted call ratios.
4.  Service Mesh Adaptation Controller interprets predictions and adjusts the service mesh.
5.  Updated service mesh configuration is deployed.

**Novelty:** Proactive adaptation based on *predicted* call ratios, incorporating external factors. This goes beyond reactive scaling and improves system resilience and performance. The topology reshaping aspect is particularly novel.
