## Dynamic Path Stitching with Predictive Failure Zones

**Concept:** Expand beyond pre-defined waypoint selection to a system that *dynamically* stitches together short, highly-available paths in real-time, anticipating and circumventing potential failure zones *before* they impact transmission. This goes beyond simple diversification by creating a constantly adapting, almost fractal, network route.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Failure Modeling (PFM) Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time network telemetry (latency, packet loss, bandwidth utilization) from across the backbone network. Historical failure data correlated with geographical location, time of day, and known infrastructure vulnerabilities (construction schedules, weather patterns). Data sourced from network monitoring tools, external APIs (weather, construction permits), and potentially, even social media (reports of local outages).
*   **Processing:** Uses machine learning (specifically, time series forecasting and anomaly detection) to predict potential network congestion or failures along existing and potential paths.  Outputs “failure probability maps” overlaid on the network topology. Maps indicate likelihood of disruption along each link and node.  Each link/node is assigned a 'risk score'.
*   **Output:**  Risk score map.  A constantly updated, granular view of network health and vulnerability.

**2. Shortest Available Path (SAP) Algorithm:**

*   **Input:**  Origin and destination nodes, current Risk Score Map.
*   **Processing:** Unlike traditional shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, A*), SAP prioritizes *available* bandwidth and *low risk* over absolute distance. The cost function is modified to include a ‘risk penalty’ based on the Risk Score of each link. The algorithm identifies a series of short, consecutive links with high availability and low risk.
*   **Output:**  A "stitched" path comprised of multiple short, highly-available links.  Path represented as a sequence of node IDs.

**3. Adaptive Path Switching (APS) Module:**

*   **Input:** Current Active Path, Real-time network telemetry, updated Risk Score Maps.
*   **Processing:** Continuously monitors the Active Path for degradation. If the Risk Score of any segment exceeds a pre-defined threshold, APS proactively triggers the SAP algorithm to identify an alternative path segment. The transition is designed to be seamless, with minimal packet loss. If a failure *does* occur, APS rapidly switches to the pre-calculated alternate path.
*   **Output:**  Dynamically adjusted Active Path.

**4. Path Stitching Protocol (PSP):**

*   A lightweight protocol for propagating risk scores and available bandwidth information throughout the network. PSP nodes periodically broadcast their local risk scores and bandwidth to their immediate neighbors. This information is aggregated and propagated across the network, allowing nodes to build a comprehensive view of network health.
*   Supports prioritization of traffic based on criticality. High-priority traffic can be assigned lower risk thresholds, triggering more frequent path adjustments.

**Pseudocode (APS Module):**

```
function AdaptivePathSwitch(ActivePath, NetworkTelemetry, RiskScoreMap):
  while True:
    for segment in ActivePath:
      if RiskScoreMap[segment] > RiskThreshold:
        NewPathSegment = SAP(segment.destination, destination, RiskScoreMap)
        Replace segment with NewPathSegment in ActivePath
        Log Path Change
        break //Only switch one segment at a time for stability
    Wait(monitoringInterval) //Check every X milliseconds
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Network devices capable of running the APS and PSP software (routers, switches).
*   Centralized server(s) for running the PFM module and aggregating network telemetry.
*   High-bandwidth network connections between devices for real-time data exchange.
*   Machine learning libraries and frameworks for implementing the PFM module.
