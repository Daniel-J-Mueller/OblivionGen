## Dynamic Data Provenance & Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the metadata tracking described in the patent to include a dynamic trust score for each data element, factoring in not just version but source reliability and potential manipulation. This enables the system to proactively mitigate risks associated with suspect data, beyond simply ceasing processing.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Provenance Graph:** Implement a graph database to store a complete history of each data element, tracking its origin, all transformations applied, the components responsible, timestamps, and associated metadata. Each node represents a data element, and edges represent transformations.
*   **Trust Score Calculation:**
    *   **Source Reputation:** Assign a base trust score to data sources based on historical reliability (e.g., verified APIs, internal systems, user submissions).
    *   **Transformation Impact:**  Quantify the potential impact of each transformation on data integrity.  Simple operations (e.g., formatting) have low impact, while complex algorithms (e.g., prediction models) have higher impact.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Integrate anomaly detection algorithms to identify unexpected changes in data values or patterns. Significant anomalies lower the trust score.
    *   **Consensus Mechanism:** When multiple sources provide the same data, implement a consensus mechanism (e.g., weighted averaging) to establish a more reliable value and trust score.
    *   **Decay Factor:** Implement a decay factor to reduce the trust score over time, reflecting the increasing risk of data becoming stale or inaccurate.
*   **Dynamic Processing Adjustment:**
    *   **Threshold-Based Filtering:** Configure thresholds for the trust score. Data falling below a certain threshold is flagged for review or excluded from processing.
    *   **Weighted Input:**  Adjust the weight of data inputs based on their trust score. Higher-trust data contributes more to the final outcome.
    *   **Alternative Path Selection:**  If a data element's trust score is low, dynamically route processing to an alternative data source or algorithm.
    *   **Confidence Intervals:** Attach confidence intervals to outputs based on the trust scores of the input data.  This provides users with a measure of uncertainty.
*   **Metadata Enrichment:**  Extend the existing metadata to include:
    *   `trustScore`: A numeric value representing the data's reliability.
    *   `provenanceGraphID`: A unique identifier linking the data element to its entry in the provenance graph.
    *   `lastUpdatedTimestamp`: The date and time the data element was last modified.
    *   `sourceReputationScore`: The base trust score assigned to the data source.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /data/{dataID}/trust`:  Returns the trust score and provenance graph ID for a given data element.
    *   `POST /data/{dataID}/updateTrust`: Allows administrators to manually adjust the trust score for a data element.
    *   `GET /provenance/{graphID}`:  Returns the provenance graph for a given data element.

**Pseudocode (Trust Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(dataElement):
  sourceReputationScore = dataElement.sourceReputation
  transformationImpact = 0
  for transformation in dataElement.transformations:
    transformationImpact += transformation.impactScore

  anomalyScore = detectAnomaly(dataElement.value) // Returns a value between 0 and 1 (0 = no anomaly)

  trustScore = sourceReputationScore * (1 - transformationImpact) * (1 - anomalyScore)

  //Apply decay
  timeSinceLastUpdate = currentTime() - dataElement.lastUpdatedTimestamp
  trustScore = trustScore * decayFactor(timeSinceLastUpdate)

  return trustScore
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems primarily focus on version control and data lineage. This approach introduces a dynamic trust score that adapts to changing conditions and provides a more granular measure of data reliability. This allows the system to proactively mitigate risks and make more informed decisions, particularly in environments where data quality is uncertain.
