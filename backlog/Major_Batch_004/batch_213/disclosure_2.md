## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Personalized Echo Profiles

**Core Concept:** Leveraging multi-device audio capture not just for speech clarity, but to *reconstruct* the acoustic environment and create individualized echo profiles for enhanced voice command accuracy and personalized audio experiences.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Distributed Microphone Array:**  A system of at least 3 (scalable to N) independent audio capture devices (similar to the primary/secondary assistant structure in the reference patent). Each device must include:
    *   High-fidelity microphone array (minimum 4 elements per device)
    *   Low-latency wireless communication (WiFi 6E or equivalent)
    *   Dedicated edge processing unit (capable of performing FFT, beamforming, and basic acoustic analysis)
*   **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** Powerful CPU for processing reconstructed acoustic scenes and managing personalized echo profiles. This could be a dedicated server, a high-end smart speaker, or a cloud-based service.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Reconstruction Module:**
    *   **Multi-device Synchronization:** Precise time synchronization across all audio capture devices (NTP or similar protocol).
    *   **Beamforming & Spatial Audio Analysis:** Algorithm to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of sound sources, identify reflections, and map the acoustic environment.  Uses data from all microphone arrays.
    *   **3D Acoustic Map Generation:** Creation of a 3D representation of the room’s acoustics, including material properties (estimated from reflection patterns) and sound source locations.  Output: Point cloud data representing the acoustic landscape.
*   **Personalized Echo Profile Module:**
    *   **User Voiceprint Acquisition:** Record short samples of a user’s voice from various angles and distances.
    *   **Echo Signature Extraction:** Analyze recorded voice samples within the reconstructed acoustic scene to identify the unique “echo signature” associated with the user’s voice in that environment. This signature captures how the user's voice interacts with the room's acoustics.
    *   **Profile Storage & Management:**  Store echo profiles for multiple users, associated with specific locations (e.g., living room, bedroom).
*   **Adaptive Voice Processing Module:**
    *   **Echo Cancellation Enhancement:** Utilizes the user’s personalized echo profile to significantly improve echo cancellation performance. Rather than generic echo cancellation, it targets the *specific* echoes generated by the user's voice in that environment.
    *   **Personalized Voice Enhancement:** Applies subtle audio processing (EQ, compression) based on the user’s voiceprint and the acoustic scene to optimize voice clarity and naturalness.
    *   **Wake Word Detection Refinement:** Adapts wake word detection sensitivity based on the user’s echo profile.  Reduces false positives caused by similar-sounding sounds or echoes.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Calibration Phase:** Initial acoustic scene reconstruction and user voiceprint acquisition.
2.  **Real-time Audio Capture:** Each audio capture device continuously captures audio data.
3.  **Synchronized Data Transmission:** Audio data from all devices is transmitted to the CPU.
4.  **Acoustic Scene Update:** The CPU updates the 3D acoustic map based on the real-time audio data.  Dynamic objects (people moving, doors opening/closing) are detected and integrated into the map.
5.  **Personalized Processing:** The Adaptive Voice Processing Module applies personalized echo cancellation and voice enhancement based on the user's identified echo profile and the current acoustic scene.
6.  **Voice Command Execution:** Processed voice commands are executed.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Voice Processing Module):**

```
function processAudio(audioData, userId, acousticMap) {
  // Load user's echo profile
  echoProfile = loadEchoProfile(userId, acousticMap);

  // Apply personalized echo cancellation
  cleanedAudio = applyPersonalizedEchoCancellation(audioData, echoProfile);

  // Apply personalized voice enhancement
  enhancedAudio = applyPersonalizedVoiceEnhancement(cleanedAudio, echoProfile);

  return enhancedAudio;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Voice Assistants:** More accurate voice recognition and command execution in noisy or reverberant environments.
*   **Personalized Audio Experiences:** Optimized audio playback tailored to the user's voice and listening environment.
*   **Advanced Teleconferencing:**  Clearer communication with reduced echo and noise interference.
*   **Immersive Virtual/Augmented Reality:**  More realistic and spatially accurate audio rendering.
