## Dynamic Reflectance Mapping for Augmented Reality Occlusion

**Concept:** Extend the reflectance calculation beyond simple exposure adjustment to create a real-time, dynamic reflectance map of the scene. This map isn’t just for camera exposure; it’s for convincing augmented reality (AR) occlusion.  AR objects currently struggle to realistically interact with real-world lighting and surfaces. This system aims to solve that.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing RGB Camera (as per patent)
    *   Existing Depth Sensor (as per patent)
    *   Infrared (IR) Light Source (as per patent – utilized for depth sensing)
    *   Computational Unit (high-throughput processor/GPU)
    *   Optional: Polarizing Filter (mounted on RGB camera to reduce glare and improve reflectance readings)
*   **Software/Algorithm:**

    1.  **Reflectance Map Generation:**
        *   Utilize the existing reflectance calculation (as outlined in the patent) as a base. However, *instead* of immediately adjusting exposure, store the calculated reflectance value for each pixel (or small pixel cluster) as part of a dynamic reflectance map.
        *   The map should be a 2D array representing the scene’s reflectance properties. Values range from 0 (completely black/absorbent) to 1 (perfectly reflective).
        *   Temporal Filtering: Implement a temporal filter (e.g., Kalman filter) to smooth the reflectance map over time, reducing flickering and noise. This is crucial for a stable AR experience.
    2.  **AR Occlusion Rendering:**
        *   When rendering AR objects, *sample* the reflectance map at the points where the AR object intersects the real-world scene.
        *   Use the sampled reflectance value as a weighting factor for the AR object’s material properties.
            *   **High Reflectance:** The AR object should appear more transparent or reflective at that point, simulating light passing through or bouncing off the real-world surface.
            *   **Low Reflectance:** The AR object should appear opaque and occlude the real-world surface as expected.
        *   Implement a "soft occlusion" effect. Instead of a hard cut-off between the AR object and the real-world surface, blend the two based on the reflectance value.  This will significantly enhance the realism.
    3.  **Dynamic Update:**
        *   Continuously update the reflectance map in real-time. The refresh rate should be at least 30Hz to maintain a fluid AR experience.
        *   Implement a background process to recalibrate the reflectance map periodically. This will compensate for changes in ambient lighting or surface properties.

*   **Pseudocode (AR Occlusion Rendering):**

```
function renderARObject(arObject, scene) {
    for each vertex in arObject {
        // Project vertex onto the real-world scene using depth sensor data.
        pixelCoordinate = projectVertex(vertex, depthData);

        // Sample the reflectance map at the pixel coordinate.
        reflectanceValue = reflectanceMap[pixelCoordinate.x, pixelCoordinate.y];

        // Adjust material properties based on reflectance.
        arObject.material.transparency = 1 - reflectanceValue;
        arObject.material.reflectivity = reflectanceValue;

        // Render the AR object with adjusted material properties.
        renderVertex(vertex, arObject.material);
    }
}
```

*   **Refinement:** Explore using different wavelengths of light (e.g., near-infrared) to enhance the accuracy of the reflectance measurements. This could also enable the detection of materials with specific spectral signatures.
