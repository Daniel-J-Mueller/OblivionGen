## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Temporal-Spatial Point Clouds

**Concept:** Expand beyond source *location* to full acoustic scene *reconstruction* by generating a temporal-spatial point cloud representing the soundscape.  This isn't just "where" the sound is, but a dynamic 3D representation of *all* detected sounds over time.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Utilize a dense, distributed microphone array (minimum 20 microphones) â€“ potentially leveraging existing IoT device microphone networks as a base. Calibration is critical; a self-calibration routine based on known impulse responses (e.g., brief, loud clicks) is required.  Microphone hardware must support >20kHz sampling rate.
*   **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**
    *   Continuous audio stream from all microphones.
    *   Noise reduction algorithms (spectral subtraction, adaptive filtering).
    *   Beamforming to enhance signal from particular directions.
    *   Synchronize time across all microphones via Network Time Protocol (NTP) or a dedicated hardware synchronization system. Critical for accurate 3D reconstruction.
*   **Feature Extraction:**
    *   Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) applied to each microphone signal.
    *   Extraction of spectral centroid, bandwidth, flatness, and other acoustic features.
    *   Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for sound event classification.
*   **3D Localization & Point Cloud Generation:**
    *   Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) estimation between microphone pairs. Employ Generalized Cross-Correlation (GCC) with Phase Transform (PHAT) weighting for robust TDoA estimation.
    *   Triangulation/Multilateration to estimate 3D location of sound sources.  Kalman filtering to smooth trajectories and reduce noise.
    *   Each detected sound event is represented as a point in 3D space (X, Y, Z coordinates) with associated attributes:
        *   Timestamp
        *   Sound event class (e.g., speech, music, car horn)
        *   Sound intensity (dB)
        *   Spectral features (MFCCs, spectral centroid)
    *   Point cloud data structure: Octree or KD-Tree for efficient spatial querying and rendering.
*   **Temporal Component:**
    *   Maintain a time-stamped history of point cloud data.
    *   Implement a sliding window to limit memory usage.
    *   Visualize the point cloud as a dynamic 3D scene, with points changing color and size based on intensity and time.
*   **Output:**
    *   A dynamic 3D point cloud representing the soundscape.
    *   API for accessing point cloud data (spatial queries, event classification).
    *   Rendering engine for visualizing the 3D scene.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main loop
For Each Time Step:
    For Each Microphone:
        Acquire Audio Data
        Preprocess Audio Data
        Extract Acoustic Features

    For Each Pair of Microphones:
        Calculate TDoA
        Estimate 3D Location of Sound Source

    Create Point Cloud Object
    Add Point to Point Cloud (X, Y, Z, Timestamp, Intensity, Features)

    Render Point Cloud
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced augmented/virtual reality experiences (realistic soundscapes).
*   Security and surveillance (detecting and locating suspicious sounds).
*   Acoustic mapping of environments (creating 3D sound maps).
*   Robotics (sound-based navigation and object recognition).
*   Environmental monitoring (detecting and locating noise pollution).
