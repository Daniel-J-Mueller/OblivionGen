## Temporal Data Weaving for Proactive Anomaly Detection

**Specification:** A system for constructing a multi-resolution temporal ‘weave’ from journal entries, enabling proactive anomaly detection by anticipating data object states *before* they are explicitly committed.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on compacting snapshots of *committed* changes. This expands on that by leveraging the journal to *predict* future states, creating a ‘shadow’ data object which is constantly updated with pending changes.  Deviations between the predicted state and actual committed changes indicate anomalies – potential errors, malicious activity, or systemic failures.

**Components:**

1.  **Journal Listener:** Monitors the journal for new entries, extracting data object IDs and proposed changes.
2.  **Temporal Weaver:**  Maintains a multi-resolution temporal representation (the ‘weave’) for each data object. This is a time-series structure where each level represents a different granularity of change.
    *   **Level 1 (Fine-grained):** Tracks individual changes as proposed in the journal, creating a ‘pending change set’.
    *   **Level 2 (Mid-grained):** Applies pending changes to a ‘shadow’ data object. This shadow object represents the predicted state of the data object if all pending changes are committed.  Changes are applied virtually, maintaining a consistent representation.
    *   **Level 3 (Coarse-grained):**  Periodically snapshots the shadow object, creating a series of historical 'predicted states'. This allows for the detection of longer-term trends and deviations.
3.  **Anomaly Detector:** Compares the actual committed state (derived from committed journal entries) to the predicted state (from the shadow object). 
    *   **Deviation Scoring:** A scoring system assesses the magnitude and nature of the deviation.
    *   **Thresholding:**  Triggers alerts when the deviation score exceeds a pre-defined threshold.
4.  **Adaptive Granularity Control:** Dynamically adjusts the granularity of the temporal weave based on data object volatility and anomaly sensitivity.  More volatile objects receive finer granularity for more precise anomaly detection.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Phase):**

```
FUNCTION DetectAnomaly(committedState, predictedState):

  deviationScore = CalculateDeviation(committedState, predictedState)

  IF deviationScore > anomalyThreshold:
    GenerateAlert(deviationScore, committedState, predictedState)
    RETURN True
  ELSE:
    RETURN False

FUNCTION CalculateDeviation(committedState, predictedState):
  // Implement a deviation calculation metric (e.g., structural similarity index, edit distance, etc.)
  // This function should quantify the difference between the committed and predicted states.
  // Consider the type of data object when choosing the metric.

  deviation =  <metric applied to committedState and predictedState>
  RETURN deviation

```

**Data Structures:**

*   **JournalEntry:** {objectID, sequenceNumber, changeType, changeData}
*   **ShadowObject:** A virtual representation of the data object, updated with pending changes. This doesn’t need to be persisted in the same format as the actual data object.
*   **TemporalWeave:** {objectID: {level1: [JournalEntry], level2: ShadowObject, level3: [Snapshot]}}

**Innovation:** This is distinct from the existing patent by being *proactive* rather than *reactive*.  The goal isn't to compact history, but to *predict* the future and identify issues *before* they manifest as committed errors. This system essentially creates a ‘digital twin’ for each data object, allowing for real-time anomaly detection and preventative action.  The adaptive granularity control further optimizes the system for efficiency and accuracy.
