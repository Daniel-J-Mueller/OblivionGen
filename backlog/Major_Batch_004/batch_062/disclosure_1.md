## Dynamic Aisle Segmentation & Power Allocation

**Concept:** Implement dynamically reconfigurable aisle power distribution, allowing for shifting power capacity *between* aisles based on real-time load analysis and predictive modeling. This moves beyond redundant *supply* and focuses on intelligent *allocation*.

**Specs:**

*   **Modular Busway Segments:** Secondary power busways are constructed from short, independently controllable segments (approx. 5-10ft long). Each segment contains integrated solid-state switches (IGBTs or similar) capable of handling full load current.
*   **Aisle Power Controllers (APCs):** Each aisle has a dedicated APC. The APC monitors total aisle power draw via current transformers on each rack PDU feed. It also receives predictive load data from a central management system (see below).
*   **Central Management System (CMS):**  A software system which collects real-time load data from all APCs, historical usage patterns, and predicted workload increases/decreases (based on application schedules, user activity, etc.). Employs machine learning to forecast power needs.
*   **Communication Network:** High-speed, low-latency communication network (e.g., fiber optic) connecting all APCs to the CMS.
*   **Segment Control Logic:** APCs utilize the CMS-provided data to dynamically configure the segments within their aisle. This allows for:
    *   **Load Balancing:** Shifting power between racks *within* an aisle.
    *   **Aisle Power Shifting:**  Temporarily redirecting unused power from low-demand aisles to high-demand aisles.  Segments at aisle ends are configured as bidirectional switches to facilitate this.
    *   **Predictive Pre-Allocation:** Increasing power availability to aisles *before* predicted spikes, preemptively addressing potential overloads.
*   **Safety Interlocks:** Multi-layered safety system to prevent short circuits and ensure stable operation:
    *   Current limiting on each segment.
    *   Overload protection at both the segment and APC levels.
    *   Physical interlocks to prevent accidental disconnection of segments during operation.
*   **Hot-Swappable Segments:**  Segments are designed for hot-swapping, allowing for maintenance or replacement without disrupting power to other sections.

**Pseudocode (APC logic - simplified):**

```
function update_segment_states():
  current_aisle_load = read_aisle_load()
  predicted_aisle_load = get_predicted_aisle_load_from_CMS()

  if predicted_aisle_load > current_aisle_load:
    request_power_from_CMS(predicted_aisle_load - current_aisle_load)

  available_power = get_available_power_from_CMS()

  for each segment in aisle:
    if segment.load > segment.max_load:
      // Attempt to shift load to neighboring segments
      shift_load_to_neighbor(segment)

    if available_power > 0 and segment.load < segment.max_load:
      // Increase power to segment if capacity available
      increase_power_to_segment(segment)
```

**Novelty:**  While the original patent focuses on redundant *supply*, this design concentrates on *dynamic allocation* of existing power resources. It shifts from a passive system to an active, self-optimizing one. The predictive element, coupled with segment-level control, creates a much more efficient and resilient power infrastructure. It allows for greater density and utilization of power resources within a data center.
