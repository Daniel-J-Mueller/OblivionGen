## Modular, Bio-Integrated Device Mount

**Concept:** A device mount that utilizes a flexible, bio-compatible base layer capable of adhering to non-planar surfaces – including living organisms – via a combination of micro-suction, electrostatic adhesion, and a hydrogel interface. The mount itself isn’t a rigid structure, but a framework for attaching devices using magnetic coupling.

**Specs:**

*   **Base Layer:**
    *   Material: Bio-compatible silicone/hydrogel composite.  Durometer: 20A (Shore Hardness).  Must be sterilizable (Autoclave or Ethylene Oxide compatible).
    *   Dimensions: Customizable, base unit 5cm x 5cm, expandable to 10cm x 10cm via modular segments. Segments connect via micro-locking dovetail joints.
    *   Surface Texture: Micro-pyramid array (50-100um height, 200-500um pitch) for increased surface area and mechanical interlocking.  Array density adjustable per segment.
    *   Adhesion Mechanisms:
        *   Micro-Suction: Internal micro-channels create a negative pressure zone when applied to a surface. Activated via integrated micro-pump (piezoelectric).
        *   Electrostatic Adhesion:  Embedded conductive mesh allows for controlled electrostatic charge application. Voltage range: 0-5kV.
        *   Hydrogel Interface:  A thin layer of pH-sensitive hydrogel conforms to the target surface, maximizing contact and reducing shear stress.
*   **Mount Framework:**
    *   Material: Lightweight carbon fiber reinforced polymer.
    *   Structure: Open lattice design for minimal weight and maximized airflow.
    *   Magnetic Coupling Points: Integrated neodymium magnet arrays (N52 grade) at multiple locations on the framework.  Polarity configurable via onboard microcontroller.
    *   Device Interface: Standardized magnetic receiver plates (various sizes and shapes) for attaching devices.  Receiver plates are replaceable/customizable.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Microcontroller: ARM Cortex-M4 based.
    *   Power Source: Rechargeable LiPo battery (3.7V, 500mAh). Wireless charging compatible.
    *   Communication: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for remote control and data logging.
    *   Sensors:
        *   Pressure sensor:  Monitors adhesion force and provides feedback to the control system.
        *   Temperature sensor:  Monitors device/mount temperature.
        *   IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit): Provides orientation and movement data.

**Operation:**

1.  User selects desired mount configuration and size using a mobile app.
2.  Mount is applied to the target surface.  Micro-pump activates to create suction.
3.  Electrostatic adhesion is engaged to provide additional holding force.
4.  Hydrogel interface conforms to the surface irregularities.
5.  User attaches device to the mount via magnetic receiver plate.
6.  Control system monitors adhesion force, temperature, and orientation.
7.  Data is logged and transmitted via BLE.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Medical Monitoring: Attaching sensors to patients for vital sign monitoring.
*   AR/VR: Securely mounting headsets and trackers.
*   Robotics: Attaching tools and sensors to robots.
*   Biotechnology:  Attaching devices to living organisms for research purposes.
*   Extreme Sports:  Mounting cameras and sensors to athletes/equipment.
