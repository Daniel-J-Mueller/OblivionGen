## Dynamic Complexity Mapping for Per-Object Encoding

**Concept:** Extend the adaptive encoding framework to operate not just on temporal segments (GOPs) but on *individual objects* within frames, dynamically adjusting encoding complexity based on perceptual importance and motion characteristics.

**Specs:**

1.  **Object Segmentation Module:** Integrate a real-time object segmentation model (e.g., Mask R-CNN, YOLACT) into the encoding pipeline. This module identifies and isolates distinct objects within each frame.  Output:  A mask/bounding box for each object, along with a confidence score.

2.  **Perceptual Importance Metric:** Develop a metric to quantify the perceptual importance of each object. Factors include:
    *   **Size:** Larger objects are generally more important.
    *   **Salience:**  Use a salience map algorithm (e.g., Itti-Koch) to assess how much the object draws the viewer's attention.
    *   **Semantic Category:** Prioritize objects belonging to semantically important categories (e.g., faces, people, vehicles).  Use a pre-trained image classification model.
    *   **Focus of Attention:** If eye-tracking data is available during content creation, utilize this to assign higher importance to objects consistently viewed by viewers.

3.  **Motion Vector Analysis:** For each object, compute a dense motion vector field.  Analyze the magnitude and direction of motion.  High motion = higher bit allocation need.

4.  **Dynamic Bit Allocation:**  Based on the perceptual importance metric and motion vector analysis, dynamically adjust the quantization parameter (QP) for each object during encoding.
    *   **High Importance/High Motion:** Lower QP (higher bit rate, better quality).
    *   **Low Importance/Low Motion:** Higher QP (lower bit rate, acceptable quality).

5.  **Encoding Pass Structure:**
    *   **First Pass (Analysis):** Object segmentation, perceptual importance calculation, and motion vector analysis. Generate a ‘bit allocation map’ per frame, specifying the QP for each object.
    *   **Second Pass (Encoding):** Utilize the bit allocation map to encode each object independently, adjusting the QP accordingly.

6.  **Manifest Integration:**  Extend the manifest data to include information about the per-object encoding scheme. This enables the decoder to reconstruct the image with the intended quality levels for each object. The manifest should track a series of QP tables as part of the data structure.

**Pseudocode (Encoding Process):**

```
FOR each frame IN video:
    object_masks, object_confidences = ObjectSegmentation(frame)
    FOR each object IN object_masks:
        IF object_confidences[object] > threshold:
            perceptual_importance = CalculatePerceptualImportance(object)
            motion_vectors = AnalyzeMotion(object)
            qp = CalculateQP(perceptual_importance, motion_vectors)
            EncodeObject(object, qp)
        ELSE:
            EncodeObject(object, default_qp)  //Or skip encoding low confidence objects
    GenerateManifestData(frame, object_qp_values)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Visual Quality:**  Prioritize encoding resources on perceptually important objects, leading to a more visually appealing experience.
*   **Bandwidth Efficiency:**  Reduce bandwidth usage by allocating fewer bits to less important or static elements.
*   **Improved Perceived Resolution:** Increase perceived visual fidelity without actually increasing the overall bitrate.
