## Dynamic Content-Aware Archiving & Re-Synthesis

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple degradation to *re-synthesize* archived content based on user-defined aesthetic profiles and predicted future utility. Instead of just lowering quality, actively *transform* the file.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** "Chrysalis Engine" - Responsible for analyzing, transforming, and archiving content.
*   **Input:** Any file type (image, video, audio, document - metadata extraction critical).
*   **Analysis Phase:**
    *   **Semantic Scene Decomposition:** Utilizing advanced object recognition, scene understanding, and potentially LLM integration to break down content into constituent elements (e.g., "sky", "person", "car", "text").
    *   **Aesthetic Profiling:** User-defined profiles specifying desired aesthetic characteristics (e.g., "vintage film look", "high-contrast black and white", "watercolor painting", "minimalist"). Includes parameter controls: saturation, contrast, grain, color palettes, artistic style transfer strength.
    *   **Utility Prediction:** AI-driven prediction of future access frequency, purpose, and context (e.g., "likely to be used in slideshows", "potential for meme creation", "archival backup").  Trained on user behavior, file metadata, and external trends.
*   **Transformation Phase:**
    *   **Element-Wise Manipulation:**  Apply different transformations to *individual elements* identified in the analysis phase. Example: Reduce detail in background elements while preserving sharpness on faces.  Apply specific filters/effects based on user profile to different elements.
    *   **Content Re-synthesis:**  Based on utility prediction, actively modify content.
        *   For "meme potential" – isolate key objects with alpha channels, generate pre-cropped versions.
        *   For "slideshows" - automatically reframe, adjust aspect ratio.
        *   For "archival" – prioritize metadata preservation, generate multiple lower-resolution versions with varying levels of transformation.
    *   **Procedural Texture/Model Replacement:** For identified objects, replace with procedurally generated alternatives, retaining overall scene structure. (e.g., replace detailed trees with stylized silhouettes).
*   **Archival Storage:**
    *   **Layered Storage:** Store original file, transformed versions, and transformation parameters.
    *   **Adaptive Storage:** Prioritize storage of frequently accessed layers.
    *   **"Snapshot" System:** Allow users to revert to any previous transformation state.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   **Visual Profile Editor:** Intuitive interface for creating and editing aesthetic profiles.
    *   **"Re-Synthesis Preview":** Real-time preview of transformation results.
    *   **"Utility Prediction Panel":** Display predicted access patterns and potential applications.

**Pseudocode (Transformation Phase):**

```
function transformFile(file, profile, prediction) {
  scene = decomposeScene(file);
  for each element in scene {
    if (profile.filter[element.type] != null) {
      applyFilter(element, profile.filter[element.type]);
    }
    if (prediction.memePotential && element.type == "object") {
      createAlphaChannel(element);
      cropElement(element, memeCropPreset);
    }
    if (prediction.slideshowUse) {
      reframing(element, slideshowAspectRatio);
    }
  }
  synthesizeScene(scene);
  saveFile(file, transformedScene);
}
```

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond simple degradation to active, AI-driven content *re-creation* tailored to user preferences and predicted utility.  Focuses on transforming *meaning* alongside quality, not just reducing file size. It's a proactive system, anticipating user needs rather than simply reacting to storage limitations.
