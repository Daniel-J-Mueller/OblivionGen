## Acoustic Mapping & Navigation for Subterranean Robots

**Specification:** Development of a robotic system utilizing modulated acoustic emissions and piezo-electric sensor arrays for autonomous navigation and mapping in subterranean environments – caves, mines, tunnels – where GPS and traditional visual systems are ineffective.

**Components:**

*   **Robotic Platform:** Rugged, tracked or legged robot capable of navigating uneven terrain.
*   **Acoustic Emission Array (Transmitter):**  Multiple (minimum 8) high-frequency piezo-electric transducers strategically mounted on the robot's chassis.  Each transducer capable of emitting a modulated, chirped acoustic signal. Modulations will be based on a pseudo-random noise (PRN) sequence unique to each transducer.
*   **Acoustic Reception Array (Receiver):**  A hemispherical array (minimum 16) of highly sensitive piezo-electric transducers mounted on the robot, facing outwards.  Capable of detecting and differentiating acoustic signals based on time-of-flight (TOF), frequency, and modulation.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance embedded computer responsible for signal processing, mapping, and path planning.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):**  Standard IMU for short-term orientation and velocity estimation, fused with acoustic data for drift correction.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Emission Phase:** The robot initiates a sequence where each transducer in the Emission Array emits a unique, modulated acoustic signal. The modulation (PRN sequence) allows for individual transducer identification at the receiver.
2.  **Reception Phase:** The Reception Array detects the reflected acoustic signals from surrounding surfaces.
3.  **Signal Processing:**
    *   **TOF Calculation:** The time-of-flight for each reflected signal is calculated. This yields distance information.
    *   **Angle of Arrival (AOA) Estimation:**  A phased array algorithm is applied to the signals received by the Reception Array to determine the angle of arrival for each reflection.
    *   **Signal Identification:** The modulation of each reflected signal is analyzed to identify the originating transducer.
    *   **Reflection Filtering:** Identify and filter out spurious reflections (noise, echoes).
4.  **Mapping:** A 3D point cloud map is constructed based on the calculated distances, angles, and originating transducers. The PRN sequence tagging allows the system to differentiate between first-order reflections (direct bounce) and higher-order reflections, improving map accuracy.
5.  **Localization:** The system continuously refines its position within the map by matching current acoustic reflections with the known map data. A Kalman filter will fuse acoustic data with IMU readings.
6.  **Path Planning:** A path planning algorithm (e.g., A\*) generates a safe and efficient path to a desired destination based on the constructed map.

**Pseudocode (Mapping & Localization):**

```
// Initialize Map (Empty Point Cloud)
Map = EmptyPointCloud()

// Loop until Destination Reached
while (DestinationNotReached()) {

    // Emit Acoustic Signals (All Transducers)
    EmitSignals()

    // Receive Acoustic Reflections
    Reflections = ReceiveReflections()

    // Process Reflections
    for each Reflection in Reflections {
        Distance = CalculateDistance(Reflection.TimeOfFlight)
        Angle = CalculateAngleOfArrival(Reflection)
        TransmitterID = DecodeTransmitterID(Reflection.Modulation)
        Point = CreatePoint(Distance, Angle, TransmitterID)
        Map.AddPoint(Point)
    }

    // Localize Robot within Map
    CurrentPosition = Localize(CurrentPosition, Map)

    // Plan Path to Destination
    Path = PlanPath(CurrentPosition, Destination, Map)

    // Move Robot along Path
    MoveRobot(Path)
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Material Identification:** Analyzing the frequency response of reflected signals could potentially identify the material composition of surrounding surfaces.
*   **Multi-Robot Collaboration:** Multiple robots could collaborate to create a more comprehensive map of the environment.
*   **Acoustic Communication:** Modulated acoustic signals could also be used for short-range communication between robots in areas with limited visibility.
