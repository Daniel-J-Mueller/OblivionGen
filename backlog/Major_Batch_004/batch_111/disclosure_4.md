## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System – ‘Proximity Pulse’

**Specification:** A user device integrating proximity sensing with localized haptic feedback to create a dynamic ‘awareness’ system, exceeding simple power reduction.

**Core Concept:** Instead of *reducing* transmit power, the system analyzes proximity data to generate distinct, localized haptic patterns on the device’s surface. These patterns communicate the *nature* of the detected obstruction – size, shape, and even material properties (estimated via sensor fusion).

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Expanded beyond basic proximity. Includes capacitive, inductive, and micro-vibration sensors integrated into the back cover and side bezels. Density: minimum 50 sensors/100mm<sup>2</sup>.
*   **Haptic Actuator Grid:** An array of miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) or piezoelectric transducers embedded beneath the back cover and side bezels, corresponding to the sensor array. Resolution: 1mm spacing.
*   **Sensor Fusion Engine:** Dedicated processing unit to combine data from all sensors. Utilizes machine learning algorithms to estimate object characteristics.
*   **Haptic Pattern Generator:** Software module to translate object characteristics into specific haptic patterns (frequency, amplitude, waveform).
*   **Power Management Integration:** Remaining standard transmission power management.

**Software/Logic:**

1.  **Sensor Data Acquisition:** Continuous monitoring of all sensors.
2.  **Object Characterization:** Sensor fusion engine processes data to estimate object size, shape, material properties (e.g., metallic, organic).
3.  **Haptic Pattern Selection:** Based on estimated object characteristics, the Haptic Pattern Generator selects a corresponding haptic pattern. Example:
    *   Large, flat object: Slow, broad vibration across the back cover.
    *   Small, hard object: Rapid, localized tap.
    *   Hand grip: Pulsating vibration along grip area.
4.  **Haptic Actuation:** The Haptic Pattern Generator sends signals to the Haptic Actuator Grid to produce the selected haptic pattern.
5.  **Adaptive Power Adjustment:** If a prolonged obstruction is detected, *then* transmit power can be reduced *in conjunction* with the haptic feedback.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Pattern Selection):**

```
FUNCTION SelectHapticPattern(objectSize, objectShape, objectMaterial)
  IF objectSize > 100mm^2 THEN
    pattern = "BroadSweep"
  ELSE IF objectSize > 25mm^2 THEN
    pattern = "LocalizedPulse"
  ELSE
    pattern = "GentleTap"
  END IF

  IF objectShape == "Flat" THEN
    pattern = "SweepVariation(pattern)"
  ELSE IF objectShape == "Cylindrical" THEN
    pattern = "RingVariation(pattern)"
  END IF

  IF objectMaterial == "Metallic" THEN
    pattern = "SharpVariation(pattern)"
  ELSE IF objectMaterial == "Organic" THEN
    pattern = "SoftVariation(pattern)"
  END IF

  RETURN pattern
END FUNCTION
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Enhanced Grip Awareness:** Providing subtle haptic feedback when a user’s hand is correctly positioned for optimal grip.
*   **Object Recognition:** Identifying objects obstructing the device (e.g., a wallet, keys) and providing relevant haptic cues.
*   **Immersive Gaming:** Creating localized haptic feedback during gameplay to simulate impacts and textures.
*   **Accessibility:** Assisting visually impaired users by providing haptic cues about the surrounding environment.
*   **Security:** Detecting attempts to obstruct the antenna for signal jamming and alerting the user.
