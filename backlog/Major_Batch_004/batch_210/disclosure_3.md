## Dynamic Task Partitioning via Predictive Resource Allocation

**Specification:** A system for dynamically partitioning a task into sub-tasks and allocating resources *before* task submission, leveraging predictive modeling of resource contention and task characteristics. This differs from the source patent’s reactive approach – initiating replicas *after* job definition.

**Core Concept:** Instead of generating replicas post-definition, pre-emptively divide the task into independent, executable sub-tasks. Allocate these sub-tasks to diverse resource pools *before* the task is fully defined.  This anticipates resource bottlenecks and improves overall throughput.

**Components:**

1.  **Task Profiler:** Analyzes submitted task requests (even partial definitions) to predict computational requirements (CPU, memory, I/O, network) and identify potential sub-task divisions. Utilizes machine learning models trained on historical task data. Output: A task dependency graph outlining sub-tasks & estimated resource needs.

2.  **Resource Predictor:** Monitors the provider network, forecasting resource availability and contention.  Models incorporate time-of-day patterns, historical usage, and ongoing task loads. Output:  A dynamic resource availability map, highlighting suitable resource pools.

3.  **Partitioning & Allocation Engine:**  This is the core logic. It receives the task dependency graph and the resource availability map. It employs a cost-function to determine the optimal partitioning of the task and allocation of sub-tasks to the most suitable resource pools. The cost function considers:
    *   Estimated sub-task execution time.
    *   Network latency between resource pools.
    *   Resource pool cost.
    *   Probability of resource contention (predicted by the Resource Predictor).
    *   Data locality (minimizing data transfer).

4.  **Sub-task Scheduler:** Distributes the sub-tasks to the allocated resources and manages inter-sub-task communication.  Handles failure recovery by re-allocating failed sub-tasks to alternative resources.

**Pseudocode (Partitioning & Allocation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION AllocateTask(taskDefinition)
  dependencyGraph = TaskProfiler(taskDefinition)
  resourceMap = ResourcePredictor()
  
  bestPartitioning = NULL
  minCost = INFINITY

  FOR EACH possiblePartitioning OF dependencyGraph
    cost = 0
    
    FOR EACH subTask IN possiblePartitioning
      bestResourcePool = FindBestResourcePool(subTask, resourceMap) // Based on resource needs and prediction
      cost += CalculateSubtaskCost(subtask, bestResourcePool) // Time, network, cost of resource

    IF cost < minCost
      minCost = cost
      bestPartitioning = possiblePartitioning
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  //Allocate subtasks to the bestResourcePools determined above
  DeploySubtasks(bestPartitioning)
  
  RETURN bestPartitioning
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**

*   **Proactive Allocation:**  Unlike the source patent’s reactive replica generation, this system preemptively divides the task and allocates resources *before* submission.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Leverages predictive analytics for resource contention and task characteristics to optimize allocation.
*   **Dynamic Partitioning:** Adapts task partitioning based on real-time resource availability and contention.
*   **Cost-Optimized Allocation:** Considers multiple factors (time, network, cost) when allocating sub-tasks.
