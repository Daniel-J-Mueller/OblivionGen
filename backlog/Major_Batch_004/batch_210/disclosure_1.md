## Dynamic Content ‘Mood’ Selection via Biofeedback

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Standard client device (smartphone, tablet, smart display) equipped with a readily available biofeedback sensor (heart rate variability (HRV) monitor, galvanic skin response (GSR) sensor - integrated into wearable or device). Server infrastructure for content hosting and mood/state mapping.
*   **Software – Client Side:** App/OS integration layer for biofeedback data acquisition.  Local content caching/display engine. Communication protocol for server interaction.
*   **Software – Server Side:** Biofeedback data processing module.  Mood/State mapping algorithms. Content catalog with metadata tagging related to emotional response (e.g., ‘calming’, ‘energizing’, ‘thought-provoking’).  Content selection/recommendation engine.  Client profile management.

**Innovation Description:**

This system builds upon the concept of server-side content selection by adding real-time biofeedback input to tailor content delivery to the user’s current emotional/physiological state. Instead of relying solely on historical data or pre-defined profiles, the system actively monitors the user’s physiological signals and selects content designed to influence or complement their mood.

**Functional Flow:**

1.  **Biofeedback Acquisition:** The client device continuously (or periodically) acquires biofeedback data (HRV, GSR, etc.).
2.  **State Estimation:**  The client-side software processes the raw biofeedback data and estimates the user’s current state (e.g., ‘stressed’, ‘relaxed’, ‘focused’, ‘bored’). This can employ simple thresholding, machine learning models, or a combination of techniques.
3.  **Server Request:** The client transmits the estimated state (or raw biofeedback data) to the server.
4.  **Content Selection:** The server’s content selection engine uses the received state information to filter and prioritize content from the catalog. Content tagged with attributes that align with the desired emotional outcome is favored.
5.  **Content Delivery:** The server transmits the selected content to the client, which caches it for local display.
6.  **Feedback Loop:** As the user interacts with the content, the system continues to monitor biofeedback signals and refine content selection over time.  The system learns which types of content are most effective at influencing the user’s mood.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side Content Selection):**

```
function selectContent(clientId, clientState) {
    // Retrieve client profile & historical data
    clientProfile = getClientProfile(clientId);

    // Get content catalog
    contentCatalog = getContentCatalog();

    // Filter content based on client state & profile
    filteredContent = contentCatalog.filter(item => {
        // Check if item matches client state
        if (clientState == "stressed" && item.tags.includes("calming")) {
            return true;
        }
        if (clientState == "bored" && item.tags.includes("energizing")) {
            return true;
        }

        //Consider historical preferences
        if (item.tags.includes(clientProfile.preferredTags)) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    });

    // Rank filtered content based on relevance & engagement scores
    rankedContent = rankContent(filteredContent);

    // Select top N content items
    selectedContent = rankedContent.slice(0, N);

    return selectedContent;
}
```

**Potential Content Types:**

*   Short-form videos (e.g., nature scenes, ASMR, uplifting stories)
*   Music playlists tailored to specific moods
*   Guided meditations or breathing exercises
*   Informational articles on stress management or mindfulness
*   Interactive games designed to promote relaxation or focus
*   Visual art with calming or inspiring themes

**Novelty:** This goes beyond profile/history based content delivery. It adapts to *real-time* emotional state, creating a truly personalized and dynamic content experience that aims to actively influence the user’s well-being.
