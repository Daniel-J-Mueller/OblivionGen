## Adaptive API Composition via Predictive Modeling

**Specification:** A system for dynamically composing API chains based on predicted user intent and system load. This builds on the existing API proxy concept by adding a layer of intelligent orchestration.

**Components:**

*   **Intent Prediction Module:** A machine learning model (likely a recurrent neural network or transformer) trained on historical API request data, user profiles (if available), and contextual information (time of day, location, device). This module predicts the *next* API call a user is likely to make, even *before* the user explicitly requests it.
*   **API Graph Database:** A database representing all available APIs (both internal and external) as nodes, and possible API call sequences (chains) as edges.  Edges have associated metadata: latency estimates, cost, security ratings, and success rates.
*   **Load Prediction Module:** A time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) predicting the load on backend systems.  This component monitors API response times, error rates, and resource utilization.
*   **Cost/Benefit Analyzer:** An engine that calculates the estimated cost (latency, resources) and benefit (completeness, accuracy) of different API composition paths.
*   **Dynamic Composition Engine:**  The core component that orchestrates the API chain creation and execution. It receives intent predictions and load predictions, queries the API Graph Database, performs cost/benefit analysis, and selects the optimal API composition path.
*   **Caching Layer:** Leverages existing caching mechanisms but extends them to cache *entire API composition results* rather than individual API responses.

**Workflow:**

1.  The Intent Prediction Module analyzes user behavior and predicts the next likely API request.
2.  The Dynamic Composition Engine queries the API Graph Database to identify potential API chains that fulfill the predicted request.
3.  The Load Prediction Module forecasts the load on backend systems.
4.  The Cost/Benefit Analyzer evaluates each potential API chain, considering both system load and the desired accuracy/completeness.
5.  The Dynamic Composition Engine selects the optimal API chain and executes it.
6.  The results are cached in the Caching Layer.
7.  If a cached result is available for a similar request, it is returned immediately.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Composition Engine):**

```
function ComposeAPIChain(predictedIntent, systemLoad):
  potentialChains = QueryAPIGraph(predictedIntent)
  rankedChains = []
  for chain in potentialChains:
    cost = CalculateChainCost(chain, systemLoad)
    benefit = CalculateChainBenefit(chain, predictedIntent)
    score = benefit - cost  // Or a more sophisticated scoring function
    rankedChains.append((chain, score))

  rankedChains.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True) // Sort by score

  bestChain = rankedChains[0][0]

  cachedResult = CheckCache(bestChain)
  if cachedResult != null:
    return cachedResult
  else:
    result = ExecuteAPIChain(bestChain)
    CacheResult(bestChain, result)
    return result
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simple API proxying by *proactively* composing API chains to anticipate user needs and optimize performance.  It leverages predictive modeling and intelligent orchestration to create a more fluid and efficient user experience. The combination of intent prediction, load prediction, and dynamic composition is key. It isn't just about mapping requests; it's about *orchestrating* them.
