## Adaptive API Request Shadowing & Replay with Synthetic Load

**Concept:** Extend the reporting mode functionality to not just *allow* requests through despite validation failures, but to actively *shadow* and replay those failed requests with synthetic, variable load to proactively identify performance bottlenecks and edge cases *before* they impact real users.

**Specification:**

**1. Shadowing Component:**

*   **Function:** Intercept API requests flagged as invalid during validation (in reporting mode).
*   **Data Capture:** Record *all* request parameters (headers, body, query strings), timestamps, and the originating user/service identifier.  Store this data in a time-series database optimized for replay.
*   **Configuration:** Allow administrators to define “shadowing profiles” based on API endpoint, validation rule triggered, or user group.  Profiles control the intensity of synthetic load generation.

**2. Synthetic Load Generator:**

*   **Function:** Replay shadowed requests with adjustable load parameters.
*   **Load Profiles:** Define profiles specifying:
    *   **RPS (Requests Per Second):**  Base RPS and scaling factor (e.g., ramp up to 10x normal load).
    *   **Concurrency:** Number of concurrent requests to simulate.
    *   **Randomization:** Introduce random variations in request parameters (e.g., slightly alter data values, add minor header variations) to simulate diverse user behavior.
    *   **Geographic Distribution:**  Simulate requests originating from different geographic regions.
*   **Triggering:** Load generation is initiated automatically when a shadowed request is captured.  Admins can also manually trigger load tests on specific captured requests.

**3. Monitoring & Alerting:**

*   **Integration:**  Seamless integration with existing monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog).
*   **Metrics:**  Collect metrics during synthetic load testing, including:
    *   Response time
    *   Error rate
    *   Resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)
    *   Dependency latency
*   **Alerting:** Configure alerts based on predefined thresholds for these metrics.

**4. Replay & Analysis Interface:**

*   **Visualization:**  Graphical interface to view replay results.  Display metrics over time, identify bottlenecks, and compare performance under different load profiles.
*   **Request Inspection:** Ability to inspect individual requests and responses during replay.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Tools to assist in identifying the root cause of performance issues (e.g., tracing, profiling).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Validation Service receives API Request
if (validationFails(request) && reportingModeEnabled()) {
    // Capture Request Details
    requestData = captureRequest(request);

    // Store Request Data in Time-Series Database
    storeRequest(requestData);

    // Trigger Synthetic Load Generation
    generateLoad(requestData, loadProfile);
}

// Synthetic Load Generator Function
function generateLoad(requestData, loadProfile) {
    // For each request in loadProfile
    for (i = 0; i < loadProfile.rps; i++) {
        // Create modified request based on requestData and randomization parameters
        modifiedRequest = createModifiedRequest(requestData, loadProfile.randomization);

        // Send request to backend
        response = sendRequest(modifiedRequest);

        // Record response time and other metrics
        recordMetrics(response);
    }
}
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond passive reporting to *active* problem detection and proactive performance testing.  It anticipates potential issues before they manifest in production by leveraging failed validation events to generate realistic synthetic load. The system doesn’t just identify what *would* have been denied, but how the system *would* have behaved under stress.
