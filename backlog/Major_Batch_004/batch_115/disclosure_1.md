## Dynamic Service Packaging & ‘Skill’ Injection

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply *detecting* device capability to dynamically assemble and inject ‘skills’ – small, executable code packages – onto the device at the point of service request. This allows extending functionality *beyond* what the device natively supports, creating an adaptive, perpetually updatable service layer. Think of it like applets, but far more granular and contextually driven.

**Specs:**

*   **Skill Repository:** A central server hosting a library of pre-compiled ‘skills’. Skills are modular, self-contained, and designed to address specific service requests.  Each skill includes metadata defining:
    *   Required resources (CPU, Memory, Bandwidth)
    *   Supported data types
    *   Dependencies on other skills
    *   Security/sandboxing requirements
    *   Target device architectures
*   **Dynamic Skill Assembler (DSA):** Software component running on the service provider’s infrastructure. The DSA receives the service request & device capability information. It then:
    1.  Analyzes the request.
    2.  Identifies necessary skills from the repository.
    3.  Resolves dependencies.
    4.  Packages the selected skills into a deployable unit.
    5.  Signs the package with a digital signature for verification.
*   **Device Agent (DA):** Lightweight software installed on the device (or integrated into the OS). The DA:
    1.  Receives the skill package from the service provider.
    2.  Verifies the digital signature.
    3.  Allocates resources (sandboxed environment)
    4.  Loads & Executes the skill.
    5.  Handles communication between the skill and the service.
*   **Skill Format:** A container format (e.g., compressed archive) including:
    *   Compiled code (platform-specific bytecode or native executable)
    *   Resource files (images, audio, data)
    *   Manifest file (metadata)
    *   Dependency list
*   **Communication Protocol:** A secure, bidirectional communication channel between the service and the device.  Utilizes a lightweight protocol like Protocol Buffers or FlatBuffers for efficient data transfer.

**Pseudocode (DSA - Skill Assembly Logic):**

```
function assembleSkills(serviceRequest, deviceCapabilities):
    skillList = findSkills(serviceRequest, deviceCapabilities)  // Query skill repository
    dependencyResolver = new DependencyResolver()
    resolvedSkillList = dependencyResolver.resolve(skillList)
    packageBuilder = new PackageBuilder()
    package = packageBuilder.createPackage(resolvedSkillList)
    signer = new DigitalSigner()
    signedPackage = signer.sign(package)
    return signedPackage
```

**Innovation Focus:**  This goes beyond passive capability detection. It transforms devices into dynamically extensible platforms.  Imagine a low-end phone being able to temporarily run advanced image processing algorithms through injected skills, or an older TV receiving a skill enabling seamless integration with a new streaming service. The system adapts to *what you want to do*, not just *what your device can already do*. Skills can also be versioned, allowing for A/B testing and phased rollouts of new features.
