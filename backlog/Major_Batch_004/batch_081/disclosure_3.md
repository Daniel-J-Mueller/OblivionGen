## Dynamic Credential Sharding & Attestation Propagation

**Concept:** Extend the existing attestation and secure credential handling to incorporate dynamic credential sharding, distributing sensitive credential components across multiple instance hosts and requiring collaborative attestation for complete access. This significantly increases security by eliminating single points of failure and introducing a more complex attack surface.

**Specifications:**

**1. Credential Shard Generation:**

*   A central Credential Management Service (CMS) receives the client’s complete credential set.
*   CMS employs a cryptographic splitting algorithm (e.g., Shamir’s Secret Sharing) to divide the credential into *n* shards.
*   Each shard is encrypted with a unique key derived from the instance host’s TPM and stored in an Attestation Repository.
*   Shard assignment is pseudo-random, favoring distribution across geographically diverse and administratively independent instance hosts.
*   The CMS generates a 'Shard Map', detailing which shard is located on which instance host. This Shard Map is itself encrypted using the client’s public key.

**2. Instance Host Attestation Enhancement:**

*   Standard TPM attestation process is extended.
*   Each instance host participating in shard storage must attest *not only* to its own configuration but also to the validity of the *other* instance hosts involved in storing shards for the same credential set.  This is achieved via chained attestation requests. Instance A attests to B, B to C, and so on.
*   Attestation reports include proof of successful cross-attestation.
*   A central Attestation Validator verifies the full chain of attestation and confirms all hosts meet the security criteria *and* have attested to the integrity of their peers.

**3. Compute Instance Credential Reconstruction:**

*   When a compute instance requires access to the credential:
    *   The instance contacts the CMS and provides its TPM attestation.
    *   The CMS verifies the attestation.
    *   The CMS provides the compute instance with the encrypted Shard Map and a list of instance hosts holding the shards.
    *   The compute instance initiates secure connections to each shard-holding instance host.
    *   Each shard-holding host verifies the compute instance’s attestation.
    *   Upon successful verification, each shard-holding host transmits its shard to the compute instance.
    *   The compute instance reconstructs the complete credential using the shards and the cryptographic splitting algorithm.

**4. Security Considerations & Pseudocode:**

*   **Shard Redundancy:**  Implement *k*-redundancy, where *k* > 1, so the credential can be reconstructed even if some shards are unavailable or compromised.
*   **Dynamic Shard Re-sharding:** Periodically re-shard the credential and redistribute the shards to different hosts to limit the exposure of any single host.
*   **Temporary Shard Keys:** Use ephemeral keys for encrypting individual shards, derived from the TPM and valid for a limited time.

```pseudocode
// Compute Instance Credential Request
function requestCredential(instanceID):
  attestationReport = getTPMAttestation(instanceID)
  shardMap = CMS.requestShardMap(instanceID, attestationReport)
  shards = []
  for host in shardMap.hosts:
    shard = host.requestShard(instanceID, attestationReport)
    shards.append(shard)
  credential = reconstructCredential(shards, shardMap.algorithm)
  return credential

// Shard Host Response
function requestShard(instanceID, attestationReport):
  if validateAttestation(attestationReport):
    return encryptedShard
  else:
    return error("Invalid Attestation")

// Attestation Validation
function validateAttestation(attestationReport):
  // Verify signature and TPM details
  // Check against known good configurations
  // Validate cross-attestation chain
  return isValid
```

**Deployment Notes:**

*   Requires modification of the CMS to support shard management and cross-attestation validation.
*   Requires updates to instance host software to handle shard requests and validate attestation reports.
*   Cross-attestation validation can introduce latency, requiring careful optimization.
*   Shard Map encryption with the client’s public key adds an extra layer of confidentiality.
