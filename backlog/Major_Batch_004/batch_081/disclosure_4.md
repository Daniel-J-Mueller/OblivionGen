**Dynamic Scene Reconstruction via Multi-Modal Temporal Alignment**

**Concept:** Expand beyond 2D scene segmentation and navigation to reconstruct a navigable 3D scene *in real-time* from video, leveraging the temporal data and multi-modal features already identified in the patent.  Instead of just associating metadata with segments, create a persistent, evolving 3D model.

**Specs:**

1.  **Input:** Video stream, audio stream, identified objects/actors/metadata (from patentâ€™s methods).
2.  **Core Module: Temporal Feature Graph (TFG):**
    *   Nodes: Represent keyframes (as in the patent) *and* sparse 3D points reconstructed from consecutive frames (see 3D Reconstruction below).
    *   Edges:
        *   Temporal Edges: Connect consecutive keyframes/3D points, weighted by optical flow/frame-to-frame change (higher weight = greater difference).
        *   Semantic Edges: Connect 3D points/keyframes based on shared object/actor identification.  Weight = confidence of object/actor detection.
        *   Auditory Edges: Connect keyframes/3D points based on sound source localization. Weight = confidence of sound localization + correlation of audio features.
3.  **3D Reconstruction:**
    *   Employ Structure from Motion (SfM) and/or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques.
    *   Utilize detected objects/actors as priors for 3D reconstruction (e.g., if a person is detected, assume a human-like shape during reconstruction).
    *   Generate a sparse point cloud representing the scene. Refine with neural radiance fields (NeRF) for denser reconstruction where data allows.
4.  **Temporal Alignment & Consistency:**
    *   Employ a Kalman filter or similar state estimator to track the 3D point cloud over time.
    *   Use the Temporal Feature Graph (TFG) to enforce consistency between frames.  If a 3D point drifts significantly between frames, use the TFG to pull it back towards a more consistent location based on semantic and auditory cues.
5.  **Dynamic Scene Graph (DSG):**
    *   Create a graph representing the reconstructed 3D scene.
    *   Nodes: 3D objects, actors, landmarks.
    *   Edges: Spatial relationships (e.g., "table is near chair"), semantic relationships (e.g., "actor is holding object").
6.  **Navigable Scene Generation:**
    *   Employ pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra) on the DSG to generate navigable paths through the reconstructed 3D scene.
    *   Output: A navigable 3D scene that can be explored from a first-person or third-person perspective.
7.  **Pseudocode (Scene Update Loop):**

```
For each frame:
  Extract features (visual, audio)
  Perform 3D reconstruction (SfM/SLAM)
  Update TFG with new keyframes & 3D points
  Apply Kalman filter to track 3D points
  Enforce temporal consistency using TFG
  Update DSG with changes to scene
  Generate navigable paths
  Render scene
```

**Hardware Requirements:** High-performance GPU for 3D reconstruction & rendering.  Audio processing unit for sound source localization.

**Potential Applications:** Immersive VR/AR experiences, remote telepresence, autonomous navigation, scene understanding for robotics.  Adaptive content creation - a dynamic VR world built off of existing video streams.
