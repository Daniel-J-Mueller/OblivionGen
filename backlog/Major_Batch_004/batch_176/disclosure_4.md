## Dynamic Bus Health Profiling with Transaction Variation

**Concept:** Extend the self-detection mechanism to actively *profile* the health of the internal bus, not just detect hangs. Instead of a single faux transaction, implement a sequence of transactions with varying characteristics to identify subtle degradation or intermittent issues.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** “Bus Health Profiler” (BHP) – a dedicated module within the IC, integrated with the DMA controller.
*   **Transaction Library:** BHP maintains a library of transaction templates. These templates vary in:
    *   **Data Width:** Transactions using different data bus widths (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit)
    *   **Address Range:** Transactions accessing different memory address ranges, testing different physical bus lines.
    *   **Burst Length:** Varying the number of consecutive data transfers in a burst.
    *   **Transaction Type:** Reads, writes, and read-modify-write operations.
*   **Profiling Modes:**
    *   **Baseline Profiling:** Run during initial IC power-up to establish a “healthy” performance profile. This profile is stored in non-volatile memory.
    *   **Periodic Profiling:** Run at regular intervals during normal operation (configurable frequency).
    *   **On-Demand Profiling:** Triggered by external request or internal error detection.
*   **Performance Metrics:** For each transaction, the BHP measures:
    *   **Completion Time:** Time taken to complete the transaction.
    *   **Error Count:** Number of errors detected during the transaction.
    *   **Data Integrity:** Verify the integrity of the data transferred.
*   **Adaptive Testing:** Based on historical performance data and detected anomalies, the BHP can dynamically adjust the transaction sequence. For example, if a specific address range consistently shows errors, the BHP can increase the frequency of tests targeting that range.
*   **Reporting Mechanism:**
    *   **Health Score:**  A numerical score representing the overall health of the bus.
    *   **Detailed Logs:** Comprehensive logs of all transactions, performance metrics, and detected errors.
    *   **Alerting:**  Generate alerts when the health score falls below a threshold or when critical errors are detected.
*   **Integration with External Systems:** Provide an interface for external systems (e.g., server management software) to access the health score, logs, and control the profiling process.

**Pseudocode (BHP Module):**

```
function run_profiling(mode):
  if mode == "Baseline":
    transaction_sequence = generate_baseline_sequence()
    store_as_baseline(transaction_sequence)
  elif mode == "Periodic" or mode == "OnDemand":
    transaction_sequence = generate_current_sequence()

  for transaction in transaction_sequence:
    start_time = get_timestamp()
    error_count, data_valid = execute_transaction(transaction)
    end_time = get_timestamp()

    completion_time = end_time - start_time
    log_transaction_results(transaction, completion_time, error_count, data_valid)

  report_results()

  // Define a comprehensive sequence of transactions with varying characteristics
  // Return a list of transaction templates
  pass

function generate_current_sequence():
  // Generate a sequence of transactions based on historical data and detected anomalies
  // Adapt the sequence to focus on potentially problematic areas
  pass

function execute_transaction(transaction):
  // Initiate the transaction using the DMA controller
  // Monitor for errors during the transaction
  // Verify data integrity
  // Return error count and data validity status
  pass

function calculate_health_score():
  // Analyze the logged transaction results
  // Assign weights to different performance metrics
  // Calculate a numerical health score
  pass

function report_results():
  // Output the health score and detailed logs
  // Generate alerts if necessary
  pass
