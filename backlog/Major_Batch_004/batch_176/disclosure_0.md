## Adaptive Content Stitching with Perceptual Loss Guidance

**Concept:** Extend the split-and-stitch encoding process to incorporate perceptual loss functions during the selection of stitched frames, minimizing perceptible artifacts at stitch points beyond basic buffer management or refresh frame detection. This moves beyond simple technical requirements (buffer, refresh frames) and aims for subjective visual quality.

**Specification:**

1.  **Perceptual Loss Calculation Module:** A module integrated into the frame selection logic. This module will calculate a perceptual loss between the end frame of the first encoded portion and potential stitch frames from the second encoded portion. Perceptual loss will be based on a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., LPIPS, VGG-based perceptual loss) trained to assess visual similarity as perceived by humans.

2.  **Stitch Candidate Evaluation:** When selecting frames for stitching, the system will evaluate multiple stitch candidates from the second encoder's output. Each candidate will be scored based on:
    *   Perceptual Loss: Calculated by the Perceptual Loss Calculation Module. Lower loss indicates higher similarity.
    *   Buffer Requirements: Existing buffer management logic.
    *   Refresh Frame Status: Existing refresh frame detection.
    *   Motion Vector Analysis: Compare motion vectors of the last frame of the first portion and the candidate stitch frame.  Minimize differences to reduce jarring transitions.

3.  **Weighted Scoring Function:** A weighted scoring function will combine the above factors:

    `Score = w1 * (1 / PerceptualLoss) + w2 * BufferScore + w3 * RefreshFrameBonus + w4 * MotionVectorSimilarity`

    Where:

    *   `w1`, `w2`, `w3`, `w4` are adjustable weights to prioritize different factors.  These weights can be adaptive, based on content type (e.g., higher `w1` for visually complex scenes, higher `w2` for low-bandwidth scenarios).
    *   `BufferScore` is a normalized score representing the buffer impact of choosing that frame.
    *   `RefreshFrameBonus` is a bonus score for refresh frames.
    *    `MotionVectorSimilarity` is a score representing the similarity between the motion vectors of the two frames.

4.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** Implement a feedback loop to dynamically adjust the weights (`w1`, `w2`, `w3`, `w4`) based on real-time video analysis and potentially user feedback (if available). This could involve:
    *   Scene Complexity Detection: Analyze the scene complexity (e.g., using edge density, motion activity) and adjust weights accordingly.
    *   Content Classification: Classify the content type (e.g., sports, animation, news) and apply pre-defined weight profiles.

5.  **Pseudocode for Stitch Candidate Selection:**

```
function SelectStitchFrame(first_portion_last_frame, second_portion_candidates):
  scores = []
  for candidate in second_portion_candidates:
    perceptual_loss = CalculatePerceptualLoss(first_portion_last_frame, candidate)
    buffer_score = CalculateBufferScore(candidate)
    refresh_frame_bonus = IsRefreshFrame(candidate)
    motion_vector_similarity = CompareMotionVectors(first_portion_last_frame, candidate)
    score = w1 * (1 / perceptual_loss) + w2 * buffer_score + w3 * refresh_frame_bonus + w4 * motion_vector_similarity
    scores.append((score, candidate))

  # Sort by score in descending order
  sorted_scores = sorted(scores, reverse=True)

  return sorted_scores[0][1] # Return the candidate with the highest score
```

6. **Hardware Acceleration:** Offload perceptual loss calculations and motion vector analysis to dedicated hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) to minimize latency and power consumption.
