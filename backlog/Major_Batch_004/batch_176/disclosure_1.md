## Automated Anomaly Detection & Predictive Scaling for Benchmarking

**System Overview:** A system designed to proactively identify anomalies in benchmarking performance *during* execution and dynamically scale worker resources *before* performance degradation occurs.  This goes beyond simply adjusting worker counts based on saturation; it aims to *predict* saturation based on emerging patterns.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Real-time Performance Monitoring:** Collects granular performance metrics from the target system *and* the worker resources (latency, CPU, memory, network, request rates, error rates).  Crucially, this includes metrics *internal* to the worker resources – not just observed response times.
2.  **Pattern Recognition Engine:**  A hybrid approach using time-series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) *combined* with a lightweight anomaly detection model (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM). This combination allows for both detecting known performance regressions *and* identifying unexpected deviations from the established baseline.
3.  **Predictive Scaling Module:** A machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network – LSTM or GRU) trained on historical benchmarking data (performance metrics, worker counts, request rates) to *predict* future resource needs.  The model outputs a recommended worker count adjustment.
4.  **Dynamic Resource Manager:**  Automates the scaling of worker resources based on the recommendations from the Predictive Scaling Module. This component integrates with cloud provider APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP) or container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes) to provision and de-provision resources.
5. **Feedback Loop:** Continuously updates the Predictive Scaling Module's training data with the results of each benchmarking run, improving prediction accuracy over time.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Scaling Module):**

```python
# Input: Time-series data (performance metrics, worker count, request rate)
# Output: Recommended worker count adjustment (integer)

def predict_worker_count(time_series_data, current_worker_count):

    # 1. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the time-series data
    #    (e.g., rolling averages, standard deviations, rate of change).
    features = extract_features(time_series_data)

    # 2. Prediction: Use the trained RNN model to predict future resource needs.
    predicted_resource_usage = rnn_model.predict(features)

    # 3. Calculate Optimal Worker Count: Based on the predicted resource usage,
    #    calculate the optimal number of workers needed to maintain performance.
    optimal_worker_count = calculate_optimal_workers(predicted_resource_usage)

    # 4. Adjustment Recommendation:  Recommend an adjustment to the current worker count.
    adjustment = optimal_worker_count - current_worker_count

    return adjustment
```
