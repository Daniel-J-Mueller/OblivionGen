## Adaptive Load Generation via Generative AI & Synthetic User Profiles

**Concept:** Augmenting access log-driven load testing with AI-generated synthetic user profiles and dynamically adapting test scenarios based on real-time system behavior. The core idea is to move beyond simply *replaying* traffic and create *realistic* and *evolving* load.

**Specifications:**

**1. Synthetic User Profile Generation:**

*   **Input:** Access logs (as per the patent), demographic data (optional, for richer profiles – e.g., location, device type, common browsing behavior), and a generative AI model (e.g., a large language model fine-tuned on web usage patterns).
*   **Process:**
    *   The AI model analyzes access logs to identify common user ‘journeys’ – sequences of requests representing typical user tasks.
    *   It generates synthetic user profiles, including:
        *   **Behavioral Model:**  A probabilistic model defining the likelihood of a user performing certain actions (e.g., searching for a product, adding to cart, completing a purchase) over time. This is *not* a fixed script, but a dynamic probability distribution.
        *   **Request Templates:**  Parameterized request templates for common actions, allowing for variations in query parameters, data values, and other request characteristics.
        *   **Pacing & Think Time:**  Realistic pacing and ‘think time’ (delays between requests) modeled based on observed user behavior in the access logs.
    *   User profiles are tagged with metadata (e.g., location, device type, demographic data) to enable targeted load generation.

**2. Dynamic Test Scenario Adaptation:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:**  A monitoring system collects metrics from the system under test (SUT) – response times, error rates, resource utilization, etc.
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   A control algorithm analyzes the real-time metrics.
    *   Based on the analysis, it dynamically adjusts the load generation parameters:
        *   **User Profile Mix:**  Shifts the mix of active user profiles to simulate different user segments or traffic patterns. For example, if the system is struggling with a particular type of request, the algorithm can increase the proportion of user profiles that generate that request.
        *   **Load Intensity:**  Ramps up or down the overall load intensity to push the system to its limits or to simulate periods of high or low traffic.
        *   **Request Variations:**  Modifies the request variations within the request templates to introduce new scenarios or to test specific features.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** The control algorithm leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL). The RL agent is rewarded for maintaining system stability and performance while maximizing load. It learns to optimize the load generation parameters over time based on the observed system behavior.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Load Generator Pool:** A cluster of computing nodes responsible for generating the load.
*   **AI Profile Generator:** A dedicated service responsible for generating and managing synthetic user profiles.
*   **Monitoring System:**  Collects real-time metrics from the SUT. (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana)
*   **Control Algorithm:**  Implements the dynamic test scenario adaptation logic and the RL agent.
*   **API Integration:**  The system exposes APIs for controlling the load generation process, configuring user profiles, and monitoring system performance.

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```python
# Initialize RL Agent
agent = RL_Agent(state_space, action_space, reward_function)

while test_running:
    # Observe system state (response times, error rates, resource utilization)
    system_state = monitor.get_system_state()

    # Determine action (adjust load intensity, user profile mix, request variations)
    action = agent.choose_action(system_state)

    # Apply action to load generator pool
    load_generator.apply_action(action)

    # Receive reward based on system performance
    reward = calculate_reward(system_performance)

    # Update RL agent's policy
    agent.update_policy(system_state, action, reward)
```

**Novelty:**  This approach moves beyond simple replay-based load testing by creating *realistic*, *dynamic*, and *adaptive* load.  The use of generative AI and reinforcement learning allows the system to simulate complex user behavior and to optimize the load generation process in real-time. This is *not* just about increasing traffic; it's about simulating *realistic* traffic that pushes the system to its limits in a meaningful way.
