## Dynamic Path Weaving with Predictive Collision Fields

**Concept:** Extend the hash-based path data system to enable real-time, dynamic path adjustments for aerial vehicles based on predicted collision probabilities represented as a "collision field". Instead of solely relying on pre-computed paths or reactive avoidance, vehicles contribute to and utilize a shared, constantly updated field representing risk.

**Specifications:**

**1. Collision Field Generation:**

*   **Data Structure:**  A volumetric grid overlaying the operational airspace. Each cell stores a 'risk score' – a probability of collision within a defined time horizon.
*   **Risk Score Calculation:**
    *   Input: Vehicle path data (obtained via hash lookup), velocity, predicted maneuvers (based on intent signaling – see section 3), sensor data (if available).
    *   Algorithm:  A Bayesian network or similar probabilistic model combining predicted trajectories, historical collision data, and real-time sensor readings. Higher densities of potential conflicts yield higher risk scores.
    *   Update Frequency:  10-20 Hz per vehicle, aggregated at regional controllers.
*   **Regional Aggregation:**  Controllers merge individual vehicle risk contributions into a cohesive regional collision field.  Hash-based lookup enables efficient identification of overlapping paths.

**2. Dynamic Path Weaving Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Current path data (hash lookup), regional collision field, vehicle objectives (destination, speed, energy efficiency).
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Path Sampling:** Generate multiple potential path variations around the current path, each differing slightly in heading, altitude, and speed.
    2.  **Risk Evaluation:**  For each path variation, sample the collision field along the projected trajectory.  Calculate a "path risk score" – the integral of the collision field density along the path.
    3.  **Cost Function:**  Combine path risk score with objective-based costs (distance, energy, time). Use a weighted sum or optimization algorithm to select the path variation with the lowest overall cost.
    4.  **Path Update:** Implement the selected path variation.  Update the vehicle's path data in the data store (along with the new hash value).  Broadcast the updated path to relevant controllers.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Path Weaving):**

```
function weavePath(currentPathHash, collisionField, vehicleObjectives) {
  // 1. Retrieve current path data
  currentPathData = lookupPath(currentPathHash)

  // 2. Generate path variations
  pathVariations = generateVariations(currentPathData, variationCount=5)

  // 3. Evaluate risk for each variation
  for each variation in pathVariations {
    riskScore = calculateRisk(variation, collisionField)
    objectiveCost = calculateObjectiveCost(variation, vehicleObjectives)
    totalCost = weightRisk * riskScore + weightObjective * objectiveCost
    variation.cost = totalCost
  }

  // 4. Select the best variation
  bestVariation = min(variation.cost)

  // 5. Update path data
  newPathHash = hash(bestVariation)
  storePath(newPathHash, bestVariation)
  broadcastPathUpdate(newPathHash, bestVariation)

  return newPathHash
}
```

**3. Intent Signaling & Prediction:**

*   Vehicles broadcast high-level intent (e.g., “loiter,” “approach waypoint,” “emergency landing”) alongside their path data.
*   Controllers use intent signals to refine trajectory predictions and improve the accuracy of the collision field.
*   A simple protocol: `intent: <action>, <parameters>`

**4. Data Store Considerations:**

*   Path data should be stored with timestamp and versioning.
*   Efficient indexing is crucial for fast hash lookups.
*   A distributed database architecture can improve scalability and resilience.

**5.  Controller Hierarchy:**

*   Regional controllers manage collision fields and path weaving within defined airspace volumes.
*   A central controller coordinates regional controllers and ensures airspace-wide consistency.

**Novelty:** Combines hash-based path data with a dynamic, predictive collision field and intent signaling to enable proactive path weaving, surpassing reactive avoidance systems and pre-computed paths.  This system allows for optimized traffic flow and improved safety in complex airspace environments.
