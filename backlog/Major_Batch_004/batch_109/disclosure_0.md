## Autonomous Mobile Vehicle Swarm for Predictive Infrastructure Maintenance

**System Specifications:**

*   **Vehicle Type:** Primarily aerial vehicles (drones) with a subset of ground-based units for localized high-resolution inspection and repair.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution visible light cameras with zoom capabilities.
    *   Thermal imaging cameras.
    *   LiDAR for 3D mapping and structural analysis.
    *   Hyperspectral imaging for material composition analysis (detecting corrosion, stress fractures, etc.).
    *   Acoustic sensors for detecting anomalies like leaks or structural weaknesses (ultrasonic testing).
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, vibration).
*   **Communication:** Utilizes the existing wireless mesh network from the patent, augmented with 5G/6G connectivity for backhaul and remote control. Each AMV operates as a node, dynamically adjusting its communication path.
*   **Power:** Hybrid power system - solar charging (for aerial units) combined with high-density batteries and inductive charging stations (for ground units).
*   **AI Core:** Onboard edge computing with dedicated AI accelerator for real-time data processing and anomaly detection. A central cloud server for aggregation and model retraining.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Predictive Modeling:** A centralized AI system analyzes historical data (weather patterns, usage statistics, maintenance logs, real-time sensor data) to predict potential infrastructure failures (e.g., bridge supports, power lines, pipelines).
2.  **Swarm Deployment:** A swarm of AMVs is dispatched to areas identified as high-risk. Swarm size and composition (aerial/ground units) are dynamically adjusted based on the predicted risk level and terrain.
3.  **Autonomous Inspection:** AMVs autonomously navigate predefined inspection routes using GPS, LiDAR, and computer vision. They collect data using their sensor suite.
4.  **Real-time Anomaly Detection:** Onboard AI analyzes sensor data in real-time to identify anomalies (cracks, corrosion, overheating, leaks). Anomalies are geo-tagged and prioritized based on severity.
5.  **Dynamic Re-routing:** If an anomaly is detected, the swarm dynamically re-routes other AMVs to the location for further investigation and data collection.
6.  **Ground Unit Deployment:** For confirmed anomalies requiring close inspection or minor repairs, a ground unit is dispatched to the location.
7.  **Report Generation:** A comprehensive report, including geo-tagged images, 3D models, and repair recommendations, is generated and sent to maintenance personnel.
8.  **Swarm Reconfiguration:** After completing the inspection, the swarm autonomously returns to base or is reconfigured for other tasks.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function analyze_sensor_data(sensor_data, anomaly_model):
    // Preprocess sensor data (noise filtering, normalization)
    processed_data = preprocess(sensor_data)

    // Run data through anomaly detection model
    anomaly_score = anomaly_model.predict(processed_data)

    // Check if anomaly score exceeds threshold
    if anomaly_score > threshold:
        anomaly_type = determine_anomaly_type(processed_data) // Classify anomaly
        severity = assess_severity(anomaly_type, anomaly_score) // Determine impact
        return anomaly_type, severity, sensor_data
    else:
        return None
```

**Novelty:**

This expands on the patent's AMV network by focusing on *proactive* infrastructure maintenance rather than reactive emergency response. The predictive modeling and autonomous swarm behavior create a system that can identify and address potential failures before they occur, reducing downtime and costs. The combination of aerial and ground units allows for comprehensive inspection and repair capabilities. The system also leverages advanced AI for real-time anomaly detection and classification.
