## Dynamic Geo-Fencing & Swarm Coordination System

**Concept:** Expand the electronic landing marker's functionality beyond a single delivery point to create a localized, dynamic geo-fencing and swarm coordination system for multiple UAVs. This allows for temporary, adjustable “safe zones” and coordinated delivery/operation within a defined area – like a construction site, disaster relief zone, or large event.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Marker Unit:** (Similar base to the existing patent, but upgraded)
    *   Ruggedized, weather-proof enclosure.
    *   High-resolution, sunlight-readable display (minimum 12” diagonal).  Capable of displaying complex graphics & dynamic maps.
    *   Long-range (5km+) LoRaWAN or similar low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) transceiver.  For communication between marker units and UAVs.
    *   GPS/GNSS module with high accuracy (sub-meter).
    *   Microphone & Speaker for voice communication/alerts.
    *   IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) – to detect marker tilt/movement.  Important for accurate positioning in challenging environments.
    *   Expandable sensor suite – provision for adding custom sensors (e.g., air quality, radiation detection) as needed.
    *   High-capacity battery with solar charging option.
    *   Processor: Quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 or equivalent.
    *   Memory: 8GB RAM, 64GB Storage.
*   **UAV Integration:**
    *   Standardized communication protocol (e.g., MAVLink) for seamless integration with a wide range of UAV platforms.
    *   Software Development Kit (SDK) for developers to build custom applications.

**Software Specifications:**

*   **Dynamic Geo-Fence Creation:**
    *   User interface (via companion app or web portal) to define custom geo-fence shapes (polygons, circles, freehand) on a map.
    *   Real-time adjustment of geo-fence boundaries.
    *   Multiple geo-fence layers – allowing for different levels of access/restriction within the same area.
    *   Geo-fence permissions – define which UAVs are authorized to operate within each geo-fence.
*   **UAV Swarm Coordination:**
    *   Task assignment – distribute tasks (e.g., inspection, delivery) to individual UAVs within the swarm.
    *   Collision avoidance – implement algorithms to prevent collisions between UAVs and obstacles.
    *   Path planning – optimize flight paths for efficiency and safety.
    *   Real-time tracking – monitor the location and status of all UAVs in the swarm.
*   **Marker-UAV Communication Protocol:**
    *   Secure, encrypted communication channel.
    *   Bidirectional communication – allowing UAVs to send data (e.g., sensor readings, images) to the marker and vice versa.
    *   Low-latency communication for real-time control and feedback.
*   **Alerting & Notification System:**
    *   Automatic alerts for geo-fence breaches, low battery, or other critical events.
    *   Customizable alert settings (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications).
    *   Voice alerts via the marker’s speaker.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Geo-Fence Breach Detection):**

```
// Within the Marker Unit Software

function checkGeoFenceBreach(UAV_latitude, UAV_longitude):
  for each polygon in geoFences:
    if pointInPolygon(UAV_latitude, UAV_longitude, polygon):
      return FALSE // UAV is within a valid geo-fence
  return TRUE // UAV is outside of all geo-fences - BREACH DETECTED

// Trigger appropriate alert/response when checkGeoFenceBreach returns TRUE
```

**Operational Scenario:**

A construction site utilizes a network of these markers to define safe flight zones for inspection drones. The site manager can dynamically adjust the geo-fences to accommodate changing work areas or hazards.  Drones are assigned tasks (e.g., inspect bridge support #3) and operate autonomously within the designated zones, avoiding obstacles and other drones.  The markers provide real-time status updates and alerts, ensuring a safe and efficient operation.
