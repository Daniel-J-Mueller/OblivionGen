## Dynamic Subject Drift & Predictive Linking

**Concept:** Extend the subject linking beyond static comparison to incorporate *temporal drift* of subjects within a storyline and *predict* potential links based on anticipated subject evolution. This moves beyond simply finding matches to anticipating connections.

**Specifications:**

**1. Subject Drift Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Time-series data representing subject prevalence within a content item (movie scene, book chapter, article section).  This can be derived from keyword density, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or crowd-sourced tagging over time.
*   **Process:**
    *   Calculate the rate of change (derivative) of subject prevalence over time.
    *   Identify ‘drift vectors’ – directions and magnitudes of subject shifts.
    *   Establish a ‘subject momentum’ score – a weighted average of recent drift vectors, indicating the likely future direction of the subject focus.
*   **Output:**  A dynamic subject profile – a vector representing current subject focus, momentum, and anticipated future subject focus.

**2. Predictive Linking Engine:**

*   **Input:** Dynamic subject profiles for two content items.
*   **Process:**
    *   Calculate a ‘linking potential’ score based on:
        *   **Current Subject Overlap:** Similarity of current subject vectors.
        *   **Projected Subject Convergence:**  The degree to which the projected future subject focus of both content items aligns. This is calculated using vector dot product of the projected subject vectors.
        *   **Drift Vector Correlation:**  The degree to which the drift vectors are parallel, suggesting similar thematic development.
        *   **Novelty Bonus:** If a drift vector indicates a *new* subject emerging, increase linking potential as this could indicate an interesting cross-storyline connection.
    *   Maintain a ‘linking confidence’ score that increases with repeated positive correlations over time (e.g., if a predicted link proves valuable based on user interaction).
*   **Output:** Ranked list of potential links between content items, with associated confidence scores.

**3.  User Interface Integration:**

*   **‘Anticipated Connections’ Display:** Present users with a list of ‘Anticipated Connections’—suggested links based on predictive analysis. These are displayed *before* the user explicitly navigates to a linked item.
*   **‘Connection Strength’ Indicator:** Visually represent the linking confidence score.
*   **User Feedback Loop:** Allow users to rate the relevance of anticipated connections. This feedback data is fed back into the predictive model to improve accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Linking Potential Calculation):**

```
function calculateLinkingPotential(subjectProfile1, subjectProfile2):
  currentOverlap = cosineSimilarity(subjectProfile1.currentSubject, subjectProfile2.currentSubject)
  projectedConvergence = dotProduct(subjectProfile1.projectedSubject, subjectProfile2.projectedSubject)
  driftCorrelation = cosineSimilarity(subjectProfile1.driftVector, subjectProfile2.driftVector)

  linkingPotential = (0.4 * currentOverlap) + (0.5 * projectedConvergence) + (0.1 * driftCorrelation)

  return linkingPotential
```

**Novelty:**

This moves beyond simple keyword matching to *anticipate* connections based on thematic development.  It's like recommending a book not based on what you’re *currently* reading, but on where the story is *going*. The dynamic analysis of subject drift and the use of projected subject focus creates a more sophisticated and potentially more valuable linking system.
