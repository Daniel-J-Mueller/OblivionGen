# 9444717

## Automated Anomaly Prediction & Preemptive Resource Allocation

**Specification:** A system designed to predict resource contention *before* it impacts performance, utilizing historical test data and a continuously learning probabilistic model. This moves beyond reactive testing to a proactive, anticipatory infrastructure.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Historical Data Ingestion:** System ingests all test run data generated by the existing framework (patent 9444717). Data includes: settings tested, performance metrics observed, resource utilization (CPU, Memory, Network I/O) during testing, and timestamps.  This data will be stored in a time-series database optimized for fast retrieval and analysis.

2.  **Probabilistic Modeling (Bayesian Network with Time-Series Components):** A Bayesian Network (BN) is constructed. Nodes represent:
    *   Settings (hardware, network, VM type â€“ per patent).
    *   Performance Metrics (response time, throughput, error rate).
    *   Resource Utilization Metrics.
    *   Time-Series components representing historical trends of resource usage.  These time-series components are critical for predicting future needs.

    Edges represent probabilistic dependencies between nodes.  Initial dependencies are informed by expert knowledge, but are *continuously learned* from the historical data.  The BN will model the probability of certain performance outcomes given specific settings and resource utilization.

3.  **Anomaly Detection Engine:** 
    *   A rolling time window is used to establish a "baseline" of expected performance and resource utilization.
    *   The BN predicts expected performance based on current settings and resource utilization.
    *   Any deviation from the predicted baseline (using statistical measures like standard deviation or percentile thresholds) triggers an anomaly alert.  The severity of the alert is based on the magnitude of the deviation.

4.  **Preemptive Resource Allocation Module:**
    *   Upon anomaly detection, the system attempts to preemptively allocate additional resources (e.g., scale up VM instances, increase network bandwidth).
    *   The resource allocation strategy is determined by a reinforcement learning agent that learns which actions are most effective at mitigating anomalies. The agent is trained using historical anomaly data and the corresponding resource allocation actions.

5. **'Shadow Testing' Integration:**  Run a 'shadow' instance of the test population on a representative subset of production hardware. Continuously monitor the shadow instance for anomalies *before* they impact production.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection & Preemptive Allocation):**

```
// Global Variables
time_series_db: Database // Stores historical data
bayesian_network: BayesianNetwork // Probabilistic model
reinforcement_learning_agent: RL Agent // Resource allocation strategy
baseline_window_size: Integer = 30 // Minutes
anomaly_threshold: Float = 2.0 // Standard Deviations

// Function: Detect Anomalies
function detect_anomalies(current_settings, current_resource_usage, current_performance_metrics):
    predicted_performance = bayesian_network.predict(current_settings, current_resource_usage)
    deviation = calculate_deviation(predicted_performance, current_performance_metrics)

    if deviation > anomaly_threshold:
        return True, deviation
    else:
        return False, 0

// Function: Allocate Resources
function allocate_resources(anomaly_severity):
    action = reinforcement_learning_agent.select_action(anomaly_severity) //E.g., scale up VMs
    execute_action(action)
    return

// Main Loop
while True:
    current_settings = get_current_settings()
    current_resource_usage = get_current_resource_usage()
    current_performance_metrics = get_current_performance_metrics()

    anomaly_detected, anomaly_severity = detect_anomalies(current_settings, current_resource_usage, current_performance_metrics)

    if anomaly_detected:
        allocate_resources(anomaly_severity)

    // Update historical data and retrain Bayesian Network periodically
    update_historical_data(current_settings, current_resource_usage, current_performance_metrics)
    retrain_bayesian_network()
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Testing Framework (patent 9444717) generates test data.
2.  Data is ingested into the time-series database.
3.  Bayesian Network is trained and updated using historical data.
4.  Real-time data is fed into the Bayesian Network for prediction.
5.  Anomaly Detection Engine compares predicted vs. actual performance.
6.  Reinforcement Learning Agent determines optimal resource allocation strategy.
7.  Resource allocation is executed.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced downtime.
*   Improved performance.
*   Proactive infrastructure management.
*   Optimized resource utilization.
