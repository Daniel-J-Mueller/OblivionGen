**Personalized Predictive Inventory Adjustment System**

**Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust merchant inventory levels *before* recommendations are even presented, anticipating positive or negative impacts based on predicted recommendation acceptance. This moves beyond reactive implementation tracking to proactive inventory optimization.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Inputs:**
    *   Historical Recommendation Acceptance Rates (per merchant, recommendation type, product category).
    *   Real-time Sales Data (per merchant, product).
    *   Inventory Levels (per merchant, product).
    *   External Data: Social media trends, seasonality, competitor pricing.
    *   Agent Interaction Data: Notes from agent interactions, indicating merchant receptiveness to specific recommendation *types*.
2.  **Prediction Engine:**
    *   Utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on historical data to predict the probability of a merchant accepting a given recommendation.
    *   Considers merchant characteristics (size, industry, performance metrics) as input features.
    *   Incorporates agent interaction data via natural language processing (NLP) to assess merchant sentiment and predict acceptance likelihood.
3.  **Inventory Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   **Formula:** `ΔInventory = (PredictedAcceptanceRate * EstimatedSalesIncrease * SafetyFactor) - (PredictedRejectionRate * EstimatedWasteCost)`
        *   `ΔInventory`: Change in inventory level.
        *   `PredictedAcceptanceRate`: Probability of recommendation acceptance (from Prediction Engine).
        *   `EstimatedSalesIncrease`: Projected sales increase if recommendation is accepted. This will vary by recommendation type.
        *   `SafetyFactor`: A configurable value to account for uncertainty (e.g., 0.1-0.2).
        *   `PredictedRejectionRate`: Probability of recommendation rejection (1 - PredictedAcceptanceRate).
        *   `EstimatedWasteCost`: Cost associated with unsold inventory (holding costs, markdowns).
    *   Algorithm dynamically adjusts inventory levels *before* recommendations are presented to the merchant.  Positive ΔInventory indicates increasing stock, negative indicates decreasing.
4.  **Implementation Details:**
    *   API integration with merchant inventory management systems.
    *   Real-time monitoring dashboard for tracking inventory adjustments and sales performance.
    *   Automated alert system for flagging potential stockouts or overstock situations.
5.  **User Interface (Agent View):**
    *   Visualize predicted inventory adjustments alongside recommendations.
    *   Ability to override automated adjustments (with justification).
    *   Historical performance reports showing the impact of predictive inventory adjustments on sales and profitability.
6. **Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION PredictInventoryAdjustment(merchant_id, recommendation_id):
  // Get historical data
  historical_data = GET_HISTORICAL_DATA(merchant_id, recommendation_id)

  // Train prediction model
  prediction_model = TRAIN_MODEL(historical_data)

  // Predict acceptance rate
  acceptance_rate = PREDICT_ACCEPTANCE_RATE(prediction_model, merchant_id, recommendation_id)

  // Calculate estimated sales increase
  sales_increase = ESTIMATE_SALES_INCREASE(recommendation_id)

  // Calculate estimated waste cost
  waste_cost = ESTIMATE_WASTE_COST()

  // Calculate inventory adjustment
  inventory_adjustment = (acceptance_rate * sales_increase) - ( (1-acceptance_rate) * waste_cost )

  RETURN inventory_adjustment
END FUNCTION
