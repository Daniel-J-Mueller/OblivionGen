## Dynamic Highlight Personalization via Affect Recognition

**Concept:** Extend automated highlight generation beyond viewership metrics to incorporate real-time analysis of viewer *emotional responses* to create highly personalized highlights. This moves beyond simply identifying *what* moments generate activity to understanding *how* those moments are *felt* by individual viewers.

**Specs:**

**I. Affect Recognition Module:**

*   **Input:** Live video stream, real-time audio stream (optional – for vocal affect), webcam feed (for facial expression analysis).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Facial Expression Recognition:  Employ a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze facial expressions (joy, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, neutral) from the webcam feed.
    *   Vocal Affect Analysis:  Utilize a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or similar model trained on labeled vocal affect data to extract emotional cues from the audio stream.
    *   Physiological Signal Integration (Optional):  If viewers utilize wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness trackers), integrate heart rate variability (HRV) and skin conductance data to enhance emotional state assessment.
    *   Data Fusion: Combine data from all sources using a weighted averaging or Bayesian network approach to create a unified ‘Affect Score’ representing the viewer’s emotional state at any given moment.
*   **Output:** Time-series Affect Score (0-1) for each viewer, synchronized with the video stream.

**II. Personalized Highlight Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Video stream, chat activity data, Affect Scores (from Affect Recognition Module), viewer profile data (preferences, viewing history).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Initial Segment Identification: Utilize the existing highlight generation algorithm (from the base patent) to identify candidate highlight segments based on chat activity peaks.
    *   Affect-Based Segment Scoring: For each candidate segment:
        *   Calculate average Affect Score during the segment for each viewer.
        *   Assign a ‘Personalized Relevance Score’ based on:
            *   Average Affect Score magnitude (higher scores = more intense emotional response).
            *   Affect Score consistency (segments where most viewers exhibit similar emotional responses receive higher scores).
            *   Viewer Profile alignment (segments aligned with the viewer’s stated preferences receive higher scores).
    *   Dynamic Adjustment of Segment Boundaries:  Based on the Personalized Relevance Score, adjust the start and end points of the candidate segments.  Specifically:
        *   If high emotional engagement occurs *before* the initial “peak”, extend the segment start point.
        *   If emotional engagement continues *after* the initial “peak”, extend the segment end point.
        *   Utilize a moving average filter to smooth segment boundary adjustments.
    *   Highlight Generation: Create personalized highlights based on the adjusted segment boundaries.

**III. System Architecture:**

*   **Edge Processing:** Affect Recognition Module (facial expression & vocal affect) runs on edge devices (viewer’s computer, mobile device) to minimize latency and bandwidth requirements.
*   **Cloud Processing:** Personalized Highlight Algorithm and segment boundary adjustment run in the cloud to leverage greater computing power and data storage.
*   **API Integration:** Seamless integration with existing streaming platform APIs.

**Pseudocode (Personalized Highlight Generation):**

```
function generatePersonalizedHighlight(videoStream, chatActivity, viewerProfile, affectData):
  candidateSegments = identifyCandidateSegments(videoStream, chatActivity)
  for segment in candidateSegments:
    affectScore = calculateAverageAffectScore(affectData, segment)
    profileAlignmentScore = calculateProfileAlignmentScore(viewerProfile, segment)
    personalizedRelevanceScore = (affectScore * 0.7) + (profileAlignmentScore * 0.3)
    adjustedSegment = adjustSegmentBoundaries(segment, personalizedRelevanceScore)
    personalizedHighlights.append(adjustedSegment)
  return personalizedHighlights
```

**Novelty:** This extends highlight generation beyond merely identifying popular moments (based on activity) to understanding *how* individual viewers *feel* about those moments.  The combination of multi-modal affect recognition, viewer profile alignment, and dynamic segment boundary adjustment provides a significantly more personalized and engaging highlight experience.
