## Dynamic Diagram Complexity Assessment & Remediation

**Specification:** A system for assessing and proactively remediating software design diagrams based on calculated complexity metrics, coupled with AI-driven suggestion of simplification refactorings.

**Core Concept:**  Extend the existing graph-based analysis to *quantify* diagram complexity beyond ambiguity detection.  Introduce a ‘Complexity Score’ tied to cognitive load.  The system should predict potential maintainability issues *before* they become ambiguous flaws.

**Components:**

1.  **Complexity Metric Engine:**
    *   Input: The graph representation of the software design diagram (nodes & edges). Spatial coordinates of elements.
    *   Calculations:
        *   **Node Degree Centrality:** Sum of connections for each node. Higher = more complex.
        *   **Edge Density:** Ratio of existing edges to possible edges. Higher = potentially tangled.
        *   **Cyclomatic Complexity (adapted):**  Calculate complexity based on connected components.  Essentially, how many independent paths exist through the design.
        *   **Spatial Distribution Entropy:** Measure the uniformity of element distribution.  Clustered elements increase complexity. (Utilize spatial coordinates)
        *   **Combined Complexity Score:** Weighted sum of the above metrics. Weights are configurable.
2.  **Predictive Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Complexity Score, historical data from previously analyzed diagrams (maintainability records, bug reports).
    *   Process:  Machine learning model trained to predict future maintainability issues (e.g., high defect density, long resolution times) based on Complexity Score. Output:  Risk assessment (low, medium, high).
3.  **Refactoring Suggestion Engine:**
    *   Input: Graph representation, Complexity Score, Risk Assessment.
    *   Process: AI-powered refactoring suggestions.  Examples:
        *   **Component Splitting:**  Identify highly connected components and suggest splitting them into smaller, more manageable units.
        *   **Relationship Simplification:** Detect complex relationships (e.g., multi-way associations) and suggest alternative, simpler representations.
        *   **Layout Optimization:**  Suggest rearrangements of elements to reduce spatial clustering and improve readability.
        *   **Abstraction Introduction:** Propose new abstraction layers to hide complexity.
    *   Output: Ranked list of refactoring suggestions with estimated impact on Complexity Score and maintainability.
4.  **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   Leverage the existing rules engine.
    *   Add new rules to trigger analysis when a diagram exceeds a defined Complexity Score threshold.
    *   Present refactoring suggestions directly within the user interface.

**Pseudocode (Refactoring Suggestion Engine):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION GenerateRefactoringSuggestions(graph, complexityScore, riskAssessment):
  suggestions = []

  // Component Splitting
  FOR each component IN graph:
    IF component.degree > threshold:
      suggestions.append("Split component " + component.name + " into smaller units.")

  // Relationship Simplification
  FOR each relationship IN graph:
    IF relationship.type == "complex" AND relationship.degree > threshold:
      suggestions.append("Simplify relationship between " + relationship.source + " and " + relationship.target + ".")

  // Layout Optimization
  IF SpatialDistributionEntropy(graph) > threshold:
    suggestions.append("Optimize layout to reduce spatial clustering.")

  // Abstraction Introduction
  IF complexityScore > high_threshold:
    suggestions.append("Introduce abstraction layers to hide complexity.")

  // Rank suggestions based on estimated impact on complexity score & maintainability
  ranked_suggestions = RankSuggestions(suggestions)

  RETURN ranked_suggestions
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Historical data on software design diagrams (graph representations).
*   Maintainability records (defect density, resolution times, code churn).
*   Configuration parameters for Complexity Metric Engine (weights, thresholds).
