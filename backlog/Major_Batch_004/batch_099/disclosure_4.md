## Dynamic Workload Shifting via Predictive Failure Analysis

**Concept:** Instead of *reacting* to failures with workload redistribution, proactively shift workloads *before* a failure occurs, based on predictive analysis of heartbeat data and resource utilization. This system anticipates issues instead of resolving them.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Analysis Module:**

*   **Heartbeat Enhancement:** Heartbeats include not just presence/absence but also resource utilization data (CPU, memory, network I/O) of the sending event processor.
*   **Baseline Establishment:** Each event processor's resource utilization is monitored over a defined period to establish a baseline "healthy" profile.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA) analyzes incoming heartbeat data in real-time, identifying deviations from the established baseline for each event processor.  Deviation is quantified as an ‘Instability Score’.
*   **Predictive Failure Probability:**  The Instability Score is mapped to a Predictive Failure Probability (PFP).  PFP thresholds determine when workload shifting is initiated.

**2. Workload Shifting Manager:**

*   **Workload Partition Awareness:** Maintains a map of workloads and the event processors currently handling them, corresponding to the partitioning scheme in the original patent.
*   **Shifting Trigger:** When the PFP for an event processor exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the Workload Shifting Manager initiates workload transfer.
*   **Dynamic Transfer Selection:** Instead of simply redistributing all workloads, the manager selects *specific* workloads to transfer, prioritizing those that are least disruptive to shift or have the highest potential for impact if the processor fails. This is done using a 'Disruption Score' - calculated based on dependency graphs of the workloads.
*   **Transfer Orchestration:**  The manager communicates with target event processors, initiating the transfer of designated workloads. This utilizes the existing communication infrastructure.

**3.  Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:**

*   **Feedback Loop:** Monitors the success/failure rate of workload shifts.  
*   **Threshold Modification:**  Adjusts PFP thresholds dynamically based on the feedback. If shifts are consistently preemptive and successful, thresholds can be lowered. If shifts are often unnecessary or disruptive, thresholds are raised.
*   **Environmental Awareness:** Considers external factors (e.g., system load, network congestion) when adjusting thresholds.

**Pseudocode (Workload Shifting Manager - Simplified):**

```
function handle_heartbeat(heartbeat_data):
  processor_id = heartbeat_data.processor_id
  resource_utilization = heartbeat_data.resource_utilization
  
  instability_score = calculate_instability_score(processor_id, resource_utilization)
  pfp = map_instability_to_pfp(instability_score)

  if pfp > pfp_threshold:
    workloads_to_shift = select_workloads_for_shift(processor_id)
    for workload in workloads_to_shift:
      target_processor = select_target_processor(workload)
      transfer_workload(workload, processor_id, target_processor)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires increased computational resources for real-time anomaly detection.
*   Model training (for anomaly detection) can be done offline.
*   Integration with existing monitoring and orchestration systems.
*   Secure communication between event processors.
