## Dynamic Narrative Branching via Multi-Armed Bandit Sequencing

**Concept:** Extend the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework beyond simple content selection *within* a page to orchestrate the *sequence* of pages presented to a user, creating a dynamically branching narrative tailored to maximize engagement and desired outcomes. Instead of just optimizing content on each page, we optimize the *path* the user takes through a series of interconnected pages.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A “Narrative MAB” orchestrating a sequence of “Content MABs”.
*   **Narrative MAB:**  This top-level MAB defines the possible *transitions* between pages. Each “arm” represents a possible next page in the sequence.
*   **Content MABs:** Each page has its own associated Content MAB (as in the original patent) responsible for selecting the optimal content *within* that page.
*   **State Vector:** The Narrative MAB maintains a “state vector” representing the user’s progress, inferred interests, and engagement levels.  This vector is updated after each page interaction. Features for the state vector include:
    *   Time spent on page
    *   Scroll depth
    *   Clicks/interactions
    *   Sentiment analysis of user input (if any)
    *   Previous page selections (history)
*   **Reward Function:** The reward function for the Narrative MAB is multi-faceted:
    *   **Immediate Reward:** Based on short-term engagement metrics (time spent, interactions).
    *   **Long-Term Reward:** Based on achieving the overall objective (e.g., completing a task, making a purchase).  This is calculated after the entire sequence is complete.
    *   **Diversity Reward:** A penalty for repeatedly presenting the same pages or content to encourage exploration of the narrative space.
*   **Contextual Bandit Integration:** The Narrative MAB incorporates contextual information about the user (demographics, past behavior) and the current page being viewed.
*   **Sequential Thompson Sampling:** Employ Thompson sampling at *both* the Narrative MAB level and the Content MAB level to balance exploration and exploitation.  The Narrative MAB’s Thompson sampling is informed by the expected reward based on the downstream performance of the selected page’s Content MAB.
*   **Simulation Environment:** A robust simulation environment is required for training and evaluating the Narrative MAB. This environment should allow for defining various user personas, narrative structures, and reward functions.

**Pseudocode (Narrative MAB Update):**

```
// After user interacts with a page:

1.  Update State Vector:
    State Vector = Function(User Interaction, Previous State Vector)

2.  Calculate Immediate Reward:
    Reward_Immediate = Function(User Interaction)

3.  Calculate Expected Long-Term Reward for each possible next page:
    For each Next Page:
        Simulate Content MAB performance on Next Page using State Vector
        Expected_LongTermReward = Average Simulated Reward

4.  Update Narrative MAB arms using Thompson Sampling:
    For each arm (Next Page):
        Sample Beta distribution based on historical win rate and Expected_LongTermReward
        Select arm with highest sample
        Present selected Next Page

5.  Record Interaction and Reward for future training
```

**Novelty:**  While the original patent focuses on content selection *within* a page, this extends the MAB framework to *orchestrate the entire user experience*. It’s a dynamic narrative engine that adapts to the user in real-time, creating a more personalized and engaging journey. This moves beyond simply serving relevant content to actively *guiding* the user towards a desired outcome through a tailored sequence of interactions.
