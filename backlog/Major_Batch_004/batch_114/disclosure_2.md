## Dynamic Contextual Echo

**Concept:** Leverage the shortened title generation system to create a personalized 'echo' of user interaction, subtly reinforcing comprehension and engagement. Instead of *just* providing a shortened title as output, the system will strategically re-present key segments from previous interactions, blended with the current shortened title, as an auditory 'echo'.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure:**  Maintain a 'Context Echo Buffer' (CEB) per user session. The CEB stores a rolling window of the *last N* shortened titles generated for that user, along with associated contextual intent scores (from the patent's 'contextual intent identification protocol').  N is configurable (default = 3).
*   **Echo Generation Logic:**  When a new shortened title is generated:
    1.  Analyze the current contextual intent.
    2.  Search the CEB for entries with the *highest* contextual intent score similarity to the current intent.  Similarity metric: Cosine similarity of intent vectors.
    3.  If a matching entry is found (similarity score > threshold T, e.g., 0.7):
        *   Extract 1-2 key segments from the prior shortened title.  Key segments are determined by TF-IDF weighting *within* that prior title.
        *   Blend these segments with the current shortened title, creating a composite auditory output. The blending could be simple concatenation, or a more sophisticated approach involving prosodic modulation (e.g., slightly lower pitch, increased reverb) to create the 'echo' effect.
        *   The composite output is presented to the user.
    4.  Update the CEB with the current shortened title and contextual intent.
*   **Prosodic Control:**  Implement a prosodic control module to dynamically adjust the pitch, tempo, and reverberation of the 'echo' segments.  This module should be configurable to create varying levels of subtlety.
*   **User Control:** Allow the user to enable/disable the Dynamic Contextual Echo feature, and to adjust the ‘echo’ intensity (subtlety/prominence).
*   **Hardware/Software Integration:** The system should integrate seamlessly with the existing text-to-speech (TTS) engine and audio output pipeline.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generate_dynamic_echo(user_request, current_title, current_intent):

  CEB = get_context_echo_buffer(user_session)

  best_match = find_best_match(CEB, current_intent) // Using cosine similarity

  if best_match != null and best_match.similarity > threshold:

    key_segments = extract_key_segments(best_match.title) // TF-IDF weighting

    composite_title = blend_titles(key_segments, current_title) // Prosodic modulation

    audio_output = synthesize_speech(composite_title)

    update_CEB(current_title, current_intent)

    return audio_output

  else:

    audio_output = synthesize_speech(current_title)

    update_CEB(current_title, current_intent)

    return audio_output
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Usability:**  Subtly reinforces user understanding and reduces cognitive load.
*   **Personalized Experience:** Adapts to user interaction patterns and preferences.
*   **Accessibility:** Provides an additional layer of auditory feedback for visually impaired users.
*   **Branding:** The 'echo' effect could be customized to reflect the brand's identity and sonic signature.
