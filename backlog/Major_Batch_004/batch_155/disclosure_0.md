**Adaptive Authentication Granularity Based on Operation Complexity**

**Concept:** Extend the risk-based authentication system to dynamically adjust authentication duration *not* just on whitelisted/blacklisted operations, but on the *inherent complexity* of the operation itself, independent of categorization.  A simple operation, even if technically "blacklisted" could trigger a shorter, less intrusive authentication challenge, or even none at all, if deemed low-risk based on its complexity.

**Specs:**

1.  **Operation Complexity Scoring Module:**
    *   Input: Operation request details (API calls, parameters, data structures involved).
    *   Process:  Assign a 'Complexity Score' (0-100) based on pre-defined rules and/or a machine learning model. Factors contributing to score:
        *   Number of database queries.
        *   Computational intensity (CPU/memory usage estimated).
        *   Number of external service calls.
        *   Data sensitivity (PII involved, financial data, etc.).
        *   Potential for data modification (read-only vs. write).
    *   Output: Complexity Score (integer).

2.  **Dynamic Authentication Duration Calculator:**
    *   Input: Complexity Score, Operation Category (Whitelist/Blacklist), User Risk Profile (pre-existing assessment of user behavior), Current Session State.
    *   Process: Calculate Authentication Duration using a formula:
        *   `Authentication Duration = Base Duration * Complexity Factor * Risk Modifier`
            *   `Base Duration`:  A default duration, configurable per operation category.
            *   `Complexity Factor = 1 + (Complexity Score / 100)`
            *   `Risk Modifier`: Based on User Risk Profile (e.g., 0.5 for low-risk user, 2.0 for high-risk user).
    *   Output: Authentication Duration (seconds).

3.  **Adaptive Challenge Protocol:**
    *   Input: Authentication Duration, Operation Request.
    *   Process:  Based on the calculated Authentication Duration:
        *   If Duration < 5 seconds: No challenge. Allow operation.
        *   If 5 <= Duration < 30 seconds:  Low-friction challenge (e.g., biometric scan, push notification approval).
        *   If Duration >= 30 seconds: Full multi-factor authentication (e.g., password + OTP).
    *   Output: Operation allowed/denied, Authentication Challenge initiated.

4.  **Feedback Loop & Model Training:**
    *   Collect data on operation success/failure rate, user authentication challenge completion time, and potential fraud events.
    *   Use this data to retrain the Operation Complexity Scoring Module and refine the Dynamic Authentication Duration Calculator, improving accuracy over time.



**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION calculateAuthenticationDuration(operation, user):
  complexityScore = getOperationComplexityScore(operation)
  operationCategory = getOperationCategory(operation)
  userRiskProfile = getUserRiskProfile(user)

  baseDuration = IF operationCategory == "Whitelist" THEN longDuration ELSE shortDuration

  complexityFactor = 1 + (complexityScore / 100)
  riskModifier = lookupRiskModifier(userRiskProfile)

  authenticationDuration = baseDuration * complexityFactor * riskModifier

  RETURN authenticationDuration

FUNCTION handleOperationRequest(operation, user):
  authenticationDuration = calculateAuthenticationDuration(operation, user)

  IF authenticationDuration < 5:
    allowOperation(operation)
    RETURN

  IF authenticationDuration < 30:
    presentLowFrictionChallenge(user)
    IF challengeSuccessful():
      allowOperation(operation)
    ELSE:
      denyOperation(operation)
    RETURN

  presentFullMFAChallenge(user)
  IF challengeSuccessful():
    allowOperation(operation)
  ELSE:
    denyOperation(operation)
  RETURN
