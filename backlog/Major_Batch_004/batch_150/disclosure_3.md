## Personalized Predictive Security Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the existing secure sign-on framework to incorporate predictive security profiling based on user behavior *and* contextual risk assessment. This moves beyond simple verification to proactive threat mitigation.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Profiling Module:**

*   **Behavioral Biometrics:** Continuously monitor user interactions (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scroll speed, app usage patterns, time of day activity, device orientation changes) during sign-on and subsequent authenticated sessions. Store this data as a baseline behavioral profile.
*   **Contextual Data:** Integrate external data sources:
    *   **Geolocation:** Track user location (with consent) and compare it to historical locations. Significant deviations trigger risk alerts.
    *   **Network Information:** Monitor IP address, ISP, and network type (e.g., public Wi-Fi) for anomalies.
    *   **Device Fingerprinting:** Identify and track devices used by the user, flagging unrecognized devices.
    *   **Threat Intelligence Feeds:** Integrate with real-time threat intelligence feeds to identify known malicious IPs or compromised networks.
*   **Risk Scoring Engine:** Assign a risk score based on weighted factors derived from behavioral data, contextual data, and threat intelligence.  The weightings will be tunable and adaptable over time using machine learning.

**2. Predictive Authentication Layer:**

*   **Adaptive Authentication:**
    *   **Low Risk:** Standard sign-on process.
    *   **Medium Risk:** Trigger Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) – SMS, Authenticator App, Biometrics.
    *   **High Risk:**  Block access and/or require a challenge question/security review. Initiate session monitoring and logging.
*   **Behavioral Challenge:**  Introduce subtle behavioral challenges during authentication. For example:
    *   **Keystroke Pattern Verification:**  Present a randomly generated phrase and verify the user’s typing patterns match their baseline.
    *   **Mouse Movement Challenge:**  Require the user to trace a specific path with their mouse cursor.
*   **Dynamic Access Control:** Adjust user permissions and access levels based on real-time risk scores. For example, limit access to sensitive data during high-risk sessions.

**3. Learning & Adaptation Module:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:** Employ machine learning algorithms to identify deviations from the user’s baseline behavior.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Gather user feedback on authentication prompts (e.g., false positives) to refine the risk scoring model.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Regularly retrain the machine learning models to adapt to evolving user behavior and emerging threats.  Utilize federated learning to protect user privacy.

**Pseudocode - Risk Scoring Engine:**

```
function calculateRiskScore(userBehaviorData, contextualData, threatIntelligenceData) {

  riskScore = 0;

  //Behavioral Analysis
  riskScore += userBehaviorData.deviationFromTypingPattern * 0.25;
  riskScore += userBehaviorData.unusualMouseMovement * 0.15;
  riskScore += userBehaviorData.timeOfDayAnomaly * 0.10;

  //Contextual Analysis
  riskScore += contextualData.locationDeviation * 0.20;
  riskScore += contextualData.newDevice * 0.15;
  riskScore += contextualData.publicWifi * 0.10;

  //Threat Intelligence
  riskScore += threatIntelligenceData.maliciousIP * 0.30;
  riskScore += threatIntelligenceData.compromisedNetwork * 0.20;

  return riskScore;
}
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:** Implement robust privacy controls to protect user data.  Ensure compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   **Transparency:** Provide users with clear explanations of how their data is being used and how the security system works.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a large number of users and transactions.
