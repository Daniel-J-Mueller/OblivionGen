## Secure Data "Lifecycles" with Dynamic Manifests & Hardware Roots of Trust

**Concept:** Extend the storage device authentication concept to encompass not just initial transfer authorization, but a continuous, auditable data lifecycle management system. This moves beyond simple "is this device authorized?" to "is this *data* authorized at this *point in time*?".

**Core Idea:** Tie the manifest not to a single transfer, but to a cryptographic "seed" linked to a hardware root of trust *within* the storage device. This creates a dynamic manifest – a manifest that evolves based on predefined rules and authorized events, auditable through the hardware.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Component – Secure Element Integration:**

*   **Requirement:** Integrate a secure element (SE) or Trusted Platform Module (TPM) into the storage device’s controller.
*   **Function:** The SE/TPM stores a unique device key (DK) and is capable of performing asymmetric cryptography (signing/verification).
*   **Lifecycle Management:** The DK must be provisioned securely during manufacturing and remain immutable. A separate, mutable key (MK) will be used for dynamic manifest operations.

**2. Dynamic Manifest Structure:**

*   **Base Manifest:** Initial manifest contains metadata: data owner, intended destination, initial access policies, and a timestamp.
*   **Manifest Chain:** Instead of a single manifest, a chain of manifests is created, each referencing the previous one via a cryptographic hash.
*   **Policy Rules:** Manifests contain policy rules defining data access conditions (time-based, location-based, user-based, event-triggered).  These rules are encoded in a structured language (e.g., JSON with a standardized schema).
*   **Event Triggers:**  Specific events (e.g., data modification, data access attempt, location change of the storage device) trigger the creation of a new manifest in the chain.
*   **Manifest Signing:** Each new manifest is signed using a combination of the DK (device key) and the MK (mutable key).

**3. Data Encryption & Access Control:**

*   **Data Encryption:** Data is encrypted using a Data Encryption Key (DEK).  The DEK itself is encrypted using the current manifest’s public key (derived from the DK and MK).
*   **Access Request Flow:**
    1.  Client requests access to data.
    2.  Storage device receives request.
    3.  Device retrieves the latest manifest in the chain.
    4.  Device verifies the manifest’s signature.
    5.  Device evaluates the policy rules in the manifest.
    6.  If access is authorized, the device decrypts the DEK using the manifest’s private key.
    7.  Client decrypts the data using the now-available DEK.

**4.  Auditing & Revocation:**

*   **Manifest Log:** All manifests in the chain are logged securely (e.g., on a tamper-proof ledger). This provides a complete audit trail of data access and policy changes.
*   **Revocation Mechanism:**  A compromised or outdated manifest can be revoked by creating a new manifest that explicitly invalidates the previous one. The revocation manifest is signed and added to the chain.
*  **Temporal Validity:** Manifests include a validity period to enforce time-based access controls.

**5. Pseudocode – Access Request Flow:**

```
function handleAccessRequest(request):
    manifestChain = getManifestChain() // Retrieve the chain of manifests
    latestManifest = manifestChain.last()

    if verifyManifestSignature(latestManifest) == false:
        return ACCESS_DENIED

    if evaluatePolicyRules(latestManifest, request) == true:
        dek = decrypt(dataEncryptionKey, latestManifest.privateKey)
        return ACCESS_GRANTED
    else:
        return ACCESS_DENIED
```

**Novelty & Potential:**

This system moves beyond static authentication to create a continuously-auditable, policy-driven data lifecycle.  The hardware root of trust ensures the integrity of the manifest chain, preventing unauthorized policy changes.  The dynamic manifest allows for fine-grained access control that adapts to changing conditions and requirements. This is beyond simply verifying a device, and creates a self-governing storage solution.
