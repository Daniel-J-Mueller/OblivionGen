## Adaptive Token Lifespan Based on Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust token lifespans based on real-time behavioral biometric analysis of the user interacting with a service.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Biometric Engine:** Captures and analyzes user interaction data. This includes (but isn't limited to): keystroke dynamics, mouse movement patterns, scrolling speed, touch pressure (on touch devices), application usage patterns, and time of day/week access.
*   **Risk Scoring Module:** Assigns a risk score to each user session based on the analyzed behavioral biometric data. Deviation from the established user baseline increases the risk score.
*   **Token Management Service:** Controls the issuance, renewal, and revocation of security tokens.
*   **Adaptive Lifespan Algorithm:**  Determines token lifespan based on the risk score.

**Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateTokenLifespan(riskScore):
  IF riskScore <= LowRiskThreshold:
    tokenLifespan = LongLifespan // e.g., 30 days
  ELSE IF riskScore <= MediumRiskThreshold:
    tokenLifespan = MediumLifespan // e.g., 7 days
  ELSE:
    tokenLifespan = ShortLifespan // e.g., 1 hour
  ENDIF

  RETURN tokenLifespan
ENDFUNCTION

// Main Function
ON UserAuthenticationSuccess:
  userBaseline = LoadUserBehaviorBaseline(userId)
  currentBehavior = CaptureUserBehavior()
  riskScore = CalculateRiskScore(userBaseline, currentBehavior)
  tokenLifespan = CalculateTokenLifespan(riskScore)
  issueToken(userId, tokenLifespan)

ON TokenRenewalRequest:
  currentBehavior = CaptureUserBehavior()
  riskScore = CalculateRiskScore(userBaseline, currentBehavior)
  tokenLifespan = CalculateTokenLifespan(riskScore)
  renewToken(userId, tokenLifespan)
```

**Data Storage:**

*   **User Behavioral Baseline:** Stores historical behavioral data for each user. (e.g., keystroke dynamics averages, common application usage)
*   **Risk Thresholds:** Configurable values defining the boundaries between low, medium, and high-risk scores.
*   **Token Metadata:** Stores token lifespan, creation/renewal timestamps, and associated user ID.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Initial Baseline Creation:**  When a user first registers, establish a behavioral baseline by collecting data over several sessions.
2.  **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor user interactions and update the risk score in real-time.
3.  **Dynamic Token Renewal:**  When a token is nearing expiration, dynamically adjust the renewal lifespan based on the current risk score.  High-risk sessions receive shorter lifespans, forcing more frequent re-authentication.
4.  **Adaptive Authentication:**  In high-risk scenarios, trigger multi-factor authentication (MFA) challenges even before the token expires.
5.  **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual user behavior that may indicate a compromised account.
6.  **Privacy Considerations:**  Anonymize or pseudonymize behavioral data to protect user privacy. Provide users with control over data collection settings.

**Innovation:** Moves beyond static token lifespans to a system where the tokenâ€™s validity is directly tied to the user's demonstrated behavior.  This allows for increased security without adding friction for legitimate users. This extends the concept of the initial patent beyond simply *reacting* to stolen tokens, and proactively adjusting security based on ongoing user behavior.
