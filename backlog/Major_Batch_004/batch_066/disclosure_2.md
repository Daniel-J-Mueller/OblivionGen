## Dynamic Obstacle Prediction & Path Morphing

**Concept:** Augment the AMD's SLAM with a predictive layer based on observed obstacle *behavior*, not just static geometry.  Instead of simply mapping *what is* blocking the path, the system learns to anticipate *where* obstacles will be, and proactively morphs the path to avoid potential collisions *before* they occur. This goes beyond reactive avoidance; it’s anticipatory navigation.

**Specs:**

*   **Behavioral Data Acquisition:** Integrate a time-series data logger for each identified obstacle. Record position, velocity, acceleration, and any discernible patterns (e.g., cyclical movement, predictable trajectories).  Use sensor fusion (camera, LiDAR, potentially even audio) to improve data accuracy and robustness.
*   **Obstacle Modeling:** Employ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) – specifically LSTMs or GRUs – to model the temporal behavior of each obstacle. The RNN's input will be the time-series data described above. The output will be a predicted trajectory for the obstacle over a defined time horizon (e.g., 3-5 seconds).  Separate models for different obstacle *types* (pedestrians, vehicles, doors opening, etc.).
*   **Dynamic Occupancy Grid:** The existing occupancy grid is augmented with a “probability of occupation” layer, representing the likelihood that a given cell will be occupied *at a future time*, based on the RNN predictions.  The probability decays over time.
*   **Path Morphing Algorithm:**
    *   The path planning algorithm (e.g., A*, RRT) operates on the dynamic occupancy grid.
    *   When a path segment intersects with a cell having a high probability of occupation, the algorithm doesn't simply reroute around the static obstacle.
    *   Instead, it considers the *predicted trajectory* of the obstacle.  The path is “morphed” – subtly adjusted – to create a larger margin of safety, anticipating the obstacle's movement.
    *   Morphing parameters: A ‘comfort buffer’ multiplier for the predicted obstacle size/radius, and a ‘path smoothing’ factor to minimize abrupt changes in direction.
*   **Confidence Threshold:**  Establish a confidence threshold for the RNN predictions. If the confidence is low (e.g., due to insufficient data or noisy sensors), revert to standard reactive avoidance.
*   **Multi-Agent Prediction (Optional):** Extend the system to predict the behavior of *multiple* interacting agents (e.g., a group of pedestrians). This requires modeling the inter-agent relationships and potential for coordinated movement.

**Pseudocode (Path Morphing):**

```
function MorphPath(path, dynamic_occupancy_grid, obstacle_predictions, comfort_buffer, path_smoothing):
  for each segment in path:
    for each cell intersected by segment:
      if cell.probability_of_occupation > threshold:
        predicted_obstacle = obstacle_predictions[cell.obstacle_id]
        predicted_bounding_box = predicted_obstacle.get_predicted_bounding_box()
        expanded_bounding_box = expand_bounding_box(predicted_bounding_box, comfort_buffer)

        if segment intersects expanded_bounding_box:
          // Calculate a small deviation from the segment that avoids the expanded bounding box
          deviation_vector = calculate_deviation_vector(segment, expanded_bounding_box)
          new_segment = morph_segment(segment, deviation_vector, path_smoothing)

          replace segment with new_segment
  return morphed_path
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   GPU for running RNNs in real-time.
*   High-resolution sensors (LiDAR, cameras) for accurate obstacle detection and tracking.
*   Sufficient onboard processing power for sensor fusion, data logging, and path planning.
