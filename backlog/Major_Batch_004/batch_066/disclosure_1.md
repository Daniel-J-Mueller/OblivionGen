## Dynamic Feature Weighting for Per-Region Quantization

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting the weighting of video features used by the machine learning model to predict quantization parameters, tailored to individual regions within a frame.

**Core Innovation:** The existing patent focuses on predicting a *single* quantization parameter per frame, informed by global features. This design extends that by enabling *per-region* quantization parameter prediction, utilizing dynamically weighted features based on local content analysis. This allows for finer-grained quality control, potentially increasing perceived quality and reducing bandwidth usage.

**System Components:**

1.  **Region Segmentation Module:** Divides each video frame into a grid of regions (e.g., 16x16, 32x32 pixel blocks). Alternative segmentation algorithms could be employed (e.g., semantic segmentation) to define regions based on content (objects, backgrounds).
2.  **Feature Extraction Module:** Extracts a suite of features from *each* region. These include, but are not limited to:
    *   Spatial complexity (e.g., variance, edge density)
    *   Temporal complexity (motion vector variance within the region)
    *   Color information (average color, color variance)
    *   Texture analysis (using filters like Gabor filters)
3.  **Dynamic Weighting Network (DWN):** A separate, lightweight neural network trained to determine optimal weights for the features *specific to each region*.
    *   **Input:** Extracted features from a region.
    *   **Output:** A vector of weights, one for each feature.
    *   **Training Data:**  Generated by evaluating multiple encodings of representative video content, where a reward function favors regions with higher perceived quality (potentially utilizing human feedback or advanced quality metrics like VMAF).
4.  **Quantization Parameter Prediction Model (QPPM):** The original machine learning model from the patent, but modified to accept weighted features as input.
    *   **Input:** Weighted features (output from DWN) and the target quality level.
    *   **Output:** Predicted quantization parameter for the region.
5.  **Encoding Module:** Applies the per-region quantization parameters during video encoding.

**Pseudocode:**

```
For each frame in video:
    Divide frame into regions
    For each region:
        Extract features from region
        Calculate weighted features using Dynamic Weighting Network (DWN)
            weighted_features = DWN(features)
        Predict quantization parameter using QPPM
            qp = QPPM(weighted_features, quality_level)
        Apply qp to the region during encoding
    Encode frame with per-region quantization parameters
```

**Training Procedure:**

1.  **DWN Training:** Train the DWN using a reinforcement learning approach. The reward function should correlate with perceived visual quality (e.g., VMAF score, human ratings).
2.  **QPPM Fine-tuning:** Fine-tune the original QPPM using data generated with the trained DWN. This ensures the QPPM can effectively utilize the dynamically weighted features.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Perceived Quality:** By allocating more bits to visually important regions, the system can enhance the overall viewing experience.
*   **Bandwidth Optimization:** By allocating fewer bits to less important regions, the system can reduce bandwidth consumption without significantly impacting perceived quality.
*   **Adaptive Streaming:** The per-region quantization parameters could be used to inform adaptive streaming algorithms, delivering optimal video quality based on network conditions and device capabilities.
*   **Content-Aware Encoding:** The system can adapt to different types of video content (e.g., action, animation, documentary) by learning optimal feature weights for each content type.
