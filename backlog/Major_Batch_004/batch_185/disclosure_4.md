## Dynamic Inventory Holder Morphing

**Concept:** Expand the existing inventory holder concept to include dynamic, reconfigurable internal spaces. This addresses variable item sizes and optimizes space utilization beyond simple density calculations.

**Specs:**

*   **Holder Construction:** Modular, honeycomb-like internal structure composed of lightweight, high-strength polymer or composite material. Individual cells within the honeycomb are independently addressable.
*   **Cell Actuation:** Each cell contains a miniature linear actuator (piezoelectric or micro-servo). These actuators allow the cell to expand or contract its volume.
*   **Sensing:** Each cell incorporates a proximity/pressure sensor to detect the presence and size of an item within it.
*   **Control System:** A localized microcontroller within each inventory holder manages cell actuation based on sensor data and instructions from the central management module.
*   **Communication:** Wireless communication (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy) between the holder’s microcontroller and the central system.
*   **Power:** Wireless power transfer (inductive charging) or integrated, rechargeable battery.
*   **Morphing Profiles:** Pre-defined “morphing profiles” optimized for common item categories (e.g., small parts, long items, fragile goods).  The system can also *learn* optimal profiles based on item characteristics.

**Operation:**

1.  When an item is presented for storage, the system scans its dimensions using a vision system or other sensor.
2.  The central management module determines the most appropriate morphing profile.
3.  Instructions are sent to the inventory holder’s microcontroller.
4.  The microcontroller actuates the appropriate cells to create a custom-fit cavity for the item.
5.  The holder’s sensors verify correct accommodation.
6.  The mobile drive unit (ground or overhead) stores the holder at the designated location.
7.  Retrieval reverses the process.

**Pseudocode (Holder Microcontroller):**

```
FUNCTION receive_storage_request(item_dimensions, storage_location)
    target_profile = lookup_profile(item_dimensions) // or learn new profile
    FOR each cell in cell_array
        cell.set_target_volume(target_profile[cell.id])
        WHILE cell.current_volume != cell.target_volume
            cell.actuate()
            cell.update_volume()
        ENDWHILE
    ENDFOR
    report_status("Storage complete")
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION receive_retrieval_request()
    FOR each cell in cell_array
        cell.set_target_volume(default_volume)
    ENDFOR
    report_status("Retrieval complete")
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION update_volume()
    current_volume = calculate_volume()
    RETURN current_volume
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION calculate_volume()
    // Calculation based on linear actuator position and cell dimensions
    // ...
    RETURN volume
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply optimizing storage *location* based on access frequency. It dynamically optimizes storage *space* itself, accommodating diverse item shapes and maximizing storage density at the holder level, before the mobile drive unit even comes into play. This could substantially reduce wasted space in high-volume warehouses.
