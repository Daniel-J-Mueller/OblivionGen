## Dynamic Code Mutation & Behavioral Cloning for Automated Bug Hunting

**Concept:** Leverage the existing feedback acquisition system not just for *understanding* user experience, but for *actively mutating* the application code during runtime on client devices, observing the resulting behavior, and using that data to train a behavioral cloning model. This moves beyond simple feedback on existing functionality to automated, exploratory bug hunting.

**Specs:**

**1. Code Mutation Engine:**

*   **Module:** `RuntimeMutationEngine`
*   **Functionality:**  Responsible for generating and applying code mutations to the running application.  Mutations should be context-aware, guided by the "modification hints" already present in the source code (as described in the provided patent).
*   **Mutation Types:**
    *   **Value Mutation:**  Modify input values to functions (e.g., changing a numerical threshold, altering a string).
    *   **Control Flow Mutation:** Inject conditional statements, alter loop conditions, or introduce early returns.
    *   **API Call Mutation:**  Substitute one API call with a similar one, or introduce latency/errors to API calls.
*   **Mutation Rate:**  Dynamically adjustable per client device based on resource availability and testing progress.
*   **Safety Mechanisms:**  Implement sandboxing and rollback mechanisms to prevent crashes and data corruption.

**2. Behavioral Cloning Model:**

*   **Model Type:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells.
*   **Training Data:**  Captured application state (memory, CPU usage, network activity) paired with user input/actions, *and* the resulting application behavior (e.g., crashes, errors, performance drops).
*   **Training Process:**  Model is continuously trained on data collected from multiple client devices.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Model learns the “normal” application behavior.  Deviations from this normal behavior are flagged as potential bugs.

**3. Feedback Integration & Orchestration:**

*   **Modified UI Prompts:**  Expand the existing feedback prompts to include questions about unexpected application behavior ("Did you notice anything unusual?") or solicit detailed reproduction steps for observed bugs.
*   **Data Pipeline:** Integrate data from the Code Mutation Engine (mutation details, application state), Behavioral Cloning Model (anomaly scores), and UI feedback into a central data repository.
*   **Automated Bug Reporting:**  When the Behavioral Cloning Model detects a significant anomaly and user feedback confirms the issue, automatically generate a detailed bug report (including reproduction steps, stack traces, and mutation details).

**Pseudocode (Mutation Engine):**

```pseudocode
function applyMutation(originalCode, modificationHint, mutationType) {
  // Extract relevant code segment based on modificationHint
  codeSegment = extractCodeSegment(originalCode, modificationHint)

  // Generate mutated code based on mutationType
  if (mutationType == "Value") {
    mutatedCode = mutateValue(codeSegment)
  } else if (mutationType == "ControlFlow") {
    mutatedCode = mutateControlFlow(codeSegment)
  } else if (mutationType == "API Call") {
    mutatedCode = mutateAPICall(codeSegment)
  }

  // Replace original code segment with mutated code segment
  mutatedCode = replaceCodeSegment(originalCode, codeSegment, mutatedCode)

  return mutatedCode
}

function extractCodeSegment(code, hint) {
  // Logic to locate the code segment based on the modificationHint
  // (e.g., line number, function name, variable name)
  // Return the code segment as a string
}

// Implement mutateValue, mutateControlFlow, mutateAPICall
// based on desired mutation strategies
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond passive feedback gathering to *active* bug discovery. By dynamically mutating the code and leveraging machine learning to identify anomalies, this system can automate a significant portion of the testing process and uncover previously unknown bugs. The existing “modification hints” provide a valuable starting point for targeted mutations, making the process more efficient and effective. This architecture shifts the focus from *what* the user experiences to *what the application can do* under controlled, mutated conditions.
