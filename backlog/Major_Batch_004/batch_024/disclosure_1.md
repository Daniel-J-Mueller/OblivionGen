## Adaptive Partition Migration with Predictive Quorum Adjustment

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A "Partition Health Monitor" (PHM) integrated into each computing node.
*   **Data Input:** Continuous monitoring of partition read/write latency, error rates, CPU utilization of serving node, network bandwidth to node, and replica sync status.
*   **Prediction Engine:** A time-series forecasting model (LSTM preferred) trained on historical partition health data to predict potential performance degradation or failure within a configurable time window (e.g., 5-15 minutes).
*   **Quorum Adjustment Module:** Dynamically adjusts the required quorum size for write operations *before* a node failure is detected, based on predicted partition health. Lower quorum requirements during predicted instability, higher during stability.
*   **Migration Trigger:** When the Prediction Engine exceeds a pre-defined threshold indicating high probability of performance degradation or failure, a controlled partition migration is initiated.
*   **Migration Strategy:** Prioritize migration to nodes with lowest current load and highest available bandwidth. Utilize a staged approach – incremental data transfer rather than full replication.
*   **Metadata Management:** A global metadata store tracking partition locations, health scores, and migration status.

**Innovation Description:**

The existing patent focuses on maintaining quorum during failures. This system *predicts* failures and proactively adjusts quorum requirements *before* they occur, coupled with proactive migration. The goal is to minimize write latency and maintain data consistency during periods of instability.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On each computing node:
loop:
    healthData = collectPartitionHealthData()
    predictedHealth = predictPartitionHealth(healthData)

    if predictedHealth.risk > threshold:
        migrationTriggered = initiatePartitionMigration(partitionId)
        //Reduce quorum size for the failing partition:
        adjustQuorumSize(partitionId, reducedSize)
    else:
        adjustQuorumSize(partitionId, standardSize)

//Quorum adjustment:
function adjustQuorumSize(partitionId, size):
    updateMetadataStore(partitionId, quorumSize = size)

//Migration:
function initiatePartitionMigration(partitionId):
    targetNode = selectTargetNode(partitionId)
    startIncrementalDataTransfer(partitionId, targetNode)
    updateMetadataStore(partitionId, newLocation = targetNode)
```

**Detailed Specifications:**

1.  **Partition Health Metrics:** CPU load (%), memory usage (%), disk I/O (MB/s), network latency (ms), error rate (%), read/write latency (ms).
2.  **Prediction Model:** LSTM network trained on historical health metrics. Consider incorporating external factors like system-wide load or known maintenance windows.
3.  **Quorum Adjustment Algorithm:** A dynamic algorithm that calculates the optimal quorum size based on predicted health scores. Higher scores = lower quorum. Implement hysteresis to prevent frequent adjustments.
4.  **Migration Protocol:** Utilize a consistent hashing scheme to distribute partitions. Employ a staged migration approach – incrementally transfer data and metadata.
5.  **Metadata Store:** A highly available and consistent key-value store (e.g., etcd, Consul) to track partition locations, health scores, and migration status.
6.  **Failure Handling:** Implement robust failure handling mechanisms for the prediction engine, migration protocol, and metadata store.

This system anticipates problems instead of merely reacting to them. The predictive quorum adjustment is a key innovation, allowing the system to maintain availability and performance even in the face of predicted instability.
