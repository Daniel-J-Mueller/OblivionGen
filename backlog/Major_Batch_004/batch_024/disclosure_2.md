## Adaptive Morphology Conveyor

**Concept:** A conveyor system incorporating dynamically reconfigurable modules to alter the conveying surface geometry *during* operation. This allows for complex sorting, manipulation, and even temporary "holding" of objects without halting the conveyor flow. 

**Specifications:**

*   **Modular Conveyor Segments:** The conveyor belt is constructed from a series of interconnected, independently controllable modules (let's call them "cells"). Each cell is approximately 10cm x 10cm x 5cm.
*   **Actuation:** Each cell contains four micro-linear actuators. These actuators allow each cell to:
    *   Raise/lower its surface by ±2.5cm.
    *   Tilt in any direction by ±15 degrees.
    *   Slightly extend/retract (0-1cm) to create minor surface variations.
*   **Surface Material:** The top surface of each cell is a smooth, durable polymer with a high coefficient of friction. Embedded within the polymer are micro-LEDs for visual feedback/status indication.
*   **Control System:** A central control unit receives object identification (via machine vision) and calculates the required cell configurations.
*   **Communication:** Each cell communicates wirelessly with the central control unit, receiving configuration commands and reporting its status.
*   **Power:** Cells are powered via inductive charging built into the conveyor frame.
*   **Software/Pseudocode:**

    ```
    // Object Detection & Configuration Calculation
    function calculateCellConfiguration(objectID, objectDimensions, objectDestination) {
        // Access object profile data (shape, weight, fragility)
        objectData = getObjectData(objectID);

        // Determine desired manipulation (sorting, orientation, etc.)
        manipulationType = determineManipulation(objectData, objectDestination);

        // Create a 3D map of cell configurations
        cellMap = createCellMap();

        // Apply manipulation logic to the cell map
        if (manipulationType == "SORT") {
            // Raise cells to create a "lane" guiding the object
            for (i = 0; i < laneWidth; i++) {
                cellMap[i].height = 1.5cm;
            }
        } else if (manipulationType == "ROTATE") {
            // Tilt cells to gently rotate the object
            for (i = 0; i < numCells; i++) {
                cellMap[i].tiltAngle = calculateTiltAngle(i);
            }
        }
        // Return the cell configuration map
        return cellMap;
    }

    // Cell Configuration Update
    function updateCellConfigurations(cellMap) {
        for each cell in cellMap {
            sendConfigurationCommand(cell.id, cell.height, cell.tiltAngle);
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Flat Mode:** All cells are aligned, creating a standard conveyor surface.
    *   **Sorting Mode:** Cells raise/lower to create diverging paths for different objects.
    *   **Orientation Mode:** Cells tilt to gently rotate objects into the desired orientation.
    *   **Holding Mode:** Cells create temporary "wells" to hold objects for short periods.

*   **Potential Applications:** Complex sorting systems, assembly lines, automated packaging, robotic workcells.
