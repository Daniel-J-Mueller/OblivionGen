**Adaptive Stylometry for Author Authentication & Profiling**

**Core Concept:** Expand the 'shape descriptor' concept beyond identifying machine-generated text to a system capable of dynamically profiling *human* authors based on stylistic fingerprints, and detecting subtle changes in style indicative of compromised accounts or ghostwriting.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Dynamic Stylometric Database:** Construct a database not solely of 'machine' vs. 'human' but of nuanced stylistic profiles. These profiles will be represented as high-dimensional vectors capturing frequency distributions of:
    *   N-gram frequencies (as in the original patent).
    *   Sentence length variations (mean, standard deviation, skewness).
    *   Vocabulary richness (lexical density, type-token ratio).
    *   Syntactic complexity (average parse tree depth, frequency of passive voice).
    *   Pronoun usage patterns (first-person, second-person, etc.).
    *   Emotion/Sentiment Lexicon Usage (frequency of words from emotion lexicons).
2.  **Authorial 'Drift' Detection:** Implement an algorithm to track changes in an authorâ€™s stylistic profile over time. This is crucial for identifying:
    *   Compromised accounts (a sudden shift in style).
    *   Ghostwriting (consistent divergence from established style).
    *   Early signs of cognitive decline (subtle, gradual shifts).
3.  **Stylometric Feature Weighting:**  Instead of treating all stylometric features equally, use a machine learning model (e.g., a Bayesian network or a neural network) to learn which features are most discriminative for a given author or writing task. This allows the system to adapt to different genres, topics, and writing styles.
4.  **Real-Time Style Analysis Pipeline:**
    *   **Input:** Stream of text (e.g., from social media, email, or a document).
    *   **Preprocessing:** Tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, parsing.
    *   **Feature Extraction:** Calculate stylometric features.
    *   **Style Vector Generation:** Create a high-dimensional style vector.
    *   **Comparison:** Compare the style vector to known author profiles (using cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or other metrics).
    *   **Output:**  Confidence score indicating the likelihood that the text was written by a specific author, a detection flag for style anomalies, and a visualization of the stylistic features.

**Pseudocode for Drift Detection:**

```
function detect_style_drift(current_style_vector, historical_style_vectors, threshold):
    // Calculate the mean and standard deviation of historical style vectors
    mean_historical = calculate_mean(historical_style_vectors)
    std_dev_historical = calculate_standard_deviation(historical_style_vectors)

    // Calculate the distance between the current style vector and the historical mean
    distance = calculate_distance(current_style_vector, mean_historical)

    // Calculate a drift score based on the distance and the standard deviation
    drift_score = distance / std_dev_historical

    // If the drift score exceeds the threshold, flag a style anomaly
    if drift_score > threshold:
        return "STYLE_ANOMALY_DETECTED"
    else:
        return "NO_ANOMALY"
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance computing cluster for training and deploying the machine learning models.
*   Large storage capacity for storing the stylometric database and historical data.
*   Natural language processing libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy).
*   Machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Database management system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
