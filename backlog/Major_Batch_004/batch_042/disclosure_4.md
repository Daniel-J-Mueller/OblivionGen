## Dynamic Software ‘Shadowing’ and Predictive Licensing

**Concept:** Expand beyond static software asset tracking to implement ‘shadowing’ – actively monitoring *intended* software usage based on user behavior and proactively adjusting licensing. This addresses the gap between what software is installed and what is *actually* being used, optimizing costs and resource allocation *before* audit periods.

**Specs:**

*   **Agent Deployment:** Extend the existing computer system agent (Claim 8) to include behavioral monitoring. This is *not* keylogging, but rather analysis of application launch patterns, duration of use, resource consumption (CPU, RAM, disk I/O) during application operation, and user interaction metrics (e.g., active window frequency).
*   **Usage Profile Creation:**  The agent builds a ‘Usage Profile’ for each user, detailing their typical software usage patterns.  This profile is stored locally, then aggregated and anonymized on a central server.
*   **Intent Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model (server-side) analyzes Usage Profiles to *predict* future software usage. This prediction isn’t simply “will they launch X”, but a probability distribution of which applications a user is likely to use, for how long, and with what intensity, given the current time, day of the week, and other contextual factors.
*   **Dynamic Licensing Adjustment:** Based on the intent prediction, the system proactively adjusts licensing.
    *   **Short-Term Licenses:**  For software predicted to be used *briefly*, the system could automatically procure short-term licenses (e.g., hourly) instead of relying on perpetual licenses.
    *   **License ‘Borrowing’:** Within an organization, licenses could be ‘borrowed’ from inactive users (verified by the agent – no recent activity) and allocated to users who are predicted to exceed their current license limits. This requires a centralized license pool and robust permissioning.
    *   **Predictive License Procurement:** The system forecasts future license needs across the entire customer base and proactively submits purchase requests to avoid compliance issues or service interruptions.
*   **Optimization Parameter Integration:** The existing optimization parameters (Claim 1, 12) are expanded to include:
    *   **Cost Per Use:**  A metric that considers the total cost of a license divided by the actual usage time.
    *   **License Utilization Rate:** The percentage of time a license is actively being used.
    *   **Idle License Cost:** The cost of licenses that are allocated but not being used.
*   **Reporting Enhancement:**  The report (Claim 7, 13, 19) includes:
    *   **Predicted Usage vs. Actual Usage:**  A comparison of the system's predictions with actual software usage patterns.
    *   **Cost Savings from Dynamic Licensing:**  A quantification of the cost savings achieved through dynamic license procurement and allocation.
    *   **Recommendations for License Optimization:**  Specific recommendations for optimizing license usage based on predicted and actual usage patterns.

**Pseudocode (Intent Prediction Engine):**

```
//Input: User ID, Time, Day of Week, Application List, Historical Usage Data
function predict_usage(user_id, time, day_of_week, app_list, historical_data) {
  //1. Feature Extraction: Create features from input data
  features = {
    time: time,
    day_of_week: day_of_week,
    app_list: app_list,
    historical_usage: historical_data
  }

  //2. Model Loading: Load pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network)
  model = load_model("intent_prediction_model")

  //3. Prediction: Predict probability distribution of application usage
  predictions = model.predict(features)

  //4. Output: Return probability distribution of application usage
  return predictions
}
