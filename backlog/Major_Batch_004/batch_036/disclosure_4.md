## Dynamic Email Thread ‘Splintering’ & AI-Driven Contextualization

**Concept:** Extend the linking capability to *actively* create new, logically-separated “splinter” threads from existing conversations, driven by AI analysis of conversation content. This goes beyond simple linking; it dynamically refactors email content into new, more focused streams.

**Specification:**

1.  **AI Context Analyzer:** Integrate a natural language processing (NLP) engine that analyzes email content (subject, body) within a conversation. This engine identifies distinct *topics* or *action items* present within the emails.  The granularity of topic identification should be adjustable (e.g., broad themes vs. very specific tasks).

2.  **Splinter Thread Proposal:**  Upon user interaction with a linked conversation (or automatically based on pre-set thresholds – see Configuration), the AI Context Analyzer generates a list of proposed "Splinter Threads". Each proposal includes:
    *   **Thread Title:**  A concise title generated by the AI, summarizing the thread's topic (e.g., "Project Budget Approval", "Marketing Campaign Feedback").
    *   **Relevant Emails:** A list of emails from the original conversation that are deemed most relevant to the proposed thread, with a confidence score indicating the relevance.
    *   **Participant Suggestion:** Suggests a subset of the original conversation participants who would be most appropriate for the new thread, based on their involvement in the relevant emails.

3.  **User Interface for Splinter Creation:**
    *   **Splinter Proposal Panel:** A dedicated panel within the email client displaying the Splinter Proposals.
    *   **Proposal Review & Editing:**  Users can review the proposed thread title, relevant emails, and participants. They can add/remove emails, edit the title, and adjust the participant list.
    *   **Splinter Creation Button:** A button to create the new thread.  Upon creation:
        *   A new email thread is initiated with the specified participants.
        *   The selected emails are automatically added to the new thread (either as forwarded messages or as linked references).
        *   The original conversation is updated with a reference to the newly created splinter thread.

4.  **Dynamic Linking & Cross-Referencing:**
    *   Any new emails added to a splinter thread are automatically cross-referenced in the original conversation.
    *   Users can easily navigate between the original conversation and its splinter threads.

5. **Configuration:**
    * **Automatic Splinter Proposal Threshold:** Users can define thresholds (e.g., "propose splinter threads if more than 3 distinct topics are identified in a conversation").
    * **Topic Granularity:** Adjust the sensitivity of the AI Context Analyzer to control the granularity of topic identification.
    * **Participant Suggestion Algorithm:** Configure the algorithm used to suggest participants for new threads.
    *   **Link Display Options:** Control how links to splinter threads are displayed in the original conversation (e.g., inline links, dedicated section).

**Pseudocode (Splinter Thread Proposal):**

```
function proposeSplinterThreads(conversation) {
  emails = conversation.getEmails();
  topics = analyzeConversationTopics(emails); // AI-powered analysis
  splinterProposals = [];

  for (topic in topics) {
    relevantEmails = filterEmailsByTopic(emails, topic); // AI filtering
    suggestedParticipants = suggestParticipantsForTopic(relevantEmails); // AI suggestion
    proposal = {
      title: topic.title,
      emails: relevantEmails,
      participants: suggestedParticipants
    };
    splinterProposals.push(proposal);
  }
  return splinterProposals;
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved email organization and clarity.
*   Enhanced focus on specific topics and action items.
*   Increased productivity by reducing information overload.
*   Facilitation of more effective collaboration.
