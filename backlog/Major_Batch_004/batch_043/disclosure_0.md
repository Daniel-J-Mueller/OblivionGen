## Modular, Bio-Integrated Device Mount

**Concept:** A device mount utilizing a lattice structure inspired by biological bone growth, capable of adapting to irregular surfaces and offering integrated sensor feedback.

**Specs:**

*   **Material:** Bio-compatible, flexible polymer matrix (e.g., TPU) infused with shape-memory alloy micro-wires.  Base material selection will depend on anticipated loads and sterilization requirements.
*   **Structure:** A 3D-printed lattice framework. Lattice density is variable, tunable via software, and dependent on expected load.  The lattice consists of interconnected, hexagonal cells.
*   **Attachment Method:** Micro-suction cups integrated into the lattice cells on one surface. Cup density is adjustable via software. Opposing surface features variable-friction pads.
*   **Adaptation Mechanism:** Shape-memory alloy (SMA) micro-wires embedded within the lattice cells. Activation via low-voltage electrical current.  SMA contracts, locally deforming the lattice to conform to the mounting surface.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Piezoelectric sensors embedded within lattice nodes, measuring strain and pressure. Data transmitted wirelessly (Bluetooth Low Energy) to a host device. Allows for real-time feedback on mounting stability and applied force.
*   **Power:**  Integrated thin-film battery and wireless charging capability.
*   **Dimensions:** Scalable, ranging from 5cm x 5cm x 1cm to 15cm x 15cm x 3cm. Customizable via software.
*   **Control Software:** API for controlling SMA activation, sensor data access, and lattice configuration.

**Pseudocode for Adaptive Conformity:**

```
FUNCTION ConformToSurface(surfaceData, activationVoltage)
    // surfaceData: Point cloud or depth map of mounting surface
    // activationVoltage: Voltage applied to SMA wires (0-5V)

    FOR each lattice cell
        //Calculate distance between cell and closest point in surfaceData
        distance = CalculateDistance(cell, surfaceData)

        //Map distance to SMA activation level
        activationLevel = Map(distance, maxDistance, 0, activationVoltage, 0)

        //Apply activationLevel to SMA wires within the cell
        ActivateSMA(cell, activationLevel)
    END FOR

    //Real-time feedback loop: Monitor sensor data. Adjust SMA activation if necessary.
    WHILE stability < threshold
        adjustSMA(sensorData)
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION adjustSMA(sensorData):
    //If strain sensor detects instability, apply additional SMA activation to that node.

```

**Potential Applications:** Medical device mounting on irregular anatomical surfaces, flexible electronics mounting, adaptive dashboards, conformal mounting for robotics.
