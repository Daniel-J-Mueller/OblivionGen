## Adaptive Measurement Granularity Based on Device Context

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the level of detail (granularity) of measurements collected from a client device *based on real-time device context*. This goes beyond simple on/off measurement collection and focuses on *what* data is collected, not just *if* it's collected.

**Specs:**

*   **Contextual Data Inputs:**
    *   **Device State:** CPU usage, memory pressure, disk I/O, network connectivity (type, signal strength), battery level, screen brightness, accelerometer/gyro data (motion state).
    *   **Application State:** Foreground/background status, active features/modules, current user interaction (e.g., typing, scrolling, button presses), network requests in flight.
    *   **Environmental Data:** Location (coarse or precise, based on user permission), ambient light level, temperature (if device has sensor).
*   **Granularity Levels:** Defined by the authorized user via the developer interface. Examples:
    *   **Level 0 (Minimal):** Only essential metrics (app launch time, crash reports, basic performance counters).
    *   **Level 1 (Standard):** Core performance metrics, network request timings, memory usage breakdown.
    *   **Level 2 (Detailed):** Function-level profiling, detailed memory allocation tracking, UI rendering performance metrics.
    *   **Level 3 (Verbose):** Log all API calls, system events, and internal state changes.
*   **Context-Granularity Mapping:** A rule engine within the client device, configurable via the developer interface, that maps device/application context to a specific granularity level. This can be expressed as:
    *   **Rule-based:**  `IF (battery_level < 20% AND app_in_background) THEN granularity = Level 0`
    *   **Machine Learning Model:** A trained model (potentially updated OTA) that predicts optimal granularity based on historical context-performance correlations.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The client device continuously monitors context and adjusts granularity levels in real-time.
*   **Measurement Prioritization:** When switching granularity levels, prioritize collection of critical metrics to ensure essential data is always captured.
*   **Transmission Policy Integration:** The transmission policy should consider granularity level. Higher granularity data may require more frequent or prioritized transmission.

**Pseudocode (Client Device):**

```
// Initialization
load_context_granularity_rules()

// Main Loop
while (application_running) {
  device_context = get_device_context()
  application_context = get_application_context()

  current_granularity = determine_granularity(device_context, application_context)

  configure_measurement_collection(current_granularity)

  collect_measurements()

  transmit_measurements(transmission_policy)

  sleep(measurement_interval)
}

function determine_granularity(device_context, application_context) {
  // Apply context-granularity rules or ML model
  // Return appropriate granularity level
}

function configure_measurement_collection(granularity_level) {
  // Enable/disable specific measurement modules
  // Adjust sampling rates
  // Configure data logging levels
}
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Battery Drain:** Minimizes data collection overhead when the device is under stress or in low-power mode.
*   **Optimized Network Usage:** Transmits only the necessary data, reducing bandwidth consumption.
*   **Improved Data Quality:** Focuses on collecting relevant data in specific contexts, improving the accuracy and usefulness of the collected metrics.
*   **Enhanced User Privacy:** Limits data collection when the user is not actively using the application or when sensitive information is involved.
