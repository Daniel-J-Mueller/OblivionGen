## Adaptive Multi-Hop Beaconing for Mesh Network Formation

**Specification:** A system to facilitate rapid and resilient mesh network formation leveraging adaptive beaconing rates and multi-hop relaying.

**Core Concept:** Extend the beaconing system beyond direct device-to-device communication. Enable devices to act as relays for beacons originating from distant devices, creating a wider sensing range and accelerating network discovery. Dynamically adjust beacon relaying based on network density and signal quality.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard 802.11 Wireless Communication Module (capable of operating in both AP and Station modes).
*   Low-Power Microcontroller for processing beacon information and managing relaying decisions.
*   Directional Antenna (optional, for focused beacon relaying).
*   Signal Strength Measurement module.

**Software/Firmware Components:**

1.  **Beacon Relay Agent:**  Responsible for receiving, analyzing, and re-transmitting beacons. Includes a filtering mechanism to prevent beacon storms (duplicate beacon re-transmissions).
2.  **Network Density Estimator:**  Calculates the density of devices within range, based on the number of received beacons. This informs the beacon relaying strategy.
3.  **Adaptive Beacon Rate Controller:** Dynamically adjusts the beacon relaying rate.  Higher relaying rates in sparsely populated areas, lower rates in dense areas.
4.  **Path Loss Model:** Estimates signal strength based on distance and environment. Used to prioritize relaying beacons from more distant devices.
5.  **Beacon Prioritization Algorithm:** Prioritizes relaying beacons based on a combination of signal strength, distance estimate, and beacon content (e.g., critical service advertisements).

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initial Beaconing:** A device initiates beacon transmission at a default rate (as in the provided patent).
2.  **Relay Activation:**  Upon receiving a beacon, a device assesses its signal strength and distance estimate. If the beacon originates from a distant device, and the device has sufficient battery power, it activates beacon relaying.
3.  **Relay Decision:** The device uses the Network Density Estimator to determine the local network density.
    *   **Sparse Network:** Increase the beacon relaying rate. Forward the beacon multiple times, potentially using different directional antenna settings (if available) to maximize range.
    *   **Dense Network:** Decrease the beacon relaying rate. Forward the beacon only once, or not at all.
4.  **Beacon Content Modification:**  Each relaying device adds a 'hop count' to the beacon. This allows devices to identify the origin and quality of the beacon.  A maximum hop count limit prevents infinite relay loops.
5.  **Network Formation:** Devices receiving beacons build a network topology map based on hop count and signal strength. This map is used to select the best path for data transmission.
6.  **Dynamic Adaptation:** The system continuously monitors network density and signal quality, adjusting the beacon relaying rate and network topology map as needed.

**Pseudocode (Beacon Relay Agent):**

```
function onBeaconReceived(beacon):
  hopCount = beacon.hopCount + 1
  if hopCount > MAX_HOP_COUNT:
    return // Prevent infinite loop

  networkDensity = estimateNetworkDensity()

  if networkDensity < SPARSE_THRESHOLD:
    relayRate = HIGH_RELAY_RATE
  else:
    relayRate = LOW_RELAY_RATE

  if relayRate > 0:
    beacon.hopCount = hopCount
    transmitBeacon(beacon) // Relay the beacon
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-Channel Beaconing:**  Use multiple wireless channels to reduce interference and increase network capacity.
*   **Beamforming:** Use directional antennas and beamforming techniques to focus beacon signals and extend range.
*   **AI-Powered Optimization:**  Use machine learning to predict network conditions and optimize beacon relaying strategies.
*   **Mesh Routing Protocol Integration:** Integrate the beaconing system with a mesh routing protocol (e.g., 802.11s) to create a self-healing and scalable mesh network.
*   **Security Protocol Integration:** Incorporate secure beaconing by integrating with WPA3 or similar security protocol.
