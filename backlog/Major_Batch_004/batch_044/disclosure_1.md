## Dynamic Selective Blur Masking via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Integrate biofeedback sensors (e.g., EEG, GSR) with the camera processing pipeline to create a dynamic blur mask that responds to the user's emotional or cognitive state. This creates a visually compelling effect and opens possibilities for augmented reality experiences tied to internal user states.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Biofeedback Sensor Array:**  EEG headset (detecting brainwave activity), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor (measuring skin conductivity indicative of emotional arousal), and potentially a heart rate monitor. These sensors must be wireless and capable of transmitting data via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
*   **Processing Unit:** A dedicated embedded system (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano) or utilizing existing smartphone/camera processing power to receive sensor data and execute blur masking algorithms.
*   **Camera System:** Existing camera hardware, integrated with the processing unit.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Sensor Data Acquisition Module:** Responsible for collecting raw data from the biofeedback sensors.  Needs calibration routines and noise filtering.
*   **Feature Extraction Module:** Extracts relevant features from the raw sensor data. Examples:
    *   **EEG:** Alpha, Beta, Theta, Gamma band power.  Focus detection via asymmetry in frontal lobe activity.
    *   **GSR:**  Mean skin conductance level, number of skin conductance responses (SCRs), amplitude of SCRs.
    *   **Heart Rate:** Beats per minute, heart rate variability.
*   **State Estimation Module:**  Utilizes machine learning (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Bayesian Networks, Support Vector Machines) to estimate the user's current emotional/cognitive state based on the extracted features. States could include "relaxed," "focused," "stressed," "creative," etc.  This module requires a training dataset to map sensor features to states.
*   **Blur Mask Generation Module:** Creates a dynamic blur mask based on the estimated state. The mask is a grayscale image with values ranging from 0 (fully blurred) to 255 (fully sharp).
    *   **State-Mask Mapping:** Define rules for mapping each state to a specific blur mask. For example:
        *   "Relaxed":  Gentle blur applied to the periphery of the image, emphasizing the center.
        *   "Focused":  Sharp image with minimal blur.
        *   "Stressed":  Strong blur applied to the entire image, creating a disorienting effect.
        *   "Creative":  Dynamic, swirling blur patterns applied selectively to parts of the image.
    *   **Procedural Blur Generation:** Utilize procedural algorithms (e.g., Perlin noise, fractal patterns) to generate interesting and organic blur patterns within the mask.
*   **Image Processing Pipeline Integration:** Integrate the generated blur mask into the camera's image processing pipeline.
    *   **Mask Application:** Apply the mask to the image using a convolution operation or similar image processing technique.
    *   **Real-time Performance:** Optimize the entire pipeline for real-time performance, ensuring minimal latency.
*   **API:** Provide an API for developers to access sensor data, control blur mask generation, and customize the system.

**Pseudocode (Blur Mask Generation):**

```
function generate_blur_mask(state, image_width, image_height):
  if state == "relaxed":
    mask = create_radial_gradient_mask(center_x, center_y, radius, blur_intensity)
  elif state == "focused":
    mask = create_full_sharp_mask(image_width, image_height)
  elif state == "stressed":
    mask = create_full_blur_mask(blur_intensity)
  elif state == "creative":
    mask = generate_procedural_blur_pattern(image_width, image_height, seed)
  else:
    mask = create_full_sharp_mask(image_width, image_height) # Default to sharp
  return mask
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Augmented Reality Experiences:** Create AR overlays that respond to the user's emotional state.
*   **Biofeedback-Controlled Photography:** Allow users to control image blur with their thoughts or emotions.
*   **Stress Reduction Tools:** Provide a visual representation of stress levels and help users learn to regulate their emotions.
*   **Creative Tools for Artists:**  Enable artists to create unique visual effects that are tied to their internal state.
*   **Accessibility:** Potential to provide visual cues based on internal states for individuals with cognitive or emotional challenges.
