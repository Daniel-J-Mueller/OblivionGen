## Adaptive Token Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the importance of tokens within the “predictive token list” (as described in the patent) based on real-time feedback from a reinforcement learning agent. Instead of static occurrence counts, the system learns which tokens are *most* predictive in different contexts.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Data Input:** Standard data set records with text attributes and prediction target attributes.
*   **Tokenization Module:** Standard text tokenization (e.g., word, subword).
*   **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** A policy-based RL agent (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO).  State: Representation of the current data record (text attribute, features derived from prediction target), current token weights. Action: Adjustment factor for each token in the predictive token list. Reward: Improvement in prediction accuracy on a validation set.
*   **Predictive Token List Manager:**  Maintains the list of tokens, their associated weights, and handles updates from the RL agent.
*   **Categorical Attribute Generator:** Generates the categorical attribute based on the weighted presence of tokens in the text attribute.
*   **Machine Learning Model Trainer:**  Trains the machine learning model using the generated categorical attribute.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Initialization:**  Initialize the predictive token list based on initial occurrence counts in the training data (as described in the original patent). Assign initial weights (e.g., 1.0) to all tokens.
2.  **Record Processing:** For each data record:
    *   Tokenize the text attribute.
    *   Calculate the weighted presence score for each token in the predictive token list. This is the sum of the token’s weight multiplied by its presence (0 or 1) in the record’s tokenized text.
    *   Generate the categorical attribute based on these weighted scores (e.g., thresholding, quantization).
3.  **RL Agent Interaction (Periodic):**
    *   Sample a batch of data records.
    *   Calculate predictions using the machine learning model.
    *   Calculate the prediction error (reward signal).
    *   The RL agent observes the state (record features, current token weights) and takes an action (adjusts token weights).
    *   Update token weights based on the agent's action.
    *   Retrain the machine learning model with the updated token weights.
4.  **Continuous Learning:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 continuously to refine token weights and improve prediction accuracy.

**3. Pseudocode (RL Agent Update):**

```python
# Assuming 'agent' is an instance of a PPO agent
# 'token_weights' is a list of floats representing the current weights
# 'record_features' represents the features derived from the data record
# 'reward' is the prediction error

state = (record_features, token_weights)
action, log_prob = agent.select_action(state)  # action is a vector of adjustment factors

# Apply adjustment factors to token weights
new_token_weights = [w * (1 + a) for w, a in zip(token_weights, action)]

# Update RL agent using reward, log_prob, and new state
agent.train(reward, log_prob, (record_features, new_token_weights))

# Repeat for a batch of records
```

**4. Enhancements:**

*   **Contextual Bandit Approach:**  Instead of a full RL agent, use a contextual bandit algorithm for faster adaptation.
*   **Token Embedding:** Represent tokens as vectors using a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT) to capture semantic relationships.
*   **Weight Decay:** Implement a weight decay mechanism to prevent overfitting to specific tokens.
*   **Explainability:**  Track which tokens contribute most to the prediction for each record to improve model interpretability.
