## Dynamic Obstacle Prediction via Temporal Data Fusion

**Concept:** Extend the current system to not only identify static obstacles but *predict* the future location of dynamic obstacles (people, moving boxes, etc.) by fusing historical depth and color data with short-term trajectory estimation. This anticipates movements, allowing the autonomous vehicle to proactively navigate around potential collisions rather than simply reacting to current positions.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Existing: RGB Camera, Depth Sensor (LiDAR or Time-of-Flight)
    *   Added: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – for more accurate motion estimation of the vehicle itself.

*   **Data Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  **Raw Data Acquisition:** Capture RGB-D data stream + IMU data.
    2.  **Obstacle Detection (Current):** Utilize existing system to identify obstacles in the current frame.  Output: 3D point cloud of static obstacles + list of dynamic obstacle candidates.
    3.  **Dynamic Obstacle Tracking:**
        *   Employ a Kalman Filter (or similar tracking algorithm) for each dynamic obstacle candidate.
        *   State Vector: [x, y, z, velocity_x, velocity_y, velocity_z].
        *   Prediction Step:  Predict obstacle position based on current state and IMU data (to account for vehicle motion).
        *   Update Step:  Correct prediction with new RGB-D data.  Use color information (object recognition) to maintain identity across frames.
    4.  **Trajectory Prediction:**
        *   For each tracked dynamic obstacle, predict a short-term trajectory (e.g., 1-2 seconds into the future) using a constant velocity or constant acceleration model. More sophisticated models (e.g., based on observed patterns of movement) could be used.
        *   Output: Predicted future positions (x, y, z) for each obstacle at discrete time steps.
    5.  **Collision Risk Assessment:**
        *   Project the vehicle's planned trajectory (based on current path planning) into the future.
        *   Check for potential collisions between the vehicle and the predicted future positions of dynamic obstacles.
        *   Assign a collision risk score based on proximity and predicted time to impact.
    6.  **Path Replanning:**
        *   If the collision risk score exceeds a threshold, trigger a path replanning algorithm.
        *   Prioritize paths that maximize distance from predicted obstacle trajectories.
        *   Generate a smooth, collision-free path and update the vehicle’s trajectory.

*   **Software Components:**
    *   Obstacle Detection Module (existing)
    *   Tracking Module (Kalman Filter implementation)
    *   Trajectory Prediction Module
    *   Collision Risk Assessment Module
    *   Path Replanning Algorithm (e.g., RRT*, A*)

*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Embedded system with sufficient processing power for real-time data processing (GPU acceleration recommended).
    *   Sufficient memory for storing historical data and predicted trajectories.
    *   Communication interface for transmitting obstacle maps and path plans to the vehicle’s control system.

*   **Pseudocode (Collision Risk Assessment):**

```pseudocode
function assessCollisionRisk(vehicleTrajectory, obstacleTrajectories):
  riskScore = 0
  for each obstacleTrajectory in obstacleTrajectories:
    for each point in vehicleTrajectory:
      distance = calculateDistance(point, obstacleTrajectory.lastPoint)
      timeToImpact = calculateTimeToImpact(point, obstacleTrajectory.lastPoint)
      if distance < safetyThreshold and timeToImpact < reactionTime:
        riskScore += 1 / distance  //Higher score for closer obstacles
  return riskScore
```
