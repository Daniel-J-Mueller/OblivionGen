## Automated Sorting & Redirect System - "Chameleon Conveyance"

**Concept:** Expand the unloading method to incorporate dynamic, item-specific redirection *during* the dislodging process. Instead of simply depositing items onto a single surface, the system actively *steers* items based on pre-programmed criteria.

**Specifications:**

*   **Modular Redirectors:** Small, independently controlled redirectors embedded within the deposit surface area. Each redirector is essentially a miniature conveyor belt section, or a series of pivoting deflectors. Density: approximately 1 redirector per 10cm².
*   **Item Identification:** Integrate a high-speed vision system *above* the unloading station. This system scans each item *immediately* before/during dislodging, identifying type, size, destination, etc.  Minimum frame rate: 60fps. Resolution: 5 megapixels.
*   **Control System:** A centralized processing unit running real-time pathfinding algorithms. Input: Item identification data. Output: Individual redirector commands.
*   **Redirector Actuation:**  Each redirector is driven by a micro-servo motor providing precise angular control.  Range of motion: ±45 degrees.
*   **Deposit Surface Configuration:** The deposit surface is a grid of individually addressable “cells”. Each cell has a small opening to allow items to fall through to a lower-level conveyor system (sorting area).
*   **Dynamic Path Planning:** The control system calculates the optimal redirector sequence to guide each item to its designated cell. Algorithm: A* search or similar pathfinding technique.
*   **Multi-Tiered Sorting:** Multiple levels of deposit cells. Items may be redirected upwards or downwards to reach the correct destination. Max height differential: 30cm.
*   **Jam Detection/Resolution:**  Sensors within the redirector network detect blockages or stalled items. Automatic retraction of redirectors or activation of small clearing mechanisms (e.g., air jets) to resolve jams.
*   **Calibration System:**  Automated calibration routine to ensure accurate redirector positioning and alignment.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
LOOP:
    ITEM_DETECTED = VISION_SYSTEM.SCAN()
    IF ITEM_DETECTED:
        ITEM_TYPE = ITEM_DETECTED.TYPE
        DESTINATION = DATABASE.LOOKUP(ITEM_TYPE)  //Lookup destination cell
        PATH = PATHFINDING.CALCULATE(CURRENT_POSITION, DESTINATION)
        FOR STEP in PATH:
            REDIRECTOR = STEP.REDIRECTOR
            ANGLE = STEP.ANGLE
            REDIRECTOR.SET_ANGLE(ANGLE)
        ITEM_DISLODGED()
    ENDLOOP
```

**Refinement Considerations:**

*   **Redirector Material:** Low-friction, durable polymer to minimize wear and tear.
*   **Vision System Integration:**  Lighting control to optimize image quality.  Calibration against known objects.
*   **Safety Mechanisms:** Emergency stop buttons.  Protective shielding around moving parts.
*   **Scalability:** Modular design to easily expand the system's capacity.
*   **Software Interface:** User-friendly interface for programming destinations and monitoring performance.
*   **AI Integration:** Predictive algorithms to anticipate item flow and optimize redirector configurations.
