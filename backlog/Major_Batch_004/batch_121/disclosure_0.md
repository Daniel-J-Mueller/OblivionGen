## Automated Optical Signal "Fingerprinting" & Predictive Maintenance

**Concept:** Expand the idea of optical power monitoring to create a comprehensive "fingerprint" of optical signals, not just for data path tracing, but for *predictive maintenance* of fiber optic infrastructure. This moves beyond simply knowing *where* the signal is going, to understanding the *health* of the signal and the underlying fiber.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sensor Enhancement:**

*   **Multi-Parameter Sensing:** Instead of solely measuring optical power, integrate sensors capable of detecting:
    *   Optical Polarization
    *   Chromatic Dispersion
    *   Optical Time-Domain Reflectometry (OTDR) – low-resolution, continuous background scan. Not a full OTDR trace, but a persistent “noise floor” reading.
    *   Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
*   **Micro-Vibration Detection:** Integrate MEMS accelerometers to detect micro-vibrations within the fiber cable itself. These can indicate cable stress, movement, or potential physical damage.
*   **Sensor Density:** Deploy sensors at *every* patch panel port, and optionally, at strategic intervals along longer fiber runs (using inline splitters/taps).

**2. Data Acquisition & Processing:**

*   **Time-Series Database:** All sensor data is streamed to a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) with high sampling rates (configurable per sensor/port).
*   **Baseline Creation:** For each port/fiber segment, establish a "healthy" baseline fingerprint based on historical data. This involves statistical analysis of sensor readings over time.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement algorithms (e.g., statistical process control, machine learning models – autoencoders, LSTM networks) to detect deviations from the baseline fingerprint. Anomaly scores are generated for each sensor reading.
*   **Correlation Engine:** Correlate anomalies across multiple sensors and ports to identify potential root causes.  For example, a sudden drop in SNR on one port, coupled with increased micro-vibration on a nearby fiber segment, could indicate a loose connector or cable stress.
*   **Event Triggering:** Configure thresholds for anomaly scores to trigger alerts and notifications.

**3. Predictive Modeling:**

*   **Failure Prediction Models:** Train machine learning models (e.g., survival analysis, regression models) to predict the probability of fiber degradation or failure based on historical anomaly data and environmental factors (temperature, humidity).
*   **Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Estimation:**  Estimate the RUL of fiber segments based on predicted degradation rates.
*   **Maintenance Scheduling:** Automatically generate maintenance schedules based on RUL estimations and criticality of affected services.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Distributed Sensor Network:** Sensors are connected to local edge servers (e.g., Raspberry Pi, industrial PCs) via Ethernet or wireless communication.
*   **Centralized Analytics Platform:** Edge servers stream data to a centralized analytics platform (cloud-based or on-premise) for processing and analysis.
*   **API Integration:** Provide APIs for integration with existing network management systems and IT service management (ITSM) platforms.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
// For each sensor reading:
sensor_value = read_sensor()
baseline = get_baseline(sensor_id)
deviation = abs(sensor_value - baseline.mean)
standard_deviation = baseline.std
z_score = deviation / standard_deviation  // Calculate Z-score
anomaly_score = function(z_score)  // Apply a function to map Z-score to anomaly score (e.g., sigmoid)

if anomaly_score > threshold:
  trigger_alert(sensor_id, anomaly_score)
```

**Novelty:**

This goes beyond simple data path tracing to provide a proactive system for monitoring the *health* of fiber optic infrastructure. The combination of multi-parameter sensing, anomaly detection, predictive modeling, and automated maintenance scheduling creates a significantly more robust and resilient network.  The continuous OTDR background scanning is also novel in this context, providing early warnings of fiber degradation. This moves the field from reactive troubleshooting to proactive maintenance.
