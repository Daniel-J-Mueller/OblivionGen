## Automated Sample Preparation & Multi-Analyte Cartridge System

**System Overview:** A fully automated, self-contained diagnostic unit capable of processing multiple sample collection devices (SCDs) simultaneously and running a panel of PCR-based or other nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) *without* any human intervention beyond initial SCD loading. This expands beyond single test execution.

**Core Innovation:**  A modular cartridge system integrating sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction/purification, and NAAT amplification/detection within a disposable unit.  The system incorporates robotic handling of SCDs and cartridges, and advanced fluidic control for precise reagent delivery and waste management.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **SCD Input Module:** Capacity for 24 SCDs.  Robotic arm for automated SCD retrieval and alignment.  Barcode/QR code scanner for SCD identification.
*   **Cartridge Handling Module:**  Carousel-style cartridge storage with capacity for 24 multi-analyte cartridges. Robotic arm for cartridge selection, insertion, and ejection.
*   **Multi-Analyte Cartridge:**
    *   **Sample Receiving Chamber:** Accepts biological specimen directly from SCD.
    *   **Lysate Preparation Zone:** Contains pre-packaged reagents for cell lysis and nucleic acid stabilization.
    *   **Nucleic Acid Purification Module:** Microfluidic channels and solid-phase extraction beads for automated DNA/RNA purification.
    *   **Master Mix Reservoir:** Pre-loaded with lyophilized master mix for multiple NAATs.
    *   **Reaction Chamber Array:**  96-well plate format for simultaneous PCR amplification of multiple targets.
    *   **Detection Zone:** Integrated optical sensors for real-time PCR detection (fluorescence, absorbance).
*   **Fluidic Control System:**  Microfluidic pumps, valves, and tubing for precise reagent delivery and waste removal. Closed-loop control system for automated fluid handling.
*   **Optical Detection System:** High-resolution fluorescence and absorbance detectors for real-time PCR analysis.
*   **Waste Management System:** Integrated waste collection and sterilization system.

**Software Specifications:**

*   **Cartridge Mapping:** Software automatically maps the requested NAAT panel to specific wells within the cartridge.
*   **Fluidic Control Algorithm:**  Precise control of fluid flow rates, volumes, and mixing parameters.
*   **Real-time PCR Analysis:** Automated analysis of fluorescence data, generation of amplification curves, and determination of Ct values.
*   **Quality Control:** Automated assessment of assay validity, including positive and negative controls.
*   **Data Management:** Secure storage and transmission of test results.
*   **User Interface:** Intuitive touchscreen interface for system control and data visualization.

**Novelty:**  The key innovation lies in the complete integration of sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection within a single, disposable cartridge and automated system.  This significantly reduces hands-on time, minimizes the risk of contamination, and increases throughput. This shifts the focus from point-of-care testing to fully automated, high-volume diagnostic processing, especially suited for centralized labs or high-throughput screening applications.
