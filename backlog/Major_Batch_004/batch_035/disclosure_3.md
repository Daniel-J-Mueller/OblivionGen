## Adaptive Acoustic Space Partitioning

**Concept:** Expand the privacy mode concept beyond utterance-level data deletion to create dynamically adjusted acoustic spaces for users. Instead of simply deleting data *after* an utterance requesting privacy, proactively shape the *recording environment itself* based on inferred user intent and ongoing analysis.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-microphone array (minimum 8 microphones) integrated into the device (e.g., smart speaker, phone, laptop). High-fidelity audio processing unit (DSP or dedicated chip). Optional: Directional speaker array.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Mapping Engine:**  Constantly analyzes the audio environment using the microphone array. Creates a 3D map of sound sources, identifying dominant voices, background noise, and reflections.  Uses beamforming and noise reduction algorithms.
    *   **Intent Classifier:**  Models user intent *before* an explicit privacy request.  Monitors keywords ("private", "confidential"), speech patterns (low volume, hesitant speech), and emotional tone. Outputs a 'Privacy Confidence Score' (0-100).
    *   **Acoustic Partitioning Controller:**  Dynamically adjusts the 'acoustic space' available to the user. This is achieved through:
        *   **Directional Recording:**  Focuses the microphone array on the user's voice, suppressing audio from other directions.
        *   **Virtual Sound Barriers:**  Employs signal processing to attenuate sounds originating from specific directions (e.g., a nearby window, a coworker’s desk). Essentially ‘carving out’ a quiet zone around the user.
        *   **Acoustic Camouflage (optional):**  Uses the directional speaker array to generate low-level masking sounds that further obscure the user’s speech from eavesdroppers. The masking sound should blend with the ambient noise and be imperceptible to the user.
    *   **Data Handling Module:** Remains consistent with the original patent – data associated with the current acoustic session is either stored with reduced fidelity (e.g., lower sampling rate, less detailed transcription) or not stored at all. Data handling is triggered by the Privacy Confidence Score exceeding a threshold.

*   **Workflow:**
    1.  The Acoustic Mapping Engine continuously analyzes the audio environment.
    2.  The Intent Classifier analyzes the user's speech and behavior, generating a Privacy Confidence Score.
    3.  If the Privacy Confidence Score exceeds a threshold:
        *   The Acoustic Partitioning Controller activates directional recording and virtual sound barriers, creating a focused acoustic space around the user.
        *   The Data Handling Module adjusts data storage settings.
    4.  The system continuously monitors the Privacy Confidence Score and dynamically adjusts the acoustic partitioning accordingly.  When the score drops below a threshold, the acoustic partitioning is deactivated, and normal audio processing resumes.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
acoustic_map = create_acoustic_map()
intent_classifier = load_intent_classifier_model()
partitioning_controller = initialize_partitioning_controller()
threshold = 70 // Privacy Confidence Score threshold

// Main Loop
while (true):
    audio_data = receive_audio_data()
    acoustic_map = update_acoustic_map(audio_data)
    privacy_confidence = intent_classifier.predict(audio_data, acoustic_map)

    if (privacy_confidence > threshold):
        partitioning_controller.activate(acoustic_map)
        data_handling.reduce_fidelity() // Or don't store at all
    else:
        partitioning_controller.deactivate()
        data_handling.restore_fidelity()
```

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond post-hoc data deletion to proactive environmental control, providing a higher level of privacy and security. It leverages spatial audio processing to create a dynamic ‘bubble’ of privacy around the user, adapting to their needs in real-time.
