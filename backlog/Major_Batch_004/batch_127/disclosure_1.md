## Dynamic Projection Surface Replication & Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Extend the 3D surface scanning and image correction capabilities to create a *replicated* projection surface, allowing for localized haptic feedback overlaid onto the projected image.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution depth sensor array (Time-of-Flight or Structured Light) integrated with the projector unit – *beyond* what's needed for distortion correction.  Must capture fine surface detail (sub-millimeter resolution).
    *   Micro-actuator array (piezoelectric or MEMS) covering the projection area. Density: 50+ actuators per square centimeter. Each actuator capable of displacement of 0.1-1mm.
    *   Transparent, durable, flexible substrate material covering the actuator array – must not significantly distort projected image.  (e.g. specialized polymer film).
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – High precision (sub-degree) for accurate tracking of device movement.
    *   Computational unit – High throughput processor with dedicated hardware for point cloud processing and actuator control.

*   **Software:**
    *   **Surface Mapping Module:** Processes depth sensor data to create a high-resolution 3D model of the projection surface. Includes noise filtering, outlier removal, and surface smoothing algorithms.  Output: Point cloud or mesh representation.
    *   **Haptic Profile Generator:** User interface for defining haptic profiles. Allows users to associate specific textures, shapes, or forces with elements within the projected image.  Profiles stored as force maps.
    *   **Real-time Rendering Engine:**  Takes projected image data and haptic profile data as input.  Generates actuator commands to create localized deformations on the projection surface, aligning with image elements.
    *   **Sensor Fusion Module:** Combines depth sensor data, IMU data, and actuator feedback to maintain accurate surface replication despite device movement or external disturbances.
    *   **Actuator Control Algorithm:**  Manages actuator array, applying force control algorithms to achieve desired surface deformations. Includes collision avoidance and safety mechanisms.
    *   **Image Warping Module:** Corrects projected image for actuator induced distortions.

*   **Pseudocode (Actuator Control Loop):**

    ```
    LOOP:
        // 1. Acquire Sensor Data
        depthData = AcquireDepthData()
        imuData = AcquireIMUData()
        actuatorFeedback = AcquireActuatorFeedback()

        // 2. Update Surface Model
        surfaceModel = UpdateSurfaceModel(depthData, imuData, actuatorFeedback)

        // 3. Determine Desired Deformation
        deformationMap = GenerateDeformationMap(surfaceModel, hapticProfile, imageElements)

        // 4. Calculate Actuator Commands
        actuatorCommands = CalculateActuatorCommands(deformationMap, currentActuatorPositions)

        // 5. Apply Actuator Commands
        ApplyActuatorCommands(actuatorCommands)

        // 6.  Warp Image (Correct for actuator deformation)
        correctedImage = WarpImage(image, actuatorCommands)

        //7. Project Corrected Image
        ProjectImage(correctedImage)

    ENDLOOP
    ```

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Interactive projections for tactile learning (e.g., feeling textures of projected objects).
    *   Virtual buttons and controls with physical feedback.
    *   Enhanced gaming experiences with tactile environmental effects.
    *   Accessibility aids for visually impaired users (e.g., projecting maps with tactile landmarks).
    *   Medical simulations with realistic tactile feedback.
