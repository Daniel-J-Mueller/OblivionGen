## Adaptive Granularity Time-Series Compression & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the wavelet-domain prioritization to dynamically adjust the granularity of time-series reconstruction based on real-time user/application needs and available bandwidth. Instead of fixed-level detail representations, introduce a 'detail budget' system.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure:** Time-series data segmented into variable-length chunks. Each chunk associated with a 'detail budget' â€“ a numerical value representing the acceptable level of reconstruction detail.

*   **Compression Phase:**
    1.  Apply wavelet transform to each chunk.
    2.  Quantize wavelet coefficients. Prioritization is still used, but coefficient selection is weighted *by* the chunk's detail budget. Higher budgets = more coefficients retained.
    3.  Coefficient ordering remains consistent with the provided patent.
    4.  Encode the prioritized & quantized coefficients, *and* the detail budget for each chunk.

*   **Reconstruction Phase:**
    1.  Receive compressed data (coefficients + budgets).
    2.  For each chunk:
        *   Based on the received detail budget, reconstruct the time-series data from the retained coefficients.
        *   Employ an *adaptive inverse wavelet transform*. This involves dynamically selecting the number of retained coefficients for the inverse transform based on the detail budget.
        *   If the detail budget is low, utilize a sparse reconstruction algorithm to approximate the missing details.
        *   If the detail budget is high, reconstruct with as many retained coefficients as possible.
    3.  Concatenate the reconstructed chunks to form the complete time-series data.

*   **Detail Budget Management:**
    1.  An external control mechanism (UI or application logic) sets the detail budget for each chunk. This could be manually adjusted by a user or automatically determined by the application.
    2.  A bandwidth estimation algorithm monitors network conditions. It can dynamically adjust the detail budgets of future chunks to maintain a desired level of data throughput.
    3.  Prioritization algorithm is aware of the detail budget and uses this data when making retention decisions.

*   **Pseudocode (Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstruct_chunk(compressed_data, detail_budget):
    coefficients = extract_coefficients(compressed_data)
    num_coefficients_to_retain = calculate_num_coefficients(detail_budget) //Algorithm to map budget -> # coefficients
    retained_coefficients = select_top_coefficients(coefficients, num_coefficients_to_retain)
    if detail_budget < threshold: //Low budget: perform sparse reconstruction
        approximate_missing_details(retained_coefficients)
    reconstructed_data = apply_inverse_wavelet_transform(retained_coefficients)
    return reconstructed_data
```

*   **Possible Implementations:**
    *   UI allowing users to zoom/pan through time-series data with automatically adjusted detail budgets.
    *   Network monitoring system dynamically adjusting reconstruction detail based on bandwidth.
    *   Real-time analytics pipeline prioritizing detail for critical segments of data.
    *   Machine learning model to predict the optimal detail budget for each chunk based on historical data and current context.
