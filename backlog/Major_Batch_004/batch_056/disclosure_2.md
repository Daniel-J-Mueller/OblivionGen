## Deferred API Call Prioritization via ‘Resource Futures’

**Concept:** Extend the deferred API call system to incorporate a ‘Resource Futures’ market. Allow clients to bid on prioritized execution of their deferred calls, creating a dynamic allocation of server resources based on client willingness-to-pay.

**Specifications:**

**1. API Extension - ‘Bid’ Parameter:**

*   Add a `bid_amount` parameter to deferred API call requests. This represents the client’s monetary offer for prioritized execution.  The bid is a floating point number representing a currency (e.g., USD).
*   API endpoint remains consistent. The `bid_amount` is treated as optional.  If absent, the call is processed as per existing deferred execution rules (based on capacity and user tiers).

**2. Server-Side ‘Futures Exchange’ Component:**

*   **Auction Engine:** Periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes), the Auction Engine evaluates all deferred calls scheduled within a defined future time window (e.g., the next hour).
*   **Bid Ranking:** Deferred calls are ranked by `bid_amount` (highest to lowest). In the case of ties, a random tiebreaker is applied.
*   **Capacity Allocation:**  Available server capacity within the future time window is assessed.
*   **Execution Guarantee:** The top-ranked bids, up to the available capacity, are *guaranteed* execution.
*   **Bid Settlement:**  For successful bids, the client's account is charged the `bid_amount`.

**3.  Deferred Call Scheduling Modification:**

*   Existing deferred call scheduling logic is adapted to integrate with the Auction Engine.
*   After each Auction Engine cycle, the schedule is updated to reflect guaranteed execution calls.
*   Non-guaranteed calls remain in the deferred queue, subject to standard capacity-based execution.

**4. Client-Side Implementation:**

*   Clients can access historical ‘execution price’ data (average `bid_amount` required to guarantee execution at a given time). This allows clients to optimize their bids.
*   Clients can set maximum bid limits to prevent unexpected charges.
*   Clients receive notifications indicating whether their deferred call was successfully executed via a bid, or deferred to standard queue processing.

**Pseudocode (Auction Engine):**

```
function runAuction(timeWindowStart, timeWindowEnd):
  deferredCalls = getServer().getDeferredCalls(timeWindowStart, timeWindowEnd)
  availableCapacity = getServer().getAvailableCapacity(timeWindowStart, timeWindowEnd)
  
  sortedCalls = sort(deferredCalls) by bid_amount descending
  
  guaranteedCount = 0
  
  for call in sortedCalls:
    if guaranteedCount < availableCapacity:
      call.setExecutionGuaranteed(true)
      chargeClient(call.getClient(), call.getBidAmount())
      guaranteedCount = guaranteedCount + 1
    else:
      // Call remains in deferred queue.
      break

  updateServerSchedule()
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `DeferredCall` object: includes `client_id`, `api_endpoint`, `parameters`, `scheduled_time`, `bid_amount`, `execution_guaranteed` flag.
*   `AuctionResult` object: includes list of successfully bid calls, total revenue generated, remaining capacity.
