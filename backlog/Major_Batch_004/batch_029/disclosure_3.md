## Dynamic Recommendation Weighting Based on Temporal Context & User Activity

**Concept:** Expand beyond static user preference weighting in collaborative filtering. Instead, dynamically adjust recommendation weights based on *when* a user is interacting with the system and their *recent* activity patterns.  This aims to anticipate needs based on ‘state’ – are they browsing late at night? During a commute? Immediately after a purchase? – and adjust recommendations accordingly.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

*   **Temporal Data:** Timestamp all user interactions (views, ratings, purchases, searches, dwell time on pages).
*   **Activity Vector:** Generate a rolling ‘activity vector’ for each user, representing their recent engagement with different item categories (e.g., last 5 items viewed/rated – [0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.5, 0.1] – representing percentage of recent activity in each category). Vector length is configurable.
*   **Contextual Data:** Detect user context (time of day, day of week, inferred location – commute/home/work – using device data with user permission, inferred ‘mode’ - browsing vs. purchasing).

**2. Weighting Function:**

*   **Base Weights:** Establish initial recommendation weights based on standard collaborative filtering (user ratings, item similarity).
*   **Temporal Modifiers:** Define ‘temporal profiles’ for each category (e.g., ‘cooking’ category peaks during evening hours, ‘news’ peaks during morning commute).  These profiles are derived from aggregated user behavior.
*   **Activity-Based Boost/Demotion:** Based on the user’s current activity vector, boost the weight of categories strongly represented in that vector.  Conversely, demote categories with low representation.
*   **Contextual Adjustment:** Apply multiplicative adjustments based on the detected context:
    *   *Commute Mode:* Prioritize short-form content (articles, quick reads).
    *   *Evening/Weekend:* Prioritize entertainment (movies, books).
    *   *Post-Purchase:* Suggest complementary items or related content.
*   **Formula (example):**
    `Final Weight = Base Weight * Temporal Modifier * Activity Boost * Contextual Adjustment`

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Real-time Event Stream:** User interactions feed into a real-time event stream (e.g., Kafka).
*   **Feature Engineering Module:** Extracts temporal, activity, and contextual features from the event stream.
*   **Weighting Engine:** Applies the weighting function to calculate final recommendation weights.
*   **Recommendation Service:** Selects and ranks items based on the weighted scores.
*   **Model Training:** Periodically retrain the temporal profiles and weighting function using aggregated user data. A/B testing used to compare new models against existing.

**4. Pseudocode – Weighting Engine:**

```
function calculate_final_weight(base_weight, user_activity_vector, category_temporal_profile, user_context):
  temporal_modifier = lookup(category_temporal_profile, current_time)
  activity_boost = dot_product(user_activity_vector, category_vector)  //Category vector represents preference for that category.
  contextual_adjustment =  //Based on user_context:
    if user_context == "commute": 0.7
    else if user_context == "evening": 1.2
    else 1.0

  final_weight = base_weight * temporal_modifier * activity_boost * contextual_adjustment
  return final_weight
```

**5.  Scalability Considerations:**

*   Use distributed caching for frequently accessed data (temporal profiles, user activity vectors).
*   Implement asynchronous processing for computationally intensive tasks (feature engineering, model training).
*   Horizontal scaling of the weighting engine and recommendation service.
