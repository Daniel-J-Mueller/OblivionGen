## Dynamic Sensor Fusion & Predictive Vulnerability Scoring

**Concept:** Expand the system to dynamically fuse sensor data *before* assessment data creation, incorporating predictive vulnerability scoring based on behavioral analysis. This goes beyond simply preventing rules from accessing raw sensor results; it creates a continuously updated, risk-prioritized view of the computing resource.

**Specs:**

**1. Behavioral Sensor Suite:**

*   **Component:** Expand native sensors beyond configuration/telemetry to include behavioral monitoring.
*   **Data Types:** Capture system call sequences, network traffic patterns (beyond simple intrusion detection), file access anomalies, process creation/termination events, and resource utilization trends.
*   **Output:** Raw behavioral data streams tagged with timestamps and resource identifiers.

**2. Dynamic Fusion Engine:**

*   **Component:** A real-time data fusion module residing within the computing environment.
*   **Function:**
    *   Receives raw data streams from the Behavioral Sensor Suite.
    *   Applies pre-defined and dynamically learned fusion rules to correlate events.
    *   Creates a normalized “Behavioral Profile” for each computing resource.  This profile represents the resource’s typical activity.
    *   Calculates an “Anomaly Score” based on deviations from the Behavioral Profile. This scoring should be tunable with weights for different anomaly types.
*   **Data Structure:** Behavioral Profile = {Resource ID, Timestamp, Event Type, Event Value, Anomaly Score, Confidence Level}.

**3. Predictive Vulnerability Scoring Module:**

*   **Component:** Integrates with the Dynamic Fusion Engine and rules packages.
*   **Function:**
    *   Receives Anomaly Scores from the Dynamic Fusion Engine.
    *   Applies machine learning models (trained on historical vulnerability data and behavioral patterns) to predict the *likelihood* of a successful exploit *before* traditional vulnerability scanning is even initiated.
    *   Assigns a “Predictive Vulnerability Score” to each computing resource, ranging from Low to Critical.
    *   Provides prioritized vulnerability recommendations to users.

**4. Rules Package Integration:**

*   **Mechanism:** Rules packages *do not* directly access sensor results. Instead, they consume the Predictive Vulnerability Score and relevant Anomaly Scores as input.
*   **Benefit:** This allows rules to focus on *risk* rather than simply identifying vulnerabilities. A low Predictive Vulnerability Score can suppress alerts even if vulnerabilities are present.
*   **Data Flow:** Sensor Data -> Dynamic Fusion Engine -> Predictive Vulnerability Scoring Module -> Rules Packages -> Assessment Findings.

**5. Adaptive Learning Loop:**

*   **Component:** A feedback loop that continuously improves the accuracy of the Predictive Vulnerability Scoring Module.
*   **Process:**
    *   Assessment findings (from rules packages) are used to validate or refine the Predictive Vulnerability Scoring Model.
    *   The model is retrained periodically (or in real-time) using new data.
    *   User feedback (e.g., marking false positives/negatives) is incorporated into the training process.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Vulnerability Scoring Module):**

```
function calculatePredictiveScore(anomalyScores, historicalData, userFeedback):
    // Load pre-trained machine learning model
    model = loadModel()

    // Feature engineering: create a feature vector from anomaly scores
    features = createFeatureVector(anomalyScores)

    // Predict vulnerability score using the model
    predictedScore = model.predict(features)

    // Incorporate user feedback (if available)
    if userFeedback:
        predictedScore = adjustScore(predictedScore, userFeedback)

    return predictedScore
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond reactive vulnerability scanning to proactive risk assessment. By fusing sensor data and applying predictive analytics, it can identify potential threats *before* they are exploited, reducing the attack surface and improving security posture. The separation of sensor data access and rules package execution enhances security and privacy.
