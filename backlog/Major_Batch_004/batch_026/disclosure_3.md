## Demand Shaping with Dynamic Quantile Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend demand forecasting beyond prediction to *influence* demand by dynamically adjusting pricing or promotions, guided by the forecasted quantile distributions. This isn't just *knowing* likely demand, but proactively shaping it towards optimal levels.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Demand Shaping Engine (DSE)
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Quantile distribution output from the existing forecasting system (patent 10783442). Specifically, access to all generated quantiles for a given item and time grain.
    *   Cost parameters: Underage cost (cost of stockout), overage cost (cost of unsold inventory), holding cost.
    *   Price/Promotion elasticity data: How much demand changes with price or promotional adjustments.  This can be item-specific, and ideally updated over time with A/B testing data.
    *   Inventory levels: Real-time inventory data.
    *   Target Service Level: Desired probability of meeting demand (e.g., 95% service level).
*   **Processing:**

    1.  **Cost Optimization:** For each item and time grain, calculate the expected cost (underage + overage + holding) for each quantile as the realized demand.
    2.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Based on the cost calculation and current inventory levels:
        *   If forecast suggests high probability of stockout (low quantile values consistently under current inventory), *increase* price or run a promotion to dampen demand (use elasticity data to predict impact).
        *   If forecast suggests high probability of overstock (high quantile values consistently exceeding inventory), *decrease* price or offer a discount to increase demand.
        *   The adjustment magnitude is determined by an optimization algorithm aiming to minimize expected costs *while* meeting the target service level. The algorithm should dynamically weigh the cost of stockouts vs. overstocks based on real-time conditions.
    3.  **A/B Testing Integration:**  Automatically launch A/B tests with different price/promotion adjustments to refine elasticity data and optimization algorithm performance.
    4.  **Quantile Shift Monitoring:** Track how the dynamic adjustments shift the *entire* forecasted quantile distribution. Are adjustments effectively shifting the distribution towards the desired target range? This feedback loop is critical for ongoing optimization.

*   **Outputs:**
    *   Recommended price/promotion adjustments for each item and time grain.
    *   Updated forecasted demand incorporating the expected impact of the adjustments.
    *   Real-time performance metrics: Cost savings, service level attainment, inventory turnover.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def demand_shaping(quantile_distribution, cost_params, elasticity_data, inventory_levels, target_service_level):
    # Calculate expected cost for each quantile
    expected_costs = calculate_expected_costs(quantile_distribution, cost_params)

    # Optimize for price/promotion adjustment
    adjustment = optimize_price_promotion(expected_costs, elasticity_data, inventory_levels, target_service_level)

    # Apply adjustment to forecast
    adjusted_forecast = apply_adjustment(quantile_distribution, adjustment)

    return adjusted_forecast, adjustment
```

**Novelty:** Existing demand forecasting focuses on *predicting* demand. This system goes a step further by actively *shaping* it to optimize costs and service levels, leveraging the full quantile distribution generated by the core forecasting system. The dynamic adjustment based on quantile shifts is a key differentiator.
