**Dynamic Profile Synthesis & Predictive Anomaly Scoring**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Instead of limiting the *number* of metrics per profile, the system dynamically synthesizes new, higher-level profiles based on observed metric correlations. These synthesized profiles aren’t pre-defined but emerge from data analysis.  This addresses the inherent issue of fixed profile structures not fully capturing system complexity. Simultaneously, it incorporates predictive anomaly scoring that operates *before* anomaly detection, influencing metric prioritization and profile synthesis.

**II. Components:**

*   **Correlation Engine:**  Continuously analyzes incoming metrics across all existing and synthesized profiles. Uses statistical methods (Pearson correlation, mutual information, Granger causality) to identify significant relationships between metrics.
*   **Profile Synthesizer:** When the Correlation Engine detects a strong, persistent correlation between metrics belonging to different profiles (or unassigned metrics), it creates a new, synthesized profile encompassing those metrics. The new profile inherits characteristics from its constituent profiles and gains new attributes reflecting the correlation.  Synthesized profiles have a ‘provenance’ history tracing their origins.
*   **Predictive Anomaly Scorer:** This module operates *before* anomaly detection. It uses a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) to predict the *future* value of key metrics. The difference between predicted and actual values generates a ‘predictive anomaly score’.
*   **Dynamic Prioritization Module:**  Uses the Predictive Anomaly Score to prioritize metric ingestion and processing. Metrics with high scores are given preferential treatment, influencing which metrics contribute to profile synthesis and anomaly detection.
*   **Provenance Tracker:**  Maintains a complete history of profile creation, merging, and splitting. This allows for backtracking and understanding how the system arrived at its current state.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Metric Ingestion:** Incoming metrics are initially associated with existing profiles based on a predefined classification system.
2.  **Predictive Scoring:** The Predictive Anomaly Scorer generates a score for each metric, anticipating potential anomalies.
3.  **Prioritization:** The Dynamic Prioritization Module prioritizes metric processing based on the Predictive Anomaly Score. High-scoring metrics are processed first and contribute more heavily to subsequent steps.
4.  **Correlation Analysis:** The Correlation Engine continuously analyzes incoming metrics, looking for significant correlations.
5.  **Profile Synthesis:** If a strong, persistent correlation is detected, the Profile Synthesizer creates a new profile encompassing the correlated metrics. The new profile inherits attributes from its parent profiles and gains new attributes reflecting the correlation.
6.  **Anomaly Detection:** Existing and synthesized profiles are monitored for anomalies using traditional anomaly detection techniques. However, the system now has a more nuanced understanding of relationships between metrics, leading to more accurate detection.
7.  **Provenance Tracking:** Every change to the profile structure is recorded in the Provenance Tracker.

**IV. Pseudocode (Profile Synthesis):**

```pseudocode
function synthesizeProfile(metricA, metricB, correlationStrength):
  if correlationStrength > threshold:
    newProfile = createProfile()
    newProfile.addMetric(metricA)
    newProfile.addMetric(metricB)
    newProfile.correlationAttribute = correlationStrength  // Store correlation as a profile attribute
    newProfile.parentProfiles = [metricA.profile, metricB.profile] // Track parent profiles
    newProfile.creationTimestamp = currentTime()
    metricA.profile = newProfile
    metricB.profile = newProfile
    log("New profile created: " + newProfile.id + " based on correlation between " + metricA.id + " and " + metricB.id)
  return newProfile
```

**V.  Further Considerations:**

*   **Profile Decay:**  Profiles that become inactive or irrelevant over time should be automatically decayed or removed.
*   **Hierarchical Profile Structure:** Synthesized profiles can be further synthesized, creating a complex, hierarchical structure that accurately reflects the underlying system.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):**  Provide explanations for why certain profiles were created and how they contribute to anomaly detection.
*   **User Interface:**  Allow users to visualize the profile hierarchy and explore the relationships between metrics.
