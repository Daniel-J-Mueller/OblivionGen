## Dynamic Sentiment-Driven Review Stitching

**Concept:** Expand beyond extracting single excerpts to *stitch together* multiple short excerpts from different reviews to create a more comprehensive and nuanced 'synthetic review' reflecting a desired sentiment profile.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

1.  **Review Corpus:** Access the existing corpus of item reviews (as per the base patent).
2.  **Sentiment Analysis:** Employ a multi-faceted sentiment analysis engine. This isn’t simply positive/negative.  Break down sentiment into granular categories: *Performance, Aesthetics, Value, Durability, Ease of Use*.  Each review will have a sentiment score *per category*.
3.  **Excerpt Segmentation:** Divide each review into “sentence-chunks” (2-4 sentences). Each chunk is tagged with its associated sentiment scores (from step 2).
4.  **Metadata Enrichment:** Tag each sentence-chunk with:
    *   Category affinity (which of the granular categories does this chunk primarily address?)
    *   Lexical features (keywords, named entities).
    *   Reviewer attributes (verified purchaser, expert reviewer, etc.).

**II. Synthetic Review Generation:**

1.  **Sentiment Profile Definition:**  The user (or a system acting on user preferences) defines a desired sentiment profile. This profile specifies desired sentiment strengths for *each* of the granular categories (e.g., "High Performance, Moderate Aesthetics, Low Price sensitivity").
2.  **Chunk Selection:**  An iterative algorithm selects sentence-chunks based on the following criteria:
    *   **Sentiment Alignment:**  Chunks are scored based on how closely their sentiment scores match the desired profile.
    *   **Diversity Penalty:** A penalty is applied to chunks that are lexically or thematically *too* similar to chunks already selected. We want a broad range of topics.
    *   **Reviewer Weighting:**  Chunks from higher-weighted reviewers (e.g., verified purchasers) receive a boost in their selection score.
3.  **Coherence Scoring & Adjustment:** After initial chunk selection, a coherence model analyzes the selected chunks for logical flow. If coherence is low:
    *   The algorithm attempts to swap out poorly-fitting chunks with better alternatives.
    *   Short “bridging phrases” are automatically inserted to improve transitions.
4.  **Stitching & Output:** The selected and adjusted chunks are stitched together to create a synthetic review. This review is then presented to the user.

**III. System Architecture:**

1.  **Review Data Store:** Existing review database.
2.  **Sentiment Analysis Engine:** External API or internal model.
3.  **Coherence Model:** Transformer-based language model fine-tuned for coherence scoring and bridging phrase generation.
4.  **Chunk Selection Engine:** Python module implementing the chunk selection algorithm (see above).
5.  **API Endpoint:** Exposes an API to receive sentiment profiles and return synthetic reviews.

**Pseudocode (Chunk Selection Engine):**

```python
def select_chunks(reviews, sentiment_profile, num_chunks):
    candidate_chunks = []
    for review in reviews:
        for chunk in segment_review(review):
            chunk.sentiment_score = analyze_sentiment(chunk) #per category
            candidate_chunks.append(chunk)

    selected_chunks = []
    while len(selected_chunks) < num_chunks and candidate_chunks:
        best_chunk = None
        best_score = -1
        for chunk in candidate_chunks:
            score = calculate_chunk_score(chunk, sentiment_profile) #includes diversity penalty
            if score > best_score:
                best_score = score
                best_chunk = chunk

        if best_chunk:
            selected_chunks.append(best_chunk)
            candidate_chunks.remove(best_chunk)

    #Coherence adjustment and bridging phrase insertion (omitted for brevity)
    return selected_chunks
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Personalized Stitching:**  Incorporate user-specific preferences (e.g., "I prioritize durability over aesthetics") into the sentiment profile.
*   **Dynamic Profile Adjustment:** Allow the user to interactively refine the sentiment profile by providing feedback on the generated reviews.
*   **Multi-Item Comparison:**  Generate synthetic reviews that compare multiple items based on desired criteria.
