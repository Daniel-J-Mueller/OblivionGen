## Dynamic Electronic Publication "Layers"

**Concept:** Extend the CSS modification system to support layered, modular content additions *directly within* the electronic publication itself, separate from external CSS/script files.  Think of it as a visual component system built *into* the document structure, allowing for highly personalized or contextualized experiences without requiring server requests for every modification.

**Specifications:**

*   **Layer Definition:** Introduce a new XML/HTML tag (e.g., `<layer>`) within the markup language document.  This tag encapsulates a self-contained content block (text, images, vector graphics, even simple interactive elements) and associated styling.
*   **Layer Visibility Control:** Each `<layer>` tag has a `visibility` attribute (default: `visible`).  This attribute can be controlled via CSS, Javascript, or a new, built-in "layer control" mechanism.
*   **Layer Context:**  `<layer>` tags possess a `context` attribute. This attribute allows for the definition of conditions under which the layer should be visible. Conditions can be simple CSS selectors targeting elements within the document (e.g., `context="article .highlighted"` â€“ layer is visible only if an element with class 'highlighted' exists within an article), or more complex Javascript-based expressions.
*   **Layer Types:** Define different layer types (e.g., `annotation`, `translation`, `augmentation`, `personalization`). This enables specialized rendering and behaviour. For example, an `annotation` layer might display comments, a `translation` layer displays text in a different language, or a `personalization` layer inserts user-specific content.
*   **Layer Bundling:**  Allow layers to be bundled into "layer packs" (e.g., ZIP files or custom formats). This facilitates the distribution and installation of pre-defined content sets.
*   **Layer Override Priority:** Establish a clear priority system for layer application. Layers can be assigned a priority level, determining which layers take precedence when conflicts arise. Higher priority layers override lower priority layers.
*   **User-Defined Layers:** Provide a mechanism for users to create and manage their own layers. This could be through a built-in editor or an external application.
*   **Layer Synchronization (Optional):** Extend the existing synchronization mechanism to support layer synchronization, allowing users to share their custom layers with others.

**Pseudocode (Layer Rendering):**

```
function renderDocument(document):
  renderedDocument = parseDocument(document)

  layers = getLayers(document)

  for layer in layers:
    if (layer.isVisible(document)) : //check layer visibility context
      applyLayer(layer, renderedDocument)

  return renderedDocument
```

**Example Usage:**

```html
<article>
  <p>This is the main text.</p>
  <layer context="p.highlighted" visibility="hidden">
    <p class="annotation">This sentence is important!</p>
  </layer>
</article>
```

In this example, the annotation layer will be hidden by default. It will only become visible if a `<p>` element with the class "highlighted" exists within the article.  Javascript or CSS could dynamically add the "highlighted" class to trigger visibility.

**Engineer Notes:** The primary challenge will be designing a robust and efficient system for managing layer visibility and applying layer styles without significantly impacting rendering performance.  Consider utilizing a virtual DOM approach to minimize unnecessary updates. Further exploration into WebAssembly for layer rendering might yield performance benefits.
