## Adaptive Sensor Mesh with Behavioral Profiling

**Concept:** Expand beyond individual sensor deployments to a dynamic, self-organizing mesh network of sensors that adapt to network traffic and user behavior. This moves beyond simple threat identification to predictive analysis and proactive mitigation.

**Specifications:**

**I. Sensor Types & Deployment:**

*   **Core Sensors:** Standard network activity monitoring (like in the provided patent) – IP addresses, file access, etc. Deployed initially by users/admins.
*   **Ephemeral Sensors:** Lightweight sensors spun up *automatically* in response to anomalous network activity. These sensors are short-lived, focused on a specific event, and disappear after the event is resolved. These are implemented as containerized microservices.
*   **Decoy Sensors:** Low-interaction honeypots deployed strategically within the network to attract and analyze attacker behavior. These emulate vulnerable services.
*   **User Behavior Sensors:** Sensors that analyze user application usage patterns (time of day, applications used, data transfer volumes) to build a baseline of “normal” activity.  These are optional, requiring user consent for data collection.

**II. Mesh Networking & Communication:**

*   **Sensor Mesh Protocol:** A lightweight, secure communication protocol for sensors to exchange data.  Uses a distributed hash table (DHT) for efficient discovery and communication.
*   **Localized Processing:** Each sensor performs initial data analysis (feature extraction, anomaly detection).
*   **Federated Learning:**  Sensors collectively train machine learning models for anomaly detection *without* sharing raw data. Models are shared, not data.
*   **Dynamic Topology:**  The mesh network automatically adjusts to network changes and sensor failures. Sensors discover neighbors and establish connections dynamically.

**III. Behavioral Profiling & Anomaly Detection:**

*   **User Behavioral Models:**  Machine learning models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Long Short-Term Memory networks) built for each user based on their application usage, network activity, and file access patterns.
*   **Network Baseline:**  Establish a baseline of “normal” network traffic based on aggregated data from all sensors.
*   **Anomaly Scoring:**  Each sensor assigns an anomaly score to network events based on deviations from established baselines and user behavioral models.
*   **Correlation Engine:**  Correlate anomaly scores from multiple sensors to identify potential threats.  Higher correlation = higher probability of a threat.

**IV. Automated Response & Mitigation:**

*   **Adaptive Firewall Rules:** Automatically adjust firewall rules based on detected threats. Block malicious IP addresses, restrict access to compromised systems.
*   **Traffic Shaping:**  Prioritize legitimate traffic and limit bandwidth for suspicious activity.
*   **Automated Isolation:**  Automatically isolate compromised systems to prevent further damage.
*   **User Alerts:**  Alert users to suspicious activity and provide recommendations for mitigation.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detectAnomaly(event):
  // Extract features from event (IP address, file hash, user ID, etc.)
  features = extractFeatures(event)

  // Get user behavioral model
  userModel = getUserModel(event.userID)

  // Calculate anomaly score based on user model and network baseline
  anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(features, userModel, networkBaseline)

  // If anomaly score exceeds threshold, flag as suspicious
  if anomalyScore > threshold:
    return "Suspicious Activity"
  else:
    return "Normal Activity"
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Sensor Registry:**  DHT storing information about all sensors in the mesh network (IP address, sensor type, capabilities).
*   **User Profile:**  Data structure storing user behavioral models, application usage patterns, and security preferences.
*   **Network Graph:**  Graph representing the network topology and relationships between systems.

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   Use a distributed database to store user profiles and network graph data.
*   Implement a message queue to handle high volumes of sensor data.
*   Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple anomaly detection servers.
