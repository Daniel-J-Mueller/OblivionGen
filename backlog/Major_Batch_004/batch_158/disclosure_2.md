## Dynamic Haptic Feedback System – “Feel the Interface”

**Concept:** Augment the gesture-based input described in the patent with localized, dynamic haptic feedback delivered through a wearable array. This system aims to create a more intuitive and immersive user experience by simulating the ‘feel’ of virtual buttons, textures, and edges.

**Specs:**

*   **Wearable Array:** A flexible, networked array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or micro-fluidic) integrated into a glove or wristband. Density: Minimum 50 actuators per 10cm². Range of actuation: 0-2mm displacement.
*   **Sensor Fusion:**  System integrates the existing camera-based motion tracking with inertial measurement units (IMUs) on the wearable array. IMUs provide low-latency, high-precision hand/finger pose data independent of visual tracking, mitigating occlusion issues.
*   **Surface Mapping:**  Software constructs a dynamic ‘virtual surface’ corresponding to the display. This surface isn't visually rendered, but exists solely as data for the haptic system. The system maps UI elements (buttons, sliders, text fields) to specific regions on this virtual surface.
*   **Haptic Rendering Engine:** A software module responsible for translating UI interactions into appropriate haptic feedback patterns. This engine incorporates:
    *   **Texture Synthesis:** Algorithm generates varying vibration patterns to simulate different textures (rough, smooth, granular).
    *   **Edge Detection:** Identifies boundaries of UI elements and provides localized ‘click’ or ‘bump’ feedback when the user’s fingers cross them.
    *   **Force Feedback Simulation:**  Mimics resistance when interacting with virtual controls (e.g., tightening a virtual screw).  This will be limited to tactile sensations, not true force application.
    *   **Dynamic Friction Modeling:** Adjusts the perceived friction based on the virtual surface being interacted with.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Low-latency wireless communication (e.g., WiGig, UWB) between the computing device and the wearable array.  Target latency: <5ms.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Automated calibration process to map the user’s hand geometry and motion range to the haptic array.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Rendering Engine – Button Interaction):**

```
function renderButtonPress(button_position, button_size):
    // Calculate contact point between finger and button
    contact_point = determineContactPoint(finger_position, button_position, button_size)

    if contact_point != null:
        // Activate actuators corresponding to the button area
        actuator_array.activate(contact_point, button_size)

        // Generate ‘click’ feedback – short, sharp vibration
        actuator_array.vibrate(contact_point, frequency = 200Hz, amplitude = 0.5mm, duration = 50ms)

        // Optional: Simulate button ‘travel’ – slight downward displacement of actuators
        actuator_array.displace(contact_point, distance = 0.1mm)

        // After release, return actuators to original position
        actuator_array.returnToOriginalPosition(contact_point)
    end if
end function
```

**Refinement:**  Expand the texture synthesis algorithm to incorporate procedural generation techniques, allowing for complex and realistic haptic textures with minimal storage requirements. Explore the use of machine learning to personalize haptic feedback profiles based on individual user preferences and sensitivities.
