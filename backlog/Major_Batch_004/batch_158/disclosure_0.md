## Adaptive Environmental Soundscapes

**Concept:** Extend the selective audio alteration to proactively *shape* the ambient audio environment perceived by the user during communication, rather than simply removing undesirable sounds. This moves beyond filtering *against* noise to *creating* a desired auditory backdrop.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires a multi-microphone array on the user’s device (phone, laptop, dedicated headset) capable of spatial audio capture *and* playback. High-fidelity audio processing unit.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Ambient Audio Profiler:** Continuously analyzes captured environmental audio to identify dominant sound events (traffic, birdsong, office chatter, etc.) and create a 'sound fingerprint' of the environment. This is a continuous process, creating a dynamic profile.
    *   **Soundscape Generator:**  An AI model trained on diverse audio libraries. Takes the ambient audio profile and user-defined preferences (e.g., "calm nature sounds," "focused ambient music," “enhance birdsong”) and generates a supplemental audio stream.
    *   **Spatial Audio Mixer:** Dynamically blends the generated audio with the live captured audio, applying spatial audio processing to create a realistic and immersive soundscape. Critical: the system *must* convincingly position the generated sounds within the user's environment.
    *   **Communication Channel Integration:**  Intercepts audio *before* transmission.  The system identifies the user's voice, isolates it, and then transmits *only* the cleaned voice data along with a description of the generated soundscape. The receiving device reconstructs the complete experience.
*   **User Interface:**  Simple controls to select pre-defined soundscape profiles (e.g. "Coffee Shop", "Forest", "Ocean") or customize individual elements (e.g. adjust the intensity of ambient music, add specific nature sounds).  Ability to create and save custom soundscape profiles.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `SoundscapeProfile`: Contains a list of sound events (with associated volume and spatial position data), a base mood (e.g. "Calm," "Energetic," "Focused"), and user-defined parameters.
    *   `AmbientAudioProfile`:  Dynamically updated data structure representing the current environmental soundscape. Includes identified sound events, their intensity, and estimated spatial location.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On User Device (Sending)

Loop:
    Capture Audio
    Analyze Audio -> Generate AmbientAudioProfile
    Isolate User Voice
    Generate Soundscape based on User Profile & AmbientAudioProfile
    Mix Soundscape with User Voice
    Transmit User Voice + Soundscape Profile Description

// On Receiving Device

Receive User Voice + Soundscape Profile Description
Reconstruct Soundscape based on Profile Description
Mix Reconstructed Soundscape with Received User Voice
Output Combined Audio
```

**Novelty:** Existing noise cancellation/filtering systems *remove* unwanted sounds. This system *adds* desired sounds, actively shaping the auditory environment *in real-time* for a more personalized and immersive communication experience.  The key is the dynamic blending of generated and captured audio, and the transmission of a soundscape ‘recipe’ rather than raw audio data.
