## Dynamic Item "Mood Boards" with AI-Driven Aesthetic Coherence

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple customization of a single item image to allow users to create dynamic "mood boards" *around* an item, driven by AI to maintain aesthetic consistency and suggest complementary visuals/themes.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Data Structures:**

*   `Item`: (Existing from Patent) – Contains base item properties, initial image, etc.
*   `MoodBoard`:
    *   `boardID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `itemID`: Foreign key linking to `Item`.
    *   `baseImageURI`: URI of the original item image.
    *   `aestheticProfile`: A vector representing dominant aesthetic characteristics (e.g., color palettes, texture preferences, style keywords – “minimalist”, “rustic”, “vibrant”).  This is generated and updated by the AI.
    *   `visualElements`: Array of `VisualElement` objects.
*   `VisualElement`:
    *   `elementID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `elementType`: Enum (Image, Text, Pattern, ColorSwatch).
    *   `elementURI`: URI of the visual element (image URL, text content, pattern definition).
    *   `positionX`, `positionY`: Coordinates within the Mood Board canvas.
    *   `scale`, `rotation`: Transformation parameters.
    *   `zIndex`: Layering order.

**2. UI Components:**

*   **Mood Board Editor:** A canvas-based editor allowing users to:
    *   Add new visual elements (from a library or uploaded).
    *   Drag, resize, rotate, and reorder elements.
    *   Adjust element opacity and blending modes.
    *   Apply filters and effects.
*   **AI Suggestion Panel:** Displays AI-generated suggestions for:
    *   Complementary images (based on aesthetic profile).
    *   Color palettes and gradients.
    *   Patterns and textures.
    *   Text overlays with suggested fonts and styles.

**3. AI Engine Functionality:**

*   **Aesthetic Profile Generation:** Analyze the base item image to extract dominant colors, textures, and stylistic features. Use machine learning models (e.g., convolutional neural networks) trained on large datasets of images categorized by aesthetic style.
*   **Content Recommendation:**  Based on the aesthetic profile, query a content library (or external APIs) to find visually similar images, patterns, and textures.  Rank suggestions based on relevance and aesthetic coherence.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  As the user adds or modifies elements on the Mood Board, dynamically update the aesthetic profile and refine content recommendations.
*   **Style Transfer:** Allow users to apply the aesthetic profile to a new image, generating a stylized version of that image.

**4. Workflow:**

1.  User selects an item and chooses "Customize" -> "Create Mood Board".
2.  The system creates a new `MoodBoard` and generates an initial `aestheticProfile` based on the item image.
3.  The Mood Board Editor is displayed, pre-populated with the item image as the base layer.
4.  The AI Suggestion Panel displays initial content recommendations.
5.  The user adds, modifies, and arranges visual elements on the canvas.
6.  The AI engine continuously updates the aesthetic profile and refines content recommendations.
7.  The user saves the Mood Board.
8.  A shareable URI is generated, linking to a rendered image of the Mood Board.  This URI can be shared on social media, messaging apps, etc.

**5. Pseudocode for AI Recommendation Engine:**

```
function get_recommendations(mood_board, aesthetic_profile, content_library):
  // Filter content library based on aesthetic profile
  filtered_content = filter(content_library, lambda item: item.aesthetic_score(aesthetic_profile) > threshold)

  // Rank filtered content based on relevance and diversity
  ranked_content = sort(filtered_content, lambda item: item.relevance_score(mood_board) + item.diversity_score(mood_board))

  return ranked_content[:num_recommendations]

function aesthetic_score(item, aesthetic_profile):
  // Calculate a score based on the similarity between the item's aesthetic features and the aesthetic profile
  // (e.g., using cosine similarity between color histograms, texture feature vectors, etc.)
  return similarity_score

function relevance_score(item, mood_board):
  // Calculate a score based on how well the item complements the existing elements on the mood board
  // (e.g., based on color harmony, compositional balance, etc.)
  return harmony_score

function diversity_score(item, mood_board):
  // Calculate a score based on how different the item is from the existing elements on the mood board
  // (e.g., based on color variance, texture complexity, etc.)
  return variance_score
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple image customization to allow for the creation of full-fledged aesthetic collages. The AI-driven suggestion engine and aesthetic coherence algorithms will empower users to create visually stunning and personalized representations of items. This provides a richer, more engaging experience than simply altering a single image.
