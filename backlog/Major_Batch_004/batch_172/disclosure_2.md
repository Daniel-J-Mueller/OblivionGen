## Adaptive Phishing Resilience via Behavioral Biometrics & Dynamic Deception

**Specification:** System for augmenting fraud detection by incorporating real-time behavioral biometrics of legitimate users *and* employing dynamic, personalized deception tactics targeted at potential phishers.

**Core Concept:** The current patent focuses on detecting fraudulent *sites*. This builds on that by focusing on fraudulent *behavior* during a session, and actively adapting the user experience to both verify legitimacy *and* confound attackers.

**I. Behavioral Biometric Baseline & Monitoring:**

*   **Data Collection:** Continuously gather user interaction data: keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure), mouse movements (speed, trajectory, acceleration), scrolling behavior, touch screen input (if applicable), typing cadence, and navigation patterns within the legitimate online service.
*   **Baseline Establishment:** Create a personalized behavioral profile for each user during normal activity. This profile isn't static; it continuously adapts to the user’s evolving behavior through a rolling average and weighted recent activity.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Employ machine learning models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Long Short-Term Memory networks) to detect deviations from the established behavioral baseline *during* a session.  High deviation scores trigger escalating security measures.
*   **Risk Scoring:** Assign a real-time risk score based on the severity and duration of behavioral anomalies.

**II. Dynamic Deception Layer:**

This is where the system actively interacts with potential phishers, making reconnaissance difficult and increasing the cost of a successful attack.

*   **Adaptive Challenge Questions:**  Instead of static security questions, present challenges dynamically generated based on the user’s browsing history *within* the legitimate site.  Example: “You recently viewed a product with SKU 12345. What color was highlighted in the product description?” (The color is pulled from the actual page the user viewed).
*   **Dynamic Form Field Manipulation:**  Subtly alter form field labels, help text, or even the order of fields during a transaction. This aims to disrupt automated bots or phishers manually copying information.  Changes are *imperceptible* to legitimate users (due to the baseline behavioral analysis, if they type 'wrong' it is auto corrected).
*   **Decoy Data Injection:**  Insert subtle, harmless data variations into requests. For example, adding a non-critical, unique identifier to a form submission.  A successful phishing attack would likely miss this variation, triggering an alert.
*   **Personalized "Honeypot" Fields:**  Include hidden fields in forms that are only visible to bots or automated tools. These fields contain unique identifiers. Any access to these fields indicates malicious activity.
*   **Content Shuffling:** Dynamically rearrange non-critical elements on a page (e.g., terms of service links, promotional banners).  Legitimate users won't notice, but an attacker replicating the page may miss the changes.

**III. System Architecture & Pseudocode:**

1.  **Request Interception:** All user requests pass through a central "Security Gateway."
2.  **Behavioral Analysis Module:**
    ```pseudocode
    function analyze_behavior(request, user_profile):
      extract_features(request) //Keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, etc
      deviation_score = calculate_deviation(extracted_features, user_profile.baseline)
      user_profile.update_baseline(extracted_features, deviation_score) //Adaptive learning
      return deviation_score
    ```
3.  **Deception Engine:**
    ```pseudocode
    function apply_deception(request, user_profile, deviation_score):
      if deviation_score > threshold:
        //Adaptive Challenge Questions
        generate_dynamic_challenge(user_profile.browsing_history)
        //Dynamic Form Manipulation
        modify_form_fields(request, user_profile.session_data)
        //Decoy Data Injection
        inject_decoy_data(request)
      return modified_request
    ```
4.  **Risk Assessment Engine:**  Combines behavioral analysis scores, deception detection signals, and other factors (e.g., IP address reputation, geolocation) to generate an overall risk score.
5.  **Action Engine:**  Based on the risk score, triggers appropriate actions:  challenge the user, require multi-factor authentication, suspend the session, or alert security personnel.



**Novelty:**  Existing phishing detection focuses on site characteristics. This approach focuses on *user behavior* during a session, combining that with *active deception* to both verify legitimacy and increase the cost for attackers.  The adaptive nature of the behavioral baseline and the dynamic deception tactics provide a significantly more robust defense.
