**Dynamic Cluster Weighting based on Temporal Decay & Social Influence**

**Concept:** Extend the cluster-based recommendation system by dynamically weighting clusters not just on internal metrics (size, homogeneity, user ratings) but also on *temporal decay* and *social influence*. This addresses the issue of stale recommendations and leverages the 'wisdom of the crowd' for improved personalization.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   User Interaction History (purchases, ratings, views, time stamps).
    *   Social Network Data (optional - connections between users, shared interests).
    *   Item Metadata (categories, descriptions, tags).
*   **Components:**
    1.  **Cluster Formation Module:** (Existing from base patent – performs initial clustering based on item similarity).
    2.  **Temporal Decay Engine:**
        *   Assigns a 'freshness score' to each cluster.
        *   Score decays exponentially over time, weighted by the average age of items within the cluster. Newly added/viewed items boost the score. Formula: `Freshness = e^(-λ*AvgAge)`, where λ is a decay constant.
    3.  **Social Influence Module:** (Activated if social data is available)
        *   Identifies users with similar interaction patterns (collaborative filtering).
        *   Calculates a ‘social weight’ for each cluster based on the collective interest of similar users.  If many similar users are currently interacting with items in a cluster, the weight increases.
        *   Formula:  `SocialWeight = Σ(Similarity(User,Neighbor) * NeighborInterest(Cluster))`, where `Similarity` is a similarity metric between users, and `NeighborInterest` represents the level of engagement of a neighbor with the cluster.
    4.  **Dynamic Weighting Engine:**
        *   Combines the `Freshness` and `SocialWeight` with existing cluster metrics (size, homogeneity, user ratings).
        *   Applies a weighted sum to calculate the final cluster weight: `FinalWeight = w1*Size + w2*Homogeneity + w3*UserRating + w4*Freshness + w5*SocialWeight`. The weights (w1-w5) are tunable parameters.
    5.  **Recommendation Generation Module:** (Modified from base patent)
        *   Prioritizes recommendation sources based on the `FinalWeight` of their respective clusters.
        *   Adjusts the recommendation algorithm to favor items from clusters with higher weights.

*   **Pseudocode (Recommendation Source Selection):**

```
function select_recommendation_sources(user, clusters):
  for cluster in clusters:
    cluster.size = count_items(cluster)
    cluster.homogeneity = calculate_homogeneity(cluster)
    cluster.user_rating = average_user_rating(cluster, user)
    cluster.freshness = calculate_temporal_freshness(cluster)
    cluster.social_weight = calculate_social_weight(cluster)
    cluster.final_weight = (w1 * cluster.size) + (w2 * cluster.homogeneity) + (w3 * cluster.user_rating) + (w4 * cluster.freshness) + (w5 * cluster.social_weight)
  sorted_clusters = sort(clusters, key=cluster.final_weight, descending=True)
  recommendation_sources = []
  for cluster in sorted_clusters:
    recommendation_sources.extend(get_items(cluster)) # Select items from the cluster
  return recommendation_sources
```

*   **Scalability Considerations:**
    *   Utilize distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Spark) to handle large datasets.
    *   Cache frequently accessed data to reduce latency.
    *   Implement incremental updates to cluster weights to avoid recomputation.
