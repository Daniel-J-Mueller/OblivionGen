## Dynamic Policy Inheritance with Contextual Overrides

**Concept:** Extend the policy translation and evaluation system to support *dynamic policy inheritance* based on runtime context, coupled with granular override capabilities. This moves beyond simple hierarchical inheritance to a system where policies are assembled *on demand* based on the current state of the resource, the user, and the environment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Contextual Policy Store:**

*   **Data Structure:** A graph database (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) will store policies as nodes.
*   **Node Attributes:** Each policy node will have:
    *   `policy_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `policy_language`: (e.g., XACML, Rego).
    *   `policy_content`: The actual policy rule.
    *   `inheritance_rules`:  A list of conditions (see #2) that must be met for this policy to be inherited.
    *   `priority`: Integer value determining inheritance order when multiple policies match.
*   **Relationship Types:** Relationships between policies define inheritance links. Links can be:
    *   `inherits_from`: Standard inheritance.
    *   `conditional_inheritance`: Requires evaluation of conditions before inheritance.
*   **Indexing:** Graph database should be indexed on `policy_language`, `priority`, and key condition attributes.

**2. Condition Definition & Evaluation:**

*   **Condition Language:** DSL (Domain Specific Language) for defining conditions. This DSL will support:
    *   Resource attributes (e.g., `resource.type == "database"`)
    *   User attributes (e.g., `user.role == "admin"`)
    *   Environmental attributes (e.g., `environment.location == "US"`)
    *   Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
*   **Condition Evaluation Engine:** A dedicated engine responsible for evaluating conditions against runtime context. This engine will be a microservice.
*   **Context Propagation:** Context information (resource attributes, user attributes, environment) will be propagated throughout the system via a standardized header format.

**3. Dynamic Policy Assembly Service:**

*   **Input:** Request to access a resource. Includes:
    *   Resource ID.
    *   User ID.
    *   Runtime context data.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Retrieve the root policy for the requested resource.
    2.  Traverse the policy graph, recursively applying inheritance rules.
    3.  For each potential inherited policy:
        a. Evaluate the associated conditions using the Condition Evaluation Engine.
        b. If conditions are met, add the policy to the assembly.
        c. Resolve any conflicting rules based on priority (higher priority overrides).
    4.  Return the assembled policy set.

**4. Policy Override Mechanism:**

*   **Override Policies:** Special policies designated as "overrides". These have higher priority than standard inherited policies.
*   **Scope:** Overrides can be applied at various scopes:
    *   **Global:** Affects all resources.
    *   **Resource Type:** Affects all resources of a specific type.
    *   **Resource Instance:** Affects a specific resource.
*   **Implementation:** When assembling policies, override policies are applied *before* standard inherited policies, effectively masking or modifying their behavior.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Policy Assembly Service):**

```python
def assemble_policies(resource_id, user_id, context):
    root_policy = get_root_policy(resource_id)
    assembled_policies = []

    def traverse_graph(policy):
        assembled_policies.append(policy)

        for inherited_policy in policy.inherited_policies:
            if evaluate_conditions(inherited_policy.conditions, context):
                traverse_graph(inherited_policy)

    traverse_graph(root_policy)

    # Apply overrides
    overrides = get_overrides(resource_id, user_id, context)
    for override in overrides:
        assembled_policies.append(override) # Overrides are applied last, effectively masking

    return assembled_policies
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  User attempts to access resource.
2.  API Gateway receives request and forwards to Policy Service.
3.  Policy Service calls Dynamic Policy Assembly Service.
4.  Dynamic Policy Assembly Service retrieves policies from graph database and assembles them based on conditions and overrides.
5.  Assembled policies are returned to Policy Service.
6.  Policy Service evaluates the assembled policies and authorizes or denies access.
