## Dynamic Contextual Audio Restoration & Synthesis

**Concept:** Expand the context-aware transcription system to not just *generate* captions, but to *restore* and even *synthesize* audio segments based on identified contextual keywords and visual data. This moves beyond transcription to full audio enhancement and creation.

**Specs:**

**1. Audio Restoration Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw audio stream, video stream, identified context keywords (from existing patent’s system), confidence scores for keywords.
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze audio for noise, distortion, missing segments.
    *   Query a large audio database (internal or external API) of clean audio samples indexed by context keywords. Example: Keyword "Construction" -> database returns clean samples of jackhammers, trucks, speech in construction environments.
    *   Use machine learning (diffusion models, GANs) to *replace* noisy or missing audio segments with clean samples *matched to the context keywords and visual cues* (e.g., if video shows a jackhammer, prioritize jackhammer audio).  Prioritization is weighted by keyword confidence.
    *   Seamlessly blend restored audio with existing audio.
*   **Output:** Cleaned and enhanced audio stream.

**2. Audio Synthesis Module:**

*   **Input:** Video stream, identified context keywords, confidence scores, optional content provider data (e.g., scene descriptions).
*   **Process:**
    *   If the audio is completely missing or insufficient, *synthesize* audio based on context keywords and visual cues. 
    *   Use a text-to-speech (TTS) engine with voice cloning capabilities (to maintain consistency) to generate dialogue.  TTS parameters (tone, speed, emotion) are dynamically adjusted based on visual cues (e.g., facial expressions).
    *   Generate ambient soundscapes using procedural audio generation techniques driven by context keywords (e.g., "Forest" -> generate birdsong, wind, rustling leaves). 
    *   Generate sound effects based on actions depicted in the video.
    *   Mix all audio elements to create a complete audio track.
*   **Output:**  Complete synthesized audio track.

**3. Contextual Blending Algorithm:**

*   **Function:**  Determines the optimal blend between original audio, restored audio, and synthesized audio.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of original audio.
    *   Confidence score of context keywords.
    *   “Completeness” score of the original audio (percentage of audio present).
    *   User-adjustable “Authenticity” parameter (controls the balance between realism and enhancement).
*   **Logic:**
    *   If SNR > threshold AND Completeness > threshold: prioritize original audio.
    *   If SNR < threshold AND Completeness < threshold: prioritize synthesized audio.
    *   In all other cases: blend original, restored, and synthesized audio using weighted averaging. Authenticity parameter adjusts weights.

**4.  Integration with Existing System:**

*   The Audio Restoration and Synthesis modules are integrated as a post-processing step in the existing transcription pipeline.
*   The existing keyword extraction system provides context keywords to drive the audio enhancement process.
*   The user interface includes controls to adjust the Authenticity parameter and preview the enhanced audio.

**Pseudocode (Contextual Blending Algorithm):**

```
function blendAudio(originalAudio, restoredAudio, synthesizedAudio, authenticity):
  snr = calculateSNR(originalAudio)
  completeness = calculateCompleteness(originalAudio)

  if snr > threshold AND completeness > threshold:
    return originalAudio  // Prioritize original audio

  if snr < threshold AND completeness < threshold:
    return synthesizedAudio // Prioritize synthesized audio

  // Blend audio
  weightOriginal = (1 - authenticity) * (snr / maxSNR) * (completeness / maxCompleteness)
  weightRestored = (1 - authenticity) * (1 - (snr / maxSNR))
  weightSynthesized = authenticity

  blendedAudio = (weightOriginal * originalAudio) + (weightRestored * restoredAudio) + (weightSynthesized * synthesizedAudio)
  return blendedAudio
```
