## Dynamic Device Ownership & Bio-Authentication Integration

**Concept:** Extend the device transfer/recovery system by incorporating biometric authentication *during* the transfer process and creating a dynamic ownership profile tied to the device, leveraging a decentralized, permissioned blockchain. This adds layers of security *and* enables granular control over device functionality post-transfer, even beyond the scope of simply disabling access.

**Specs:**

*   **Blockchain Integration:** Implement a private, permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) to manage device ownership records. Each device receives a unique identifier registered on the blockchain.
*   **Biometric Transfer Protocol:** 
    *   During a desired transfer, *both* the current owner and the prospective new owner must authenticate via biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition, voiceprint) through a dedicated device app.
    *   The app transmits a secure, cryptographically signed transfer request to the blockchain network.
    *   The network validates *both* biometric signatures against registered profiles.
    *   Upon successful validation, the blockchain record updates the device's ownership to the new user.
*   **Dynamic Ownership Profiles:**  Beyond simple "on/off" access, define granular permissions linked to the blockchain record. Examples:
    *   **Content Restrictions:** Owner can pre-define content types (e.g., work documents, personal photos) inaccessible to the new owner, even post-transfer.  Implemented via device-side encryption keys controlled by the original owner.
    *   **Functional Limitations:**  Original owner can restrict access to certain device features (e.g., camera, microphone, location services) for the new owner.
    *   **Time-Limited Access:**  Ownership can be programmed for automatic reversion to the original owner after a defined period (e.g., loaner devices).
*   **"Ghost Mode" & Data Wipe:** Integrate a "Ghost Mode" triggered *during* an unauthorized transfer attempt (detected by failed biometric authentication).
    *   "Ghost Mode" activates a secure data wipe (selective or full) while simultaneously transmitting the device’s last known location.
    *   Post-wipe, the device enters a limited-functionality mode solely for recovery/tracing.
*   **Reward Tokenization:** Instead of direct monetary reward, offer reward tokens redeemable within a connected ecosystem (app store, service subscriptions) for device recovery. This fosters a stronger incentive and increases brand loyalty. Tokens are managed on the blockchain.

**Pseudocode (Biometric Transfer Sequence):**

```
Function InitiateTransfer(deviceID, newOwnerID):
    // Current Owner Initiates Transfer
    Prompt Current Owner for Biometric Authentication
    If Authentication Fails:
        Return "Authentication Failed"

    // Request Biometric Authentication from New Owner
    Prompt New Owner for Biometric Authentication
    If Authentication Fails:
        Return "New Owner Authentication Failed"

    // Create Transfer Transaction
    transaction = CreateTransferTransaction(deviceID, currentOwnerID, newOwnerID)
    Sign Transaction with Current Owner’s Private Key

    // Submit Transaction to Blockchain Network
    SubmitTransaction(transaction)

    // Wait for Blockchain Confirmation
    If Transaction Confirmed:
        Update Device Ownership Record on Blockchain
        Return “Transfer Successful”
    Else:
        Return “Transfer Failed”
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Secure Enclave: Leverage device secure enclave (e.g., Apple Secure Enclave, Qualcomm Secure Processing Unit) to store cryptographic keys and perform biometric authentication securely.
*   Trusted Platform Module (TPM): Incorporate TPM for secure key storage and attestation.
