## Adaptive Key Hierarchy with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Introduce a multi-layered key hierarchy where key lifetimes are dynamically adjusted based on access patterns and perceived threat levels. This builds on the existing redundant key management by adding a temporal dimension to security.

**Specs:**

*   **Key Layers:** Implement at least three key layers:
    *   *Ephemeral Keys:* Short-lived keys (hours/days) used for immediate data encryption.
    *   *Intermediate Keys:* Moderate lifespan (weeks/months), encrypt Ephemeral Keys.
    *   *Root Keys:* Long-lived (years), encrypt Intermediate Keys.
*   **Access Pattern Monitoring:** Continuously monitor data access frequency. High-frequency access increases the 'urgency' score.
*   **Threat Level Assessment:** Integrate with external threat intelligence feeds and internal anomaly detection systems.  Events like detected intrusion attempts, unusual geographic access, or pattern deviations increase a 'risk' score.
*   **Dynamic Key Rotation:**  
    *   `IF (urgency + risk > threshold)` THEN rotate Ephemeral Keys.
    *   `IF (risk > high_threshold)` THEN rotate Intermediate Keys.
    *   Root key rotation is infrequent and requires stringent authorization.
*   **Temporal Decay Function:** Each key layer has a decay function.  As time passes since a key's last use, the decay function reduces the key's 'strength' (e.g., a weighting factor in encryption). This makes older, unused keys less valuable to attackers.
    *   `strength = initial_strength * e^(-decay_rate * time_since_last_use)`
*   **Key Revocation List (KRL):**  Maintain a KRL accessible to all storage nodes. If a key is compromised, add it to the KRL.  All new encryption operations will exclude KRL entries.
*   **Data Segmentation & Sharding:**  Data is divided into shards. Each shard is encrypted with a unique Ephemeral Key. Shards are distributed across storage nodes as in the original patent.

**Pseudocode (Key Rotation Logic):**

```
function rotate_keys(shard_data, current_ephemeral_key, urgency_score, risk_score):
  threshold = 5  // Adjust as needed
  high_threshold = 8

  if (urgency_score + risk_score > threshold):
    new_ephemeral_key = generate_new_key()
    encrypted_shard_data = encrypt(shard_data, new_ephemeral_key)
    intermediate_key = get_intermediate_key()
    encrypted_intermediate_key = encrypt(new_ephemeral_key, intermediate_key)
    store(encrypted_intermediate_key) // Store alongside encrypted shard
    return encrypted_shard_data
  else:
    return encrypt(shard_data, current_ephemeral_key)

function check_intermediate_key_rotation(risk_score):
  high_threshold = 8
  if(risk_score > high_threshold):
    new_intermediate_key = generate_new_key()
    # Re-encrypt all Ephemeral Keys under new Intermediate key
    # Update KRL if necessary
    return new_intermediate_key
  else:
    return current_intermediate_key
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   **Performance Overhead:** Key rotation introduces performance overhead. Optimize encryption/decryption algorithms and caching mechanisms.
*   **Key Management Infrastructure:** Robust key management infrastructure is critical. HSMs (Hardware Security Modules) are recommended for secure key storage and generation.
*   **Auditability:** Comprehensive audit logging of all key rotation events is essential for security investigations.
*   **Scalability:** The system must scale to handle a large number of keys and storage nodes.
