## Adaptive Multi-Sensory ‘Echo’ System

**Concept:** Extend the ‘non-responsive’ content delivery beyond simple additional information. Create a system that actively *echoes* the user’s command through multi-sensory feedback, subtly altering the experience based on user profile and inferred emotional state.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** “Echo Generator”. Receives initial command data, first output data, and user profile data.
*   **Sensory Modules:**
    *   **Haptic Module:** Controls localized vibration patterns.
    *   **Ambient Lighting Module:** Controls color and intensity of surrounding lighting.
    *   **Aural Module:** Controls subtle soundscapes – not direct responses, but evocative ambient sounds.
    *   **Olfactory Module:** (Optional) – Controlled scent diffusion. Requires safe, hypoallergenic scents.
*   **User Profile Expansion:** Beyond preferences, profile data includes:
    *   **Emotional Baseline:** Derived from historical interaction data (voice analysis, response times, content choices).
    *   **Sensory Sensitivity:** User-defined preferences for intensity levels within each sensory module.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** Location, time of day, current activity (determined via device sensors).
*   **Echo Generation Algorithm:**
    1.  **Command Analysis:** Analyze the initial command to identify its core *intent* (e.g., "play music" – intent = entertainment, relaxation).
    2.  **Sensory Mapping:** Map the intent to a set of abstract sensory ‘primitives’ (e.g., entertainment = vibrant color, pulsing vibration, upbeat soundscape).
    3.  **Emotional Adjustment:** Modify the sensory primitives based on the user’s current emotional state. (e.g., If user is stressed, dampen vibrancy, introduce calming tones).
    4.  **Echo Presentation:** Trigger the Sensory Modules to deliver the Echo concurrently with the primary output. The Echo should *not* distract from the primary output, but enhance the overall experience.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function generateEcho(commandData, outputData, userProfile) {
  intent = analyzeIntent(commandData);
  sensoryPrimitives = mapIntentToPrimitives(intent);

  emotionalState = getUserEmotionalState(userProfile);
  adjustedPrimitives = adjustPrimitivesForEmotion(sensoryPrimitives, emotionalState);

  // Trigger Sensory Modules:
  hapticModule.trigger(adjustedPrimitives.haptic);
  lightingModule.set(adjustedPrimitives.lighting);
  auralModule.play(adjustedPrimitives.aural);

  //Optional olfactoryModule trigger
}
```

*   **Example:** User says “Set alarm for 7 AM”. The system delivers the alarm confirmation (primary output). Simultaneously, the Echo Generator:
    *   Triggers a gentle, pulsing vibration in the user’s wristband (Haptic).
    *   Subtly shifts ambient lighting to a soft blue hue (Lighting).
    *   Plays a quiet, nature-inspired soundscape (Aural).

    The intention is to associate the alarm setting with a feeling of calm and preparedness, rather than jarring interruption.
