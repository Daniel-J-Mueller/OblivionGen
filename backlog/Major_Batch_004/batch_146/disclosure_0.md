## Autonomous Swarm Mapping & Reconstruction

**System Overview:** A networked system of miniaturized UAVs operating in a coordinated swarm to create dynamic 3D maps and reconstructions of environments, prioritizing speed and adaptability over absolute precision. This system will emphasize rapid environmental understanding for time-sensitive applications.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **UAV Platform:** Modified miniaturized UAV (as per the base patent), equipped with:
    *   High-speed, low-resolution (720p) cameras (x3, arranged for overlapping fields of view)
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) â€“ high frequency data capture.
    *   Short-range (50-100m) Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio transceivers for inter-UAV communication & relative positioning.
    *   Edge processing unit (low-power ARM Cortex-A series processor)
*   **Ground Station:** Server-class computer with high-bandwidth network connection.
*   **Beacon Network (Optional):** A sparse network of fixed UWB beacons deployed within the operational area to augment positioning accuracy, particularly in GPS-denied environments.

**Software Components:**

*   **Swarm Coordination Module:**  Runs on each UAV and manages:
    *   UWB-based relative positioning and inter-UAV distance maintenance.
    *   Dynamic task allocation based on environmental features and ground station requests.
    *   Collision avoidance algorithms.
    *   Data stream prioritization and compression.
*   **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) Engine (Distributed):**  A modified visual SLAM algorithm running *partially* on each UAV (feature detection & initial mapping) and *centrally* on the ground station (map fusion, loop closure, refinement).  The UAVs transmit sparse point clouds and feature lists, rather than full images.
*   **Reconstruction Module (Ground Station):**  Assembles the sparse point clouds into a 3D mesh.  Employs procedural generation techniques to fill gaps and create a visually coherent reconstruction. Includes tools for texture mapping and object labeling (potentially with AI assistance).
*   **Dynamic Tasking API:** Allows a user to specify areas of interest, request specific object detection (e.g., identify all red vehicles), or initiate targeted searches.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Deployment:** Multiple UAVs are launched into the operational area.
2.  **Swarm Formation:** UAVs automatically form a loose, dynamic swarm.  Swarm topology adapts to environment and task requirements.
3.  **Data Acquisition:** Each UAV captures low-resolution video and IMU data while navigating its assigned area.
4.  **Distributed SLAM:**
    *   Each UAV performs initial feature detection and local mapping.
    *   Sparse point clouds and feature lists are transmitted to the ground station via UWB mesh networking.
5.  **Map Fusion & Reconstruction:** The ground station SLAM engine fuses the data from all UAVs to create a consistent 3D map. Procedural generation fills in gaps and smooths the reconstruction.
6.  **Dynamic Tasking:** The user interacts with the system via the Dynamic Tasking API. The system prioritizes data acquisition and processing based on the user's requests.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Coordination Module):**

```
LOOP:
  Receive UWB data from neighboring UAVs
  Calculate relative position and velocity
  Maintain safe distance from neighbors (collision avoidance)

  Receive task assignment from Ground Station (Area to scan, object to find)

  Plan local path based on task assignment & obstacle avoidance

  Navigate along path

  Capture video & IMU data

  Transmit data to Ground Station (Compressed sparse point cloud + feature list)

  Update swarm coordination data (position, velocity, status)
ENDLOOP
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple aerial imagery capture and static map generation. It focuses on *dynamic* environmental understanding, leveraging a distributed processing approach and procedural reconstruction techniques to create a continuously updated 3D model of the environment. The emphasis on low-resolution data and sparse point clouds reduces bandwidth requirements and processing load, enabling rapid map updates even in challenging conditions. The distributed nature of the SLAM engine makes the system more robust and scalable.
