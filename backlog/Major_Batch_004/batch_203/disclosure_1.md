## Adaptive Query Plan ‘Shadowing’ & Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the cost-based query optimization to proactively ‘shadow’ query executions across nodes, building a predictive model of performance *during* execution, and dynamically shifting execution paths. This moves beyond pre-execution cost estimation towards *runtime* adaptation informed by actual observed performance.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** ‘Shadow Executor’ - a lightweight process mirroring the primary query executor on each node. Receives a copy of query fragments/steps.
*   **Data Collection:** Shadow Executor monitors actual execution metrics (CPU cycles, I/O latency, network transfer, memory usage) for each fragment. These are timestamped and correlated with the fragment ID.
*   **Prediction Model:** A time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) is trained on historical Shadow Executor data, node characteristics (CPU speed, RAM, disk type), and data characteristics (table size, data skew).
*   **Dynamic Plan Switching:**  
    *   During primary query execution, the prediction model forecasts the completion time of the current fragment on the current node.
    *   If the predicted completion time exceeds a threshold (adaptive, based on overall query latency goals), the system *dynamically* redirects subsequent fragments to a different node.
    *   Redirection utilizes a pre-established communication channel and serialized query state.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Observed performance of redirected fragments is fed back into the prediction model to refine its accuracy.
*   **Cost Model Integration:** The Shadow Executor’s runtime data is integrated with the pre-execution cost model, creating a hybrid approach.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Plan Switching):**

```
function execute_fragment(fragment_id, node_id, query_state)
  shadow_executor = get_shadow_executor(node_id)
  predicted_completion_time = shadow_executor.predict_completion_time(fragment_id, query_state)

  if predicted_completion_time > latency_threshold:
    best_alternate_node = find_best_alternate_node(fragment_id, query_state)
    transfer_query_state(node_id, best_alternate_node, query_state)
    execute_fragment(fragment_id, best_alternate_node, query_state) // Recursive call
  else:
    // Execute fragment on current node
    execute_on_node(fragment_id, node_id, query_state)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `FragmentMetadata`: (fragment_id, node_id, start_time, end_time, CPU_cycles, IO_latency, network_transfer, memory_usage)
*   `NodeCharacteristics`: (CPU_speed, RAM_size, disk_type, network_bandwidth)
*   `QueryState`: Serialized representation of the query execution context (e.g., intermediate results, current index).
