## Dynamic Subscription Item ‘Ecosystem’ Visualizer

**Concept:** Expand the drag-and-drop calendar/table interface to represent a user’s subscription items not as isolated deliveries, but as components within interconnected ‘ecosystems’ – representing broader life goals or projects. This shifts from *scheduling deliveries* to *facilitating progress* toward user-defined objectives.

**Specs:**

*   **Ecosystem Creation:** User interface element to define ‘Ecosystems’ (e.g., “Home Fitness”, “Gourmet Cooking”, “Baby’s First Year”).  Ecosystems are visually represented as customizable graphs or node-link diagrams.
*   **Item Association:** When adding a subscription item (e.g., protein powder, spice blend, diapers), the user assigns it to one or more Ecosystems.  Items become nodes in the associated Ecosystem graph.
*   **Dependency Mapping:**  Allow users to define dependencies *between* items within an Ecosystem.  For example, “Requires: Blender” under “Smoothie Ingredients”.  Visual representation as arrows/links between nodes.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Based on delivery schedules and user input (e.g., “Used 2/3 of protein powder”), the system visually represents progress *within* each Ecosystem. Progress could be a node color gradient, percentage complete overlay, or animated state change.
*   **‘Moment’ Triggering:**  Ecosystems can define ‘Moments’ – specific states or combinations of item delivery/usage that trigger actions. Example: “When ‘Organic Baby Food’ arrives *and* ‘New Bib Set’ is in stock, display a notification: ‘Perfect timing for introducing solids!’”
*   **Automated Replenishment Adjustments:** The system learns from user behavior (e.g., consistently delaying deliveries) and automatically adjusts replenishment schedules *across* related items within an Ecosystem to optimize progress.
*   **Community Ecosystem Sharing:** Allow users to share their Ecosystem designs (anonymously) with other users, fostering inspiration and best practices.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
// Data Structures
Ecosystem {
  name: string;
  items: list<Item>;
  dependencies: list<(Item, Item)>; // (dependent_item, required_item)
  progress: float; // 0.0 - 1.0
  moments: list<Moment>;
}

Moment {
  trigger_condition: function(Ecosystem) -> boolean;
  action: function();
}

// Main Loop
function UpdateEcosystems(user_events, delivery_updates) {
  for each ecosystem in user.ecosystems {
    // Update Progress based on delivery_updates and user input
    ecosystem.progress = CalculateProgress(ecosystem);

    // Check for triggered Moments
    for each moment in ecosystem.moments {
      if (moment.trigger_condition(ecosystem)) {
        moment.action();
      }
    }

    // Evaluate Dependencies
    CheckDependencyStatus(ecosystem); // Alerts user if required items are missing

    // Auto-Adjust Replenishment Schedules
    AdjustSchedules(ecosystem);
  }
}
```

**Visual Representation:** Ecosystems are visualized as interactive graphs. Nodes represent items. Links represent dependencies. Node color/size reflects progress/quantity remaining.  Dragging an item node updates the replenishment schedule.  The interface allows for zooming, panning, and filtering of Ecosystems.
