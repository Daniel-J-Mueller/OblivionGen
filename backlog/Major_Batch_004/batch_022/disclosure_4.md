## Acoustic Holography for Personalized Sound Zones

**Concept:** Expand on the time-delay aspect of the patent to create localized, dynamically adjustable “sound zones” using acoustic holography. Instead of simply attenuating noise, actively *shape* the sound field around a user.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   **Transducer Array:** High-density microphone *and* speaker array (at least 64x64 elements) integrated into a wearable (headset, collar, or spatially distributed within a room).  Each element needs individual, precise control of phase and amplitude.
    *   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated edge computing device (SoC) with a DSP and dedicated AI accelerator for real-time signal processing. Minimum 8 core processor, 16GB RAM.
    *   **Spatial Sensors:** Integrated depth sensor (e.g., time-of-flight) *and* IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for precise tracking of the user's head position and surrounding environment.  LiDAR is preferred for robust performance.
    *   **Optional:** External, fixed-position base station containing additional spatial sensors and processing power for expanded coverage and calibration.

*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Environmental Mapping:** Real-time 3D reconstruction of the surrounding environment using depth sensor data. Focus on identifying reflective surfaces and obstacles.
    2.  **Sound Source Localization:** Identify and localize all sound sources in the environment using the microphone array. Utilize beamforming and advanced sound source separation algorithms.
    3.  **Hologram Generation:**  Based on identified sound sources and the user's desired "sound zone" (defined by the user or automatically inferred based on context – e.g., focus on a conversation partner, block out office noise), generate a complex acoustic hologram. This involves calculating the precise phase and amplitude for each element in the speaker array.
    4.  **Time-Delay Compensation:** Calculate the precise time delays needed for each speaker element, accounting for distance to the user, reflections off surfaces, and desired sound field shaping.  This builds directly on the delay mechanisms in the original patent.
    5.  **Real-time Adjustment:** Continuously monitor the environment and user position, and dynamically adjust the acoustic hologram in real-time to maintain the desired sound zone.  Machine learning algorithms should be employed to predict and compensate for environmental changes.
    6.  **User Interface:**  App-based UI for defining sound zones (e.g., "focus on voice in front of me," "create a quiet bubble," "emphasize music") and adjusting parameters.

*   **Pseudocode (Hologram Generation):**

    ```
    // Input:  sound_sources (array of source locations, frequencies, amplitudes)
    //         user_location (3D coordinates)
    //         desired_sound_zone (parameters defining the zone)
    // Output: hologram (array of phase/amplitude values for each speaker element)

    function generate_hologram(sound_sources, user_location, desired_sound_zone):
        hologram = empty array
        for each speaker_element in speaker_array:
            total_contribution = 0
            for each sound_source in sound_sources:
                distance = calculate_distance(speaker_element, sound_source)
                time_delay = distance / speed_of_sound
                phase_shift = 2 * PI * frequency * time_delay
                amplitude = calculate_amplitude(speaker_element, sound_source, desired_sound_zone)
                total_contribution += amplitude * exp(j * phase_shift) // j = imaginary unit
            hologram[speaker_element] = total_contribution
        return hologram
    ```

*   **Novelty:** Moves beyond simple attenuation to *actively shape* the sound field, creating personalized audio experiences and focused listening zones.  It is a holistic system, whereas the initial patent focuses on a reactive and preventative solution.
