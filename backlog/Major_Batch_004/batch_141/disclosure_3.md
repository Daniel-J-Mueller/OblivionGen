## Dynamic Content 'Lifecycling' Based on Predicted User Engagement

**Core Concept:** Instead of solely reacting to low storage, proactively predict content disinterest based on engagement metrics, and preemptively 'lifecycle' content – shifting it to slower/cheaper storage tiers or initiating deletion – *before* it impacts free space. This moves beyond reactive deletion to a predictive, tiered storage management system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Engagement Scoring Module:**

   *   **Input:** User interaction data: Content view duration, completion rate, rewind/fast forward frequency, associated app usage during content consumption (e.g., searching for related information, sharing), time since last interaction, explicit user ratings/feedback.
   *   **Processing:** Weighted scoring algorithm.  Higher weights for explicit feedback/completion. Lower weights for passive metrics like view duration if content is long-form. Dynamically adjusted weights based on content type (video, image, document).
   *   **Output:** Engagement Score (0-100) for each content item.

**2. Predictive Tiering Engine:**

   *   **Input:** Engagement Score, Content Type, Content Age (time since download/creation), Storage Tier Costs (configurable), Available Storage Space.
   *   **Processing:** 
        *   **Tier Assignment Rules:**
            *   **Tier 1 (Fastest/Most Expensive):**  Engagement Score > 80. Content remains on fastest storage.
            *   **Tier 2 (Medium):** 50 < Engagement Score <= 80. Content moved to medium-speed storage.
            *   **Tier 3 (Slowest/Cheapest):** 20 < Engagement Score <= 50. Content moved to slowest storage or flagged for potential deletion.
            *   **Tier 4 (Deletion Candidate):** Engagement Score <= 20. Content flagged for deletion.
        *   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Rules are dynamically adjusted based on available storage.  If storage is critically low, thresholds are lowered, and more content is moved to slower tiers/flagged for deletion.
   *   **Output:** Storage Tier Assignment for each content item.

**3.  ‘Grace Period’ & Re-Engagement Mechanism:**

   *   **Function:**  When content is moved to Tier 3 or flagged for deletion, a ‘grace period’ is initiated (e.g., 7 days).
   *   **Re-Engagement Trigger:**  If the user interacts with the content *during* the grace period (views, plays, etc.), the content is immediately moved back to Tier 2 or Tier 1, and the grace period is reset.
   *   **Rationale:**  Prevents accidental deletion of content the user might still want, even if initial engagement was low.

**4. Storage Orchestration Module:**

   *   **Function:** Responsible for physically moving content between storage tiers.
   *   **Implementation:** Leverages existing storage APIs to initiate data transfer.
   *   **Optimization:** Batch transfers to minimize overhead.
   *   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and retry mechanisms.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic - Predictive Tiering Engine):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateTier(contentItem)
  engagementScore = GetEngagementScore(contentItem)
  contentAge = GetContentAge(contentItem)
  availableStorage = GetAvailableStorage()

  IF availableStorage < CRITICAL_THRESHOLD THEN
    // Aggressive Tiering
    IF engagementScore <= 30 THEN
      RETURN TIER_4 //Deletion Candidate
    ELSE IF engagementScore <= 60 THEN
      RETURN TIER_3 //Slowest Tier
    ELSE
      RETURN TIER_2
  ELSE
    // Normal Tiering
    IF engagementScore > 80 THEN
      RETURN TIER_1 //Fastest Tier
    ELSE IF engagementScore > 50 THEN
      RETURN TIER_2
    ELSE IF engagementScore > 20 THEN
      RETURN TIER_3
    ELSE
      RETURN TIER_4
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

//Example Usage
FOR EACH contentItem IN contentList
  tier = CalculateTier(contentItem)
  MoveContentToTier(contentItem, tier)
ENDFOR
```

**Novelty:**  This moves beyond reactive space management to a proactive, engagement-driven system. By predicting disinterest, it optimizes storage utilization and reduces the likelihood of deleting content the user *might* still access. The tiered system allows for balancing performance and cost based on predicted usage.
