## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System – Impact Localization & Severity

**Concept:** Integrate the camera-based impact detection system with a localized haptic feedback array on the device casing. This allows the user to *feel* where the impact occurred, and with what severity, even if the screen is off or damaged.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Array:** A dense grid of micro-actuators (piezoelectric, shape memory alloy, or electro-rheological fluid-based) embedded within the device casing – front, back, and sides. Resolution: minimum 50 actuators/100mm².
*   **Impact Mapping Algorithm:** Following impact detection (as per the provided patent), the system triangulates the impact location using camera data (feature point displacement, distortion analysis).
*   **Severity Scaling:** Algorithm assesses impact force/energy (based on camera data – speed of displacement, deformation of object in images, estimated G-force) and maps this to haptic intensity.  Intensity scales:  Low (gentle pulse), Medium (distinct vibration), High (strong, localized ‘thump’).
*   **Dynamic Haptic Profile:**  Haptic response is not uniform. Algorithm accounts for material properties of the device casing at impact location. (e.g. impact on metal will feel different than impact on plastic, even with same force).
*   **Software Integration:**  Operating system API to access impact data and trigger haptic feedback.  User-adjustable intensity levels and haptic profiles.  Optional integration with accessibility features.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On Impact Detection (from patent-based system)
function onImpactDetected(impactLocationX, impactLocationY, impactSeverity) {

    // Determine casing material at impact location
    materialType = getCasingMaterial(impactLocationX, impactLocationY);

    // Adjust haptic intensity based on material
    adjustedIntensity = adjustIntensityForMaterial(impactSeverity, materialType);

    // Activate haptic actuators around impact location
    activateHapticArray(impactLocationX, impactLocationY, adjustedIntensity);
}

function activateHapticArray(x, y, intensity) {
    // Define radius of activation around impact point
    activationRadius = 10mm;

    // Iterate over actuators within radius
    for each actuator in hapticArray {
        distance = calculateDistance(actuator.x, actuator.y, x, y);
        if (distance <= activationRadius) {
            actuator.activate(intensity * (1 – (distance / activationRadius))); // Intensity falloff
        }
    }
}

function adjustIntensityForMaterial(intensity, material) {
  if (material == "metal"){
    return intensity * 0.7;
  } else if (material == "plastic"){
    return intensity * 1.2;
  } else {
    return intensity;
  }
}

```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Damage Assessment:**  Helps users quickly identify potential damage points on the device.
*   **Security:**  Haptic ‘signature’ of impact can be recorded for forensic analysis (e.g., to determine angle of impact).
*   **Augmented Reality Interaction:**  Haptic feedback can enhance AR experiences – simulating ‘feel’ of virtual objects impacted in the real world.
*   **Improved User Experience**: Provides a subtle, but informative response to accidental drops, creating a more reassuring interaction with the device.
