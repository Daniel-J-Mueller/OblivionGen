## Adaptive Payload Composition for Subscription Events

**Concept:** Extend the timer service to dynamically compose payloads based on real-time client state *before* delivery. Instead of simply delivering a pre-defined payload at a modified time, the system retrieves and integrates data relevant to the *current* state of the subscriber, enriching the event notification.

**Specification:**

**1.  Client State Service Integration:**

    *   Introduce a "Client State Service" (CSS). This service maintains a constantly updated profile for each subscriber, including demographic data, usage patterns, active subscriptions, billing details, and preferences.
    *   The Timer Service must have API access to the CSS.

**2. Payload Composition Module (PCM):**

    *   Within the Timer Service, instantiate a "Payload Composition Module."
    *   PCM receives the original payload identifier and client identifier from the timer record.
    *   PCM queries the CSS using the client identifier to retrieve the current client state.
    *   PCM utilizes a rules engine (scripting language, e.g., Lua, Python) to define payload composition logic. These rules determine what data from the client state is appended/merged with the original payload. Rules are configurable per client or subscription type.
    *   PCM assembles the final composed payload.

**3. Timer Record Extension:**

    *   The timer record must be extended to include:
        *   `original_payload_id`: Identifier of the base payload.
        *   `composition_rules_id`: Identifier of the composition rule set to apply.
        *   `client_state_request_params`: Optional parameters to be sent to the CSS during state retrieval (e.g., specific data fields to request).

**4.  Workflow:**

    1.  Timer expires.
    2.  Timer service retrieves the `original_payload_id`, `composition_rules_id`, and `client_state_request_params` from the timer record.
    3.  Timer service queries the CSS using the client ID and `client_state_request_params` to retrieve the current client state.
    4.  Timer service utilizes the `composition_rules_id` to load the applicable composition rules.
    5.  The composition rules are applied to the client state and the original payload to create the final composed payload.
    6.  The composed payload is delivered to the destination.

**Pseudocode (PCM Module):**

```
function composePayload(timerRecord):
    originalPayloadId = timerRecord.originalPayloadId
    compositionRulesId = timerRecord.compositionRulesId
    clientStateRequestParams = timerRecord.clientStateRequestParams
    clientId = timerRecord.clientId

    clientState = CSS.getClientState(clientId, clientStateRequestParams)
    rules = RulesEngine.loadRules(compositionRulesId)
    composedPayload = RulesEngine.applyRules(rules, clientState, originalPayload)

    return composedPayload
```

**Example Rule (JSON):**

```json
{
  "rule_id": "personalization_rule_1",
  "description": "Add personalized greeting to subscription renewal notification",
  "conditions": [],
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "add_field",
      "field_name": "greeting",
      "value": "Dear {{client.name}},",
      "data_source": "client"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   Caching of client state data to reduce CSS load.
*   Asynchronous composition: Offload payload composition to a separate worker queue.
*   Shard CSS and PCM across multiple servers.
