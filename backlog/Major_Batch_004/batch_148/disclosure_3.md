## Dynamic Garment Layering & Style Mixing

**Concept:** Extend the virtual try-on experience by allowing users to dynamically layer garments and mix styles *before* generating a full rendered image. This moves beyond simple garment replacement to a true “digital styling” environment.

**Specs:**

**I. Core Functionality:**

*   **Layered Garment View:**  Instead of immediately rendering a complete image with a new garment, display a layered view where individual garment elements (e.g., shirt, jacket, scarf) are represented as distinct, interactable layers on top of the base user image.  These layers may be represented as simple outlines or low-resolution textures initially.
*   **Drag & Drop Layering:** The user can drag and drop garment previews (thumbnails) onto the base user image to add layers.  Layer order determines visual stacking (e.g., jacket over shirt).
*   **Opacity Control:**  Each layer has an adjustable opacity slider, allowing the user to partially reveal underlying layers. This facilitates style mixing (e.g., transparent jacket over a patterned shirt).
*   **Color/Texture Swapping:**  Each garment layer allows for quick color and texture swapping via a palette or library of materials.
*   **Style Presets:**  Predefined style presets (e.g., "Business Casual," "Streetwear," "Bohemian") apply a combination of layers, opacity settings, and color schemes.

**II. Rendering Pipeline:**

*   **Deferred Rendering:** Implement a deferred rendering pipeline to efficiently handle multiple layers and transparency effects.
*   **Real-time Preview:**  Provide a near real-time preview of the layered style as the user adjusts parameters.  Utilize lower resolution rendering for speed, with an option to switch to high-resolution rendering for final preview.
*   **Photorealistic Rendering:** The final rendered image should strive for photorealism, taking into account lighting, shadows, and fabric properties.
*   **Dynamic Lighting & Shadows:** Adjust lighting and shadows dynamically based on the chosen style and virtual environment.

**III. User Interface:**

*   **Layer Panel:** A dedicated layer panel displays all active garment layers, their order, opacity, and color/texture settings.
*   **Garment Library:** A browseable library of garments, categorized by type (e.g., tops, bottoms, outerwear, accessories).
*   **Virtual Environment:** A selection of virtual environments (e.g., studio, street, beach) to provide context for the rendered image.
*   **Social Sharing:**  Integration with social media platforms for easy sharing of styled looks.

**Pseudocode (Layer Management):**

```
class GarmentLayer:
  texture: Image
  opacity: float (0.0 - 1.0)
  color: Color
  z_index: int

  def apply_to_image(base_image: Image) -> Image:
    # Blend texture with base_image based on opacity and color
    # Apply appropriate blending mode (e.g., multiply, overlay)
    return blended_image

class StyleManager:
  layers: List[GarmentLayer]
  base_image: Image

  def render_style() -> Image:
    rendered_image = base_image
    for layer in sorted(layers, key=lambda x: x.z_index):
      rendered_image = layer.apply_to_image(rendered_image)
    return rendered_image

  def add_layer(layer: GarmentLayer):
    layers.append(layer)

  def remove_layer(layer: GarmentLayer):
    layers.remove(layer)

  def change_layer_order(layer: GarmentLayer, new_index: int):
    # Re-sort layers based on new index
    pass
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static garment replacement to a dynamic styling environment where users can actively layer, mix, and experiment with different styles. The layer-based approach provides a level of control and customization that is not currently available in existing virtual try-on solutions.
