## Adaptive Port Array - Specification

**Concept:** A device incorporating an array of independently extendable/retractable ports, dynamically configurable to support multiple plug types simultaneously or to present a streamlined profile when not in use. This goes beyond a single extensible port – it’s a port *matrix*.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Port Matrix:** A rectangular grid (e.g., 2x3, 3x4) of micro-ports embedded within the device housing. Each micro-port contains a miniaturized extensible mechanism similar to the patent, but with reduced travel.
*   **Shape-Shifting Interface:** Each micro-port has an internal, malleable interface capable of conforming to various plug shapes. This could utilize a combination of:
    *   Microfluidic channels filled with a magnetorheological fluid.
    *   An array of individually addressable micro-actuators (piezoelectric or MEMS).
    *   Electrostatic adhesion pads.
*   **Port Control Unit (PCU):** A dedicated microcontroller responsible for:
    *   Detecting plug insertion via force sensors in each port.
    *   Activating the appropriate micro-port extension and shape-shifting mechanisms.
    *   Managing power and data routing to the connected devices.
*   **Housing Integration:** The device housing must incorporate a flexible membrane or segmented construction over the port matrix area to accommodate the port extension and shape-shifting movements.

**Software/Firmware:**

*   **Plug Recognition Algorithm:** Software that analyzes force sensor data to identify the type of plug inserted (e.g., USB-C, 3.5mm audio, HDMI).
*   **Dynamic Pin Assignment:** The PCU intelligently assigns data and power pins within the matrix to the appropriate devices based on plug recognition.
*   **User Interface (Optional):** A software interface allowing users to manually configure port assignments or prioritize specific connections.
*   **Power Management:** A system to dynamically allocate power to connected devices based on their needs and the device’s battery level.

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  A user inserts a plug into one of the micro-ports.
2.  Force sensors detect the presence of a plug and begin analyzing the insertion force profile.
3.  The plug recognition algorithm identifies the plug type.
4.  The PCU extends the corresponding micro-port and activates the shape-shifting interface to conform to the plug’s shape.
5.  The PCU establishes a data and power connection between the plug and the device’s internal components.
6.  Multiple plugs can be connected simultaneously, with the PCU managing each connection independently.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Universal docking stations for laptops and tablets.
*   Modular smartphone accessories (cameras, speakers, game controllers).
*   Customizable interfaces for IoT devices.
*   Streamlined I/O solutions for embedded systems.
