## Automated Dependency Graph & Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Expand on the configuration change monitoring by automatically constructing and maintaining a dependency graph of all database configurations. This graph represents how each configuration setting impacts the database's functionality. Incorporate predictive rollback capabilities â€“ analyzing change patterns to predict potential failures *before* they occur and automatically revert to a known good state.

**Specs:**

*   **Dependency Graph Construction Module:**
    *   Input: Real-time stream of configuration changes. Metadata associated with each change (author, timestamp, description). Database performance metrics (latency, throughput, error rates).
    *   Process:
        1.  Parse configuration change data.
        2.  Utilize a heuristic/ML model (trained on historical data) to identify dependencies between configurations.  Dependencies are represented as directed edges in a graph database (Neo4j preferred). Node properties: configuration name, value, timestamp, author. Edge properties: dependency type (e.g., "requires", "conflicts with").
        3.  Continuously update the dependency graph as new changes occur.
    *   Output:  A dynamic dependency graph representing all database configurations and their interrelationships.
*   **Predictive Rollback Engine:**
    *   Input: Dependency graph, real-time database performance metrics, historical change logs.
    *   Process:
        1.  Monitor performance metrics *during* configuration changes.
        2.  Utilize a time-series anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to identify deviations from baseline performance.
        3.  If an anomaly is detected:
            *   Trace the impacted configurations through the dependency graph.
            *   Assess the *potential impact* of the change using the graph's relationships. Assign a risk score based on severity of impact, historical failure rate of similar changes, and confidence in the dependency relationship.
            *   If the risk score exceeds a threshold:
                *   Initiate an automated rollback sequence.
                *   Create a snapshot of the current database state.
                *   Revert to the last known good configuration (snapshot).
                *   Log the rollback event, including the root cause (configuration change), impacted services, and automated remediation steps.
    *   Output: Automated rollback of configuration changes exhibiting high risk, minimizing downtime and preventing failures.
*   **Configuration Change Simulator:**
    *   Input: Dependency graph, proposed configuration change.
    *   Process:
        1.  Simulate the proposed change on a copy of the dependency graph.
        2.  Predict the impact on other configurations using graph traversal.
        3.  Estimate the impact on database performance using a lightweight performance model (trained on historical data).
        4.  Generate a risk assessment report.
    *   Output:  Risk assessment report detailing the potential impact of a proposed configuration change. This report can be reviewed by an administrator before the change is applied.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Rollback Engine):**

```
function predictRollback(configurationChange, performanceMetrics, dependencyGraph, historicalData):
    anomalyDetected = detectAnomaly(performanceMetrics)
    if anomalyDetected:
        impactedConfigurations = traceImpact(configurationChange, dependencyGraph)
        riskScore = calculateRisk(impactedConfigurations, historicalData)
        if riskScore > threshold:
            snapshot = createSnapshot()
            revertToSnapshot(snapshot)
            logRollback(configurationChange, snapshot)
```
