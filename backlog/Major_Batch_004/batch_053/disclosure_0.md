## Adaptive Datapath Resource Allocation with Dynamic Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the pipelining approach to not just add *registers*, but dynamically allocate and deallocate *entire datapath segments* – functional units like adders, multipliers, shifters – based on real-time dataflow requirements. This moves beyond fixed pipelining to a more granular, resource-flexible approach.

**Specification:**

*   **Hardware:** A reconfigurable interconnect network (RIN) between master and servant blocks. The RIN comprises a pool of functional units (adders, multipliers, ALUs, comparators etc.). Each functional unit is individually addressable and can be dynamically routed into or out of a datapath.  Each functional unit will have a 'health' metric (latency, power consumption) to inform allocation decisions.
*   **Master Block Functionality:**
    *   **Dataflow Analysis Engine (DAE):**  Continuously monitors data arriving at the master block. The DAE profiles the operations required on the data (add, multiply, shift, compare, etc.) and estimates the computational complexity.
    *   **Resource Request Manager (RRM):** Translates the DAE’s computational needs into resource requests (e.g., "2 multipliers, 1 adder, latency < 5ns").
    *   **Dynamic Datapath Constructor (DDC):**  Receives resource allocations from the RIN and constructs the datapath in software/microcode. The DDC manages the activation and sequencing of functional units along the datapath.
*   **Servant Block Functionality:**
    *   **Data Reception & Validation:**  Verifies data integrity and signals completion to the DDC.
    *   **Result Reporting:** Communicates results back to the master block.
*   **Interconnect Network (RIN):**
    *   **Resource Pool:** A centralized (or distributed) pool of functional units.
    *   **Allocation Engine:**  Receives resource requests from the RRM and allocates resources based on availability and performance metrics. Prioritizes based on latency and power constraints.
    *   **Switching Fabric:** A high-bandwidth, low-latency switching fabric that connects functional units to datapaths.
*   **Control Flow:**
    1.  Data arrives at the Master Block.
    2.  The DAE analyzes the dataflow and generates resource requests.
    3.  The RRM sends the requests to the RIN.
    4.  The RIN allocates functional units and configures the switching fabric.
    5.  The DDC constructs the datapath in software/microcode, activating the allocated functional units.
    6.  Data flows through the datapath.
    7.  The Servant Block receives and validates the data, reporting completion.
    8.  The RIN deallocates functional units when the datapath is no longer needed.

**Pseudocode (Resource Request Manager - RRM):**

```
function requestResources(operationList, latencyConstraint, powerConstraint):
    resourceRequest = {}
    resourceRequest["operationList"] = operationList // List of required operations
    resourceRequest["latencyConstraint"] = latencyConstraint
    resourceRequest["powerConstraint"] = powerConstraint
    
    sendRequest(resourceRequest) // Send to RIN
    
    return receiveAllocation() // Receive allocation from RIN
```

**Innovation:** The key divergence from the original patent is a move from fixed pipelining (adding registers) to dynamic resource allocation.  This allows the system to adapt to varying dataflow patterns, potentially achieving higher throughput and lower latency compared to static pipelining. It facilitates fine-grained optimization for power and performance, tailored to the specific application.  It also opens doors for advanced scheduling and resource sharing strategies.
