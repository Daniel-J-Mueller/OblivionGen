**Decentralized Key Orchestration via Attestation & Ephemeral Credentials**

**Concept:** Expand the 'referral' aspect of the patent to a fully decentralized system leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and ephemeral credentials, eliminating reliance on a central key management service. Think blockchain-inspired key orchestration, but without necessarily *being* a blockchain.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** ‘Key Attestation Service’ (KAS). This isn’t a service *per se* but a distributed network adhering to a consensus protocol (e.g., Raft, or a lightweight Byzantine Fault Tolerance variant).
*   **Key Lifecycle:**
    *   **Key Generation:** Keys are generated on dedicated Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or Secure Enclaves within trusted execution environments (TEEs).
    *   **Attestation:** Each key-generating entity attests to the key’s validity and properties (algorithm, usage restrictions) via a ZK-SNARK. This proof is registered with the KAS. The proof *doesn’t* reveal the key itself, only its properties.
    *   **Ephemeral Credentials:** When a computing entity (client) requests access to a key, the KAS, based on the client’s capabilities and the key’s attested properties, issues a short-lived, cryptographically verifiable credential. This credential *doesn’t* grant direct access to the key.
*   **Key Access Protocol:**
    1.  Client requests operation requiring key ‘X’.
    2.  Client presents capabilities to KAS.
    3.  KAS verifies client capabilities against key ‘X’s attested properties.
    4.  KAS issues ephemeral credential (signed with a KAS key).
    5.  Client presents credential *and* a proof-of-work/stake (PoW/PoS) to the HSM/TEE holding the key. This proves the client legitimately obtained the credential.
    6.  HSM/TEE verifies credential signature, PoW/PoS, and *then* grants access to perform the requested cryptographic operation *without revealing the key*. The operation is performed in the HSM/TEE.
    7.  Result returned to client.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   **Attestation Record:** (Key ID, Attesting Entity ID, Algorithm, Usage Restrictions, ZK-SNARK Proof). Stored in a distributed, append-only log.
    *   **Credential:** (Client ID, Key ID, Expiration Timestamp, Signature).
*   **Pseudocode (Client Request):**

```
function requestOperation(keyId, operationData):
    credential = requestCredential(keyId)
    if credential == null:
        return error("Credential not issued")
    
    proofOfWork = generateProofOfWork()
    
    operationResult = submitToHSM(keyId, operationData, credential, proofOfWork)
    
    return operationResult
```

*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   KAS consensus mechanism must be robust against Sybil attacks.
    *   Ephemeral credential lifetimes must be short to minimize the window of opportunity for compromise.
    *   HSM/TEE must be physically and logically secured.
*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   Integration with decentralized identity (DID) frameworks.
    *   Support for attribute-based access control (ABAC).
    *   Dynamic key rotation based on usage patterns.
