## Shared Device Communication - Contextual Awareness & Proactive Notification

**Concept:** Expand beyond speaker identification to incorporate environmental context and proactively notify recipients *before* full message transmission, tailoring the notification to the perceived urgency and content type.

**Specifications:**

**1. Environmental Sensor Integration:**

*   **Hardware:** Integrate a suite of sensors into the shared device (e.g., microphone array for sound event detection, camera for object/scene recognition, accelerometer for motion detection).
*   **Data Processing:** Real-time analysis of sensor data using onboard processing or cloud-based AI. Categorize environmental events (e.g., alarm sounding, baby crying, loud music, sudden movement).

**2. Urgency & Content Type Classification:**

*   **AI Model:** Train a machine learning model (potentially leveraging existing speech-to-text & natural language understanding models) to classify both the audio content *and* the detected environmental context to determine message urgency and content type.  Example categories:
    *   **Urgency:** High (emergency, alarm), Medium (important information, request), Low (general communication, notification).
    *   **Content Type:** Voice message, alarm/alert, sound event (e.g., crying), pre-defined keyword/phrase.

**3. Proactive Notification System:**

*   **Recipient Device Integration:**  Requires a corresponding application or system-level integration on the recipient device(s).
*   **Notification Tailoring:** Based on urgency and content type, deliver tailored notifications *before* the full message is transmitted:
    *   **High Urgency:** Immediate, high-priority alert (e.g., flashing screen, loud audio, vibration). Display brief contextual information ("Alarm detected," "Baby crying").  Option to immediately accept full message or call the sender.
    *   **Medium Urgency:**  Notification with a preview of the message or a summary of the content ("New message from [Sender] - regarding [topic]").  Option to accept, postpone, or dismiss.
    *   **Low Urgency:** Standard notification with a summary.
*   **Notification Modalities:** Support multiple modalities – audio, visual, haptic – configurable per user preference.

**4. Pseudocode (Simplified Notification Flow):**

```
// On Shared Device:
audioData = captureAudio()
environmentalData = captureEnvironmentalData()
urgency, contentType = analyzeData(audioData, environmentalData)

// On Recipient Device:
receiveNotificationRequest(sender, urgency, contentType, preview)

if urgency == "High":
    displayHighPriorityAlert(preview)
    waitForUserResponse()
elif urgency == "Medium":
    displayMediumPriorityNotification(preview)
    waitForUserResponse()
else:
    displayLowPriorityNotification(preview)
```

**5. Advanced Features:**

*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system learns user preferences over time, refining the urgency and content type classification and notification tailoring.
*   **Privacy Controls:**  Allow users to control which environmental data is shared and how it is used.
*   **Multi-User Awareness:**  Recognize multiple users in the environment and tailor notifications accordingly. (e.g., if a specific user is identified as being responsible for a crying baby, notify only that user).
*    **"Do Not Disturb" Override**: Critical notifications can bypass "Do Not Disturb" mode, with user configurable parameters.
