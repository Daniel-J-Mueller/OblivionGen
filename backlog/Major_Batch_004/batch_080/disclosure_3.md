## Dynamic Log Segment Compaction & Predictive Archival

**Concept:** Extend the cumulative size tracking not just for archival purposes, but to proactively compact and reorganize log segments *before* they reach a size threshold. Introduce a predictive model to anticipate future growth rates and initiate compaction/archival *before* performance degradation occurs.

**Specs:**

*   **Log Segment Metadata Enhancement:** Add fields to existing metadata:
    *   `Growth Rate`: Historical rate of segment size increase (bytes/time unit).
    *   `Compaction Priority`:  A dynamically calculated score based on growth rate, current size, and system load. Higher priority indicates a greater need for compaction.
    *   `Predicted Segment Size`: Estimated size at a future time (configurable).
*   **Compaction Service:** A background service responsible for managing log segment compaction.
    *   Periodically scans log segment metadata.
    *   Calculates `Compaction Priority` for each segment.
    *   Triggers compaction for segments exceeding a configurable `Compaction Priority` threshold.
*   **Compaction Process:**
    1.  Identify a set of segments to compact (based on priority).
    2.  Create a new, consolidated segment.
    3.  Transfer data from the selected segments into the new segment.
    4.  Update metadata for the new segment (cumulative size, growth rate, etc.).
    5.  Mark the original segments as inactive/available for deletion.
*   **Predictive Archival:**
    *   Configure a ‘Time to Archive’ parameter.
    *   If `Predicted Segment Size` at ‘Time to Archive’ exceeds a threshold, initiate archival *before* the time elapses.
*   **Growth Rate Calculation:**
    *   Maintain a sliding window of segment size history.
    *   Calculate the rate of change (delta size / delta time).
    *   Smooth the rate using a moving average or exponential smoothing to reduce noise.
*   **System Load Awareness:**
    *   The `Compaction Priority` should be adjusted based on system load.
    *   Reduce compaction activity during peak load times to minimize impact on database performance.

**Pseudocode (Compaction Service):**

```
function runCompactionService():
    while true:
        segments = getLogSegments()
        for segment in segments:
            priority = calculateCompactionPriority(segment)
            if priority > threshold:
                compactSegment(segment)
        sleep(interval)

function calculateCompactionPriority(segment):
    growthRate = segment.growthRate
    currentSize = segment.size
    systemLoad = getCurrentSystemLoad()
    priority = (growthRate * currentSize) * (1 - systemLoad)  // Higher load reduces priority
    return priority

function compactSegment(segment):
    newSegment = createNewSegment()
    transferData(segment, newSegment)
    updateMetadata(newSegment)
    markSegmentAsInactive(segment)
```

**Rationale:** Existing systems often react to log size. This system *predicts* future size and proactively manages segments, potentially reducing latency spikes and improving overall system stability. Introducing system load awareness adds another layer of intelligence, preventing compaction from exacerbating performance issues during peak times.
