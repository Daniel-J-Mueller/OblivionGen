## Adaptive Predictive Maintenance System – ‘Chrysalis’

**Concept:** A system leveraging device state data *not* simply to indicate current status (reliable/unreliable), but to *predict* component-level failures *before* they impact overall device status. This goes beyond simple alarm states; it aims for predictive component replacement, minimizing downtime.

**System Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:** Compatible with existing device state streams (as outlined in the provided patent), augmented with high-resolution time-series data from individual component sensors (vibration, temperature, current draw, etc.).  The system will support multiple data streams – the existing “device state identifiers” alongside granular sensor data.
*   **Component Modeling:**  Each device will have a dynamic component model created based on historical data and manufacturer specifications. This model represents the expected behavior of each component under various operating conditions.  Component models are probabilistic – reflecting uncertainty in operating conditions and component degradation.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** A multi-layered anomaly detection system:
    *   **Level 1: Baseline Drift:** Detects slow, gradual changes in component behavior, indicating early signs of wear or degradation. Uses statistical process control (SPC) techniques.
    *   **Level 2: Pattern Recognition:** Uses machine learning (specifically, recurrent neural networks – RNNs) to learn ‘normal’ operating patterns for each component.  Deviations from these patterns trigger alerts.  Focus is on identifying subtle changes in signal characteristics.
    *   **Level 3:  Correlation Analysis:** Examines relationships *between* components.  A seemingly normal component may be masking a problem in another.  Causality inference algorithms will be employed to determine likely root causes.
*   **Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction:** Based on anomaly detection and historical failure data, the system calculates the RUL for each component.  RUL is expressed as a probability distribution, not a single value.
*   **Adaptive Maintenance Scheduling:** The system automatically generates maintenance schedules based on RUL predictions, prioritizing components with the highest risk of failure.  Schedules are dynamic and adjust based on real-time data and changing operating conditions.
*   **Digital Twin Integration:**  The system creates a digital twin of each device, reflecting its current state, history, and predicted future behavior. This digital twin can be used for simulation, optimization, and remote diagnostics.

**Pseudocode (RUL Calculation):**

```
function calculate_RUL(component_data, historical_failure_data):
  // component_data: time series of sensor readings for the component
  // historical_failure_data: data on past failures of similar components

  // 1. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the sensor data (e.g., mean, standard deviation, trend, frequency components)

  // 2. Anomaly Detection: Apply anomaly detection algorithms to identify deviations from normal behavior

  // 3. Degradation Modeling: Use a statistical model (e.g., Weibull distribution) to model the rate of degradation based on anomaly scores and historical data

  // 4. RUL Prediction: Calculate the probability distribution of RUL based on the degradation model

  // 5. Confidence Interval: Determine a confidence interval for the RUL prediction

  return RUL_probability_distribution, RUL_confidence_interval
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Edge Computing: Implement edge computing capabilities to pre-process sensor data and perform initial anomaly detection locally.
*   Secure Communication: Securely transmit data from edge devices to the central server using encryption and authentication protocols.
*   Scalable Infrastructure: Design a scalable infrastructure to handle large volumes of data from thousands of devices.

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple device status reporting to provide *proactive* insights into component-level health, enabling predictive maintenance and minimizing downtime.  The integration of granular sensor data, sophisticated anomaly detection algorithms, and RUL prediction provides a level of granularity and accuracy not found in existing systems. It doesn’t simply tell you *if* something is broken, but *when* it will break, allowing for planned interventions.
