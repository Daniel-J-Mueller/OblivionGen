## Electronic Device - Haptic Projection System

**Concept:** Integrate micro-robotic projection of localized haptic feedback onto the device surface, creating dynamic textural experiences for the user. This goes beyond simple vibration; it *creates* textures.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Integration:** System built *into* the device housing – specifically, a matrix of micro-robotic “pins” (100x100 resolution minimum, scalable to 200x200). Each pin is independently controlled.
*   **Pin Mechanics:** Each pin is a cylindrical actuator, constructed from a shape memory alloy (Nickel-Titanium preferred) or piezoelectric material. Stroke length: 0.5mm - 1.0mm. Diameter: 0.1mm - 0.2mm.
*   **Control System:** Dedicated microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M7 or equivalent) managing pin actuation. Communication via I2C or SPI to the device’s main processor.
*   **Surface Material:** Device surface must incorporate a flexible, durable polymer layer (e.g., polyurethane) to accommodate pin movement and maintain structural integrity.  Consider a self-healing polymer to address potential wear.
*   **Power:**  System draws peak 5W. Operates on standard 5V USB power.
*   **Software API:**  Software library providing functions to:
    *   Define haptic patterns (arrays of pin heights).
    *   Load pre-defined patterns (e.g., textures like wood, metal, fabric).
    *   Generate dynamic patterns based on user input (e.g., simulating the feel of buttons being pressed).
    *   Synchronize haptic feedback with on-screen visuals or audio.
*   **Haptic Pattern Definition:**  Pattern data stored as a 2D array representing the height of each pin (0-100, representing full extension). File format: .HPT (Haptic Pattern Template).
*   **Calibration Routine:** Automated calibration routine to compensate for manufacturing variations and ensure accurate pin positioning.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION CreateHapticPattern(patternData[][]):
    FOR each pin in pinMatrix:
        SET pinHeight = patternData[pin.x][pin.y]
        ACTUATE pin to pinHeight
    END FOR

FUNCTION LoadHapticPatternFromFile(filePath):
    READ patternData from filePath
    CALL CreateHapticPattern(patternData)

FUNCTION GenerateDynamicPattern(eventType, parameters):
    // EventType: buttonPress, sliderMove, notification, etc.
    // Parameters: specific values related to the event.

    SWITCH eventType:
        CASE buttonPress:
            CREATE pattern representing a button being pressed
            CALL CreateHapticPattern(pattern)
        CASE sliderMove:
            CREATE pattern representing slider position
            CALL CreateHapticPattern(pattern)
        CASE notification:
            CREATE pulsing pattern
            CALL CreateHapticPattern(pattern)
        DEFAULT:
            // Do nothing
    END SWITCH

FUNCTION RunCalibration():
    // Routine to calibrate pin positions
    // Use sensors to measure pin heights
    // Adjust pin control parameters to achieve accurate positioning
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Realistic button and switch simulation on touchscreen devices.
*   Enhanced gaming experiences with tactile feedback.
*   Accessibility features for visually impaired users (Braille or textural maps).
*   Realistic material simulation (simulating the feel of leather, metal, etc.).
*   Novel user interfaces with dynamic textural elements.
