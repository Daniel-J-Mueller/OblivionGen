## Dynamic Validation Context Shifting

**Concept:** Extend the randomization techniques within the HSM to not just *when* validation data is requested, but *what* validation data is requested *based on* the decrypted data itself, creating a shifting validation context. This aims to obfuscate the underlying business rules further and increase resistance to adaptive attacks.

**Specifications:**

**1. Contextual Data Extraction Module (CDEM):**

*   **Location:** Resides entirely within the dedicated cryptographic processor and dedicated memory of the HSM.
*   **Function:**  Analyzes the decrypted cleartext payment information. 
*   **Output:** Generates a “Context Vector” – a short, fixed-length data structure representing key characteristics of the transaction (e.g., transaction amount range, merchant category code, geographical region derived from billing address, time of day).  The CDEM uses a pre-defined set of rules (configurable but secured within the HSM) to map transaction features to vector components.  The vector *does not* contain sensitive PII.
*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```
    function generateContextVector(cleartextPaymentInfo):
      contextVector = new array[VECTOR_LENGTH]
      // VECTOR_LENGTH is a pre-defined constant
      
      amountRange = categorizeAmount(cleartextPaymentInfo.amount)
      merchantCategory = categorizeMerchant(cleartextPaymentInfo.merchant)
      geoRegion = determineGeoRegion(cleartextPaymentInfo.billingAddress)
      timeOfDay = categorizeTime(currentTime())

      contextVector[0] = amountRange
      contextVector[1] = merchantCategory
      contextVector[2] = geoRegion
      contextVector[3] = timeOfDay

      return contextVector
    ```

**2. Dynamic Validation Data Selector (DVDS):**

*   **Location:** Resides entirely within the dedicated cryptographic processor and dedicated memory of the HSM.
*   **Function:** Takes the Context Vector as input and selects a subset of available validation data blocks. The selection isn’t random, but *context-aware*.  A "Validation Data Map" stored within the HSM defines which validation data blocks are relevant for each context vector. This map is also configurable, allowing for adaptive rule updates without exposing the underlying rules.
*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```
    function selectValidationData(contextVector):
      relevantDataBlocks = new list()
      
      // Access the Validation Data Map (securely stored)
      validationDataMap = getValidationDataMap()
      
      // Iterate through the map and find blocks matching the context
      for each entry in validationDataMap:
        if entry.contextVector matches contextVector:
          relevantDataBlocks.add(entry.validationDataBlock)
      
      return relevantDataBlocks
    ```

**3. Modified Request Sequence:**

*   The HSM now requests validation data *based on the selected blocks from DVDS*, not in a pre-defined or fully random order.
*   Prior to requesting, a final layer of randomization shuffles the order of the selected blocks to further obfuscate the process.

**4. Bloom Filter Integration:**

*   The Bloom filter(s) remain, but they are now applied *after* the context-aware validation data is retrieved and applied. This filters out known-invalid transactions *after* a more complex, context-sensitive validation process.
*   Multiple Bloom filters may be used, each tailored to a specific context vector category.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The Validation Data Map and Bloom filter data are encrypted at rest and in transit within the HSM.
*   The CDEM's ruleset and DVDS's mapping are updatable, but only through a secure, audited process.
*   Performance must be carefully considered. The CDEM and DVDS should be highly optimized to minimize latency.
