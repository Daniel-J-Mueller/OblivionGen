## Dynamic Workspace Illumination & Task Guidance

**System Overview:** A wearable system augmenting the existing technology with dynamically projected workspace illumination and contextual task guidance beyond simple instruction display. This aims to reduce cognitive load and improve pick/pack/ship efficiency by highlighting resources *and* guiding physical actions.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Wearable Unit:** Lightweight head-mounted display (HMD) with wide field-of-view. Incorporates:
    *   High-resolution micro-projector capable of projecting both text/graphics *and* structured light patterns.
    *   Depth sensor (Time-of-Flight or Structured Light) for real-time workspace mapping.
    *   High-resolution RGB camera for object/barcode recognition and environmental context.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for head tracking.
    *   Wireless communication module (WiFi 6E/Bluetooth 5.3).
*   **Workspace Beacons:** Ultra-Wideband (UWB) beacons strategically placed throughout the workspace to provide precise location data.
*   **Central Server:** Cloud-based server for task management, data analysis, and instruction generation.

**Software Architecture:**

1.  **Workspace Mapping & Calibration:** Upon startup, the depth sensor scans the workspace, creating a 3D map. UWB beacon data is used for precise location calibration.
2.  **Task Assignment & Instruction Generation:** The central server assigns tasks to the worker and generates a sequence of instructions based on item attributes, shipping requirements, and available resources.
3.  **Resource Highlighting:** The system identifies relevant resources (items, containers, labels, etc.) within the workspace using computer vision and UWB data. These resources are then *illuminated* with dynamically projected light patterns:
    *   **Resource Glow:** A soft, colored glow highlights the target resource. The color indicates the type of action required (e.g., green for pick, red for place, blue for scan).
    *   **Projection Pathing:**  A dynamic, projected line guides the worker's hand along the optimal path to reach the target resource.
    *   **Dynamic Occlusion Handling:** If a resource is obscured, the system projects an outline or “phantom” view of the obscured object, aiding visual acquisition.
4.  **Action Guidance:**  The system doesn't just display *what* to do, but *how* to do it:
    *   **Projected Motion Guides:** For tasks requiring specific movements (e.g., sealing a box, applying a label), the system projects a visual guide directly onto the workspace, demonstrating the correct motion.  This uses the depth sensor to understand the worker's hand position and adjusts the guide accordingly.
    *   **Force Feedback Augmentation:** In conjunction with lightweight haptic gloves, the system can project "virtual barriers" that provide gentle resistance when the worker's hand approaches a hazardous area or incorrect position.
5.  **Real-Time Adaptation:**  The system continuously monitors the worker’s actions using the camera and IMU. It adjusts the projected guidance in real-time based on their movements and adapts to unexpected events (e.g., an item being moved, an obstruction appearing).

**Pseudocode (Action Guidance Loop):**

```
loop:
    // Get worker's head and hand position from IMU and camera.
    workerHeadPosition = getHeadPosition();
    workerHandPosition = getHandPosition();

    // Get current instruction from task list.
    currentInstruction = getNextInstruction();

    // Determine target resource for instruction.
    targetResource = currentInstruction.targetResource;

    // Calculate vector from worker's hand to target resource.
    directionVector = targetResource.position - workerHandPosition;

    // Project a visual guide (e.g., a line or arrow) from worker's hand
    // along the direction vector onto the workspace.
    projectGuidance(directionVector);

    // If instruction requires a specific motion, generate a visual demonstration
    // of the motion and project it onto the workspace.
    if (currentInstruction.motionRequired) {
        generateMotionGuide(currentInstruction.motionData);
        projectMotionGuide();
    }

    // Continuously monitor worker's hand position and adjust the guidance
    // in real-time.

    // If worker completes the instruction, receive acknowledgment and
    // proceed to the next instruction.

end loop
```

**Innovation:** The key innovation is moving beyond passive instruction display to *active* guidance. By combining projected illumination, visual pathing, and real-time motion guidance, the system aims to significantly reduce cognitive load, improve efficiency, and minimize errors in complex pick/pack/ship operations.  The depth sensing and motion tracking capabilities allow for a highly adaptable and personalized user experience.
