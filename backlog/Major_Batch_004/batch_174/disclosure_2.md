## Dynamic Animation Layering with Predictive Transitioning

**Concept:** Expand upon the state machine-driven collision resolution by introducing a layered animation system *before* collisions occur, coupled with predictive transition algorithms. Instead of reacting *to* collisions, the system anticipates potential conflicts and proactively adjusts animation layers to minimize or eliminate them.

**Specs:**

**1. Animation Layer Definition:**

*   Each animation is defined not just by states, but by a 'layer' property (Integer). Lower layer numbers have higher priority (render first, potentially occluding higher layers).
*   Each animation also has a 'blend mode' property (e.g., additive, multiplicative, overlay).
*   Animations declare 'compatibility rules' – conditions under which they can coexist on the same element without visual artifacts. These are boolean expressions using element properties and other animation metadata.

**2. Predictive Transition Algorithm:**

*   A 'transition manager' monitors pending animation requests.
*   For each pending animation, the transition manager queries the compatibility rules of currently playing animations on the target element.
*   If a conflict is predicted, the algorithm evaluates potential ‘transition strategies’:
    *   **Layer Adjustment:** Temporarily re-assign layers to minimize conflict (raising or lowering priority).
    *   **Blending Modification:** Adjust blend modes to mitigate visual clashes.
    *   **Partial Cancellation/Modification:** Briefly interrupt or modify existing animations to create space for the incoming one.
    *   **Preemptive Transition:** Begin a smooth transition *out* of the current animation *before* the new one starts, minimizing jarring changes.
*   The transition manager assigns a 'cost' to each strategy (based on visual disruption, execution time, etc.).
*   The strategy with the lowest cost is selected.

**3. State Machine Integration:**

*   The state machine is extended with 'transition states'.  These states handle the execution of the selected transition strategy.
*   When a potential collision is detected, the state machine transitions to the appropriate transition state.
*   The transition state executes the transition strategy, adjusting animation layers, blend modes, and initiating transitions.
*   Once the transition is complete, the state machine resumes normal animation execution.

**4. Pseudocode (Transition Manager):**

```
function evaluate_transition_strategies(pending_animation, current_animations):
  strategies = []

  # Layer Adjustment
  for layer in range(1, MAX_LAYERS + 1):
    if layer is not used by current_animations:
      strategies.append({"type": "layer_adjustment", "layer": layer, "cost": 10})

  # Blending Modification
  for blend_mode in ["additive", "multiplicative", "overlay"]:
    strategies.append({"type": "blend_modification", "blend_mode": blend_mode, "cost": 5})

  # Partial Cancellation/Modification
  strategies.append({"type": "partial_cancellation", "cost": 20})

  # Preemptive Transition
  strategies.append({"type": "preemptive_transition", "cost": 15})

  # Apply compatibility rules & refine costs
  for strategy in strategies:
    if not is_compatible(strategy, pending_animation, current_animations):
      strategy["cost"] = 1000  # Disqualify incompatible strategies

  # Sort by cost
  strategies.sort(key=lambda x: x["cost"])

  return strategies[0] # Return the lowest cost strategy
```

**5.  Data Structures:**

*   `AnimationLayer`:  `{id: int, layer: int, blend_mode: string, states: [State], compatibility_rules: [Rule]}`
*   `State`: `{name: string, duration: float, animation_data: [float]}`
*   `Rule`: `{condition: string, result: boolean}`

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Smoother animation transitions.
*   Reduced visual artifacts during animation collisions.
*   More complex and layered animations.
*   Proactive collision management, improving performance.
