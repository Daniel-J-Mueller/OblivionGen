## Dynamic Content Layering with Predictive Affinity

**Concept:** Extend the layered content display concept to dynamically predict user affinity *during* content consumption, preemptively layering relevant supplementary content before explicit interaction. This moves beyond reactive layering to proactive enhancement.

**Specifications:**

**1. Affinity Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Real-time user interaction data (reading speed, pauses, selections, scrolling behavior, time of day, location data – opt-in only), content metadata (genre, topic, author, sentiment analysis), historical user preferences, aggregated anonymized user behavior patterns.
*   **Algorithm:** Hybrid approach.
    *   **Collaborative Filtering:** Identify users with similar reading/consumption patterns.
    *   **Content-Based Filtering:** Analyze content features and match them to user preferences.
    *   **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):** Train an RNN to predict user interest based on sequential interaction data (e.g., reading a paragraph, selecting a word).
*   **Output:**  A dynamically updated "Affinity Score" for each available supplementary content application. This score represents the probability that the user will find the application’s content relevant at this specific moment.

**2. Dynamic Layer Management:**

*   **Layer Priority:** Based on Affinity Score. Applications with higher scores are prioritized for layering.
*   **Layer Types:**
    *   **Information Layers:** Definitions, translations, historical context, related articles.
    *   **Engagement Layers:** Polls, quizzes, challenges related to the content.
    *   **Creative Layers:** Alternative interpretations, fan fiction excerpts, artwork inspired by the content.
    *   **Commerce Layers:** Links to related products, services, or authors.
*   **Layer Display Rules:**
    *   **Transparency:** Adjustable layer transparency to balance supplementary content with the primary content.
    *   **Positioning:**  Dynamic positioning of layers (e.g., footnotes, sidebars, overlaid text).
    *   **Timing:**  Preemptive layering based on predicted user interest, triggered by specific events (e.g., reaching a certain point in the content, encountering a difficult term).
*   **User Control:**
    *   **Layer Selection:**  Allow users to explicitly enable or disable specific layer types.
    *   **Sensitivity Adjustment:**  Allow users to adjust the sensitivity of the predictive algorithm (e.g., “Show more/less proactive suggestions”).

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Content Enhancement Module (as in the patent):** Modified to integrate the Affinity Prediction Engine.
*   **Application Platform:** Hosts supplementary content applications.
*   **Data Pipeline:** Collects user interaction data, content metadata, and historical preferences.
*   **Machine Learning Infrastructure:**  Trains and deploys the Affinity Prediction Engine.
*   **API:** Enables communication between modules.

**4. Pseudocode (Affinity Prediction & Layer Management):**

```
// On User Interaction Event (e.g., Page Turn, Text Selection)
function processInteraction(interactionData, contentMetadata, userProfile) {

    affinityScores = AffinityPredictionEngine.predict(interactionData, contentMetadata, userProfile);

    prioritizedApps = sortAppsByAffinityScore(affinityScores);

    // Select top N apps for layering (e.g., N = 2-3)
    selectedApps = prioritizedApps.slice(0, N);

    // Request content from selected apps
    supplementaryContent = requestContent(selectedApps);

    // Layer supplementary content onto primary content
    displayContent(primaryContent, supplementaryContent);
}

// Function to request content
function requestContent(apps) {
    // API call to apps for relevant content
    content = apps.getRelevantContent();
    return content;
}
```

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond reactive layering to *proactive* content enhancement. The system anticipates user needs and layers relevant supplementary content before the user explicitly requests it, creating a more immersive and engaging experience. The dynamic adjustment of layer priority based on real-time user behavior and predictive algorithms is a key differentiating factor.
