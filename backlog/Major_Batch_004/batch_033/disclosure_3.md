## Dynamic Ambient Lighting Integration

**Concept:** Extend the voice-controlled device's influence beyond the AV display to encompass and dynamically control ambient lighting within the user's environment, creating a fully immersive experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Integrated Zigbee/Thread radio within the voice-controlled device.
    *   Support for a wide range of smart lighting protocols (Philips Hue, LIFX, Nanoleaf, etc.).
    *   Optional IR blaster expansion port for legacy lighting control.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Lighting Profile Database:**  A cloud-hosted database associating content (movies, TV shows, music) with optimized lighting profiles (color temperature, brightness, patterns).
    *   **Scene Creation Engine:** Allow users to create and customize lighting scenes tailored to specific activities or moods. Voice commands should include scene creation options ("Create a 'Cozy Reading' scene with warm white light at 20% brightness").
    *   **Dynamic Lighting Algorithm:** Analyze incoming audio/video streams (using onboard processing or cloud analysis) to dynamically adjust ambient lighting. This includes:
        *   **Color Extraction:** Identify dominant colors in video frames and replicate them in ambient lighting.
        *   **Sound Synchronization:** Sync lighting effects (e.g., flickering, pulsing) to sounds in the content (explosions, music beats).
        *   **Mood Detection:** (Advanced) Leverage AI to analyze content mood (e.g., suspenseful, romantic) and automatically adjust lighting accordingly.
    *   **Voice Command Integration:** Expand voice command vocabulary to include full lighting control:
        *   "Set the lights to Movie Mode."
        *   "Dim the lights to 50%."
        *   "Change the lights to blue."
        *   "Sync the lights to the music."
        *   "Create a relaxing scene."
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   Voice-controlled device acts as a central hub, managing communication between content source, AV display, and smart lighting system.
    *   Utilize a low-latency communication protocol (e.g., Thread, Zigbee) for near-real-time lighting adjustments.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Lighting Adjustment):**

```
function adjustLighting(frame, audioData):
  // Extract dominant colors from frame
  colors = extractDominantColors(frame)

  // Analyze audio data for key events (explosions, music beats)
  events = analyzeAudio(audioData)

  // Determine lighting adjustments based on colors and events
  brightness = calculateBrightness(colors, events)
  colorTemperature = calculateColorTemperature(colors, events)
  effects = determineLightingEffects(events)

  // Send commands to smart lighting system
  sendCommand(brightness)
  sendCommand(colorTemperature)
  sendEffectCommand(effects)
```

**Novelty:**  While current smart lighting systems can be controlled via voice commands, this system proactively integrates lighting adjustments *based on content analysis*, creating a truly immersive and dynamic experience.  The dynamic algorithm and integration with content streams differentiate it from static scene-setting approaches.
