## Dynamic Forum 'Echos' & Sentiment-Driven Thread Weighting

**Concept:** Expand the idea of forum creation based on search terms to include *dynamic* forum creation based on emerging topics *within* search results and weighting forum threads based on real-time sentiment analysis of user contributions.  Essentially, create “echoes” of the overall search topic, refined by user interaction.

**Specification:**

**1. Echo Forum Generation:**

*   **Trigger:** When a search yields results exceeding a predefined threshold (e.g., 100 results), initiate ‘Echo’ forum generation.  Instead of *only* using the initial search string, analyze the top N results (e.g., N=20) for frequently occurring entities (people, places, things) using Named Entity Recognition (NER).
*   **Entity Prioritization:** Assign a ‘relevance score’ to each identified entity based on its frequency *and* position within the top results (entities appearing in titles/first paragraphs are weighted higher).
*   **Echo Creation:**  Generate a new forum for each entity exceeding a predetermined relevance threshold.  The forum title is derived from the entity name, potentially with clarifying context (e.g., “Apple – iPhone 15 Discussion” instead of just “Apple”).
*   **Seed Content:** Populate the Echo forum with a summary of the top search results pertaining to that entity, and automatically seed initial discussion threads (e.g., “What are your first impressions of the new [Entity]?”).

**2. Sentiment-Driven Thread Weighting:**

*   **Real-time Sentiment Analysis:** Implement a sentiment analysis engine (using NLP models) to evaluate each post within all forums (search forums, Echo forums, category/tag forums).  Assign a sentiment score (e.g., -1 to +1) to each post.
*   **Thread Score Calculation:**  Calculate a thread score based on the average sentiment of all posts within that thread.  Apply a weighting factor to recent posts (more recent contributions have a higher impact on the score).
*   **Dynamic Thread Ordering:**  Order threads within each forum based on their sentiment score.  Threads with higher (positive) sentiment are displayed higher in the list.  Consider separate filters for “Most Positive”, “Most Negative”, and “Most Active” (regardless of sentiment).
*   **‘Heatmap’ Visualization:**  Introduce a visual ‘heatmap’ overlay on the thread list, color-coding threads based on their sentiment score (e.g., green = positive, red = negative, gray = neutral).

**3. Cross-Forum Linking & Recommendation:**

*   **Entity Recognition in Posts:**  Run NER on all posts across all forums.  Identify entities mentioned in the post.
*   **Dynamic Link Generation:**  Automatically generate links to relevant forums (including Echo forums) based on the entities mentioned.  For example, if a user mentions “Samsung Galaxy S23” in a thread about iPhone 15, display a link to the “Samsung Galaxy S23” Echo forum.
*   **Personalized Forum Recommendations:**  Based on a user’s browsing history and forum participation, recommend relevant forums (including Echo forums) to them.

**Pseudocode (Forum Recommendation):**

```
function recommend_forums(user_id):
  user_history = get_user_history(user_id)  // Browsing & Forum Posts
  relevant_entities = extract_entities(user_history) // Use NER

  candidate_forums = []
  for entity in relevant_entities:
    forum = find_forum_by_entity(entity)
    if forum:
      candidate_forums.append(forum)

  //Sort by user interaction count (posts/views)
  sorted_forums = sort_forums_by_user_interaction(candidate_forums, user_id)

  return top_n(sorted_forums, 5) //Return Top 5 Forums
```

**Engineer Considerations:**

*   Scalability of NER and sentiment analysis across a large volume of posts.
*   Real-time processing of posts for sentiment analysis and dynamic thread ordering.
*   Efficient indexing and search of forums and threads based on entities.
*   Development of a user-friendly interface for filtering and sorting threads based on sentiment.
