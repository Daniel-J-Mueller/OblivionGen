## Dynamic Haptic Feedback System – ‘Echo’

**Core Concept:** Extend the visual ‘firefly’ effect into the haptic space, creating a localized, directional tactile experience. Rather than *only* visually indicating recognized objects, the system provides subtle, dynamically changing haptic feedback to the user’s hand or fingers.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Haptic Glove/Sleeve:** A lightweight, flexible glove or sleeve equipped with an array of micro-actuators (e.g., piezoelectric, shape memory alloy) capable of generating localized pressure, vibration, or temperature changes.  Focus on fingertip and palm actuation.
*   **Proximity Sensor Array:**  Embedded in the glove/sleeve, detects the user’s hand position and orientation relative to the display/environment.
*   **Processing Unit:** Handles sensor data, object recognition results, and haptic feedback signal generation.  Low-latency is critical.
*   **Integration with Camera/Sensor Data:**  The system relies on the existing camera/sensor data stream from the patented device.

**Software/Logic:**

1.  **Object Recognition Correlation:**  When the object recognition algorithm identifies an object, the system maps that object's spatial position to the user’s hand. This establishes a “target” location on the glove/sleeve.
2.  **Haptic ‘Emanation’:**  Upon activation (physical button press in the patent), the haptic actuators begin a localized, spreading pattern of stimulation, mimicking the visual firefly ‘emanating’ from the button.  Start with a strong pulse near the ‘button location’ on the glove.
3.  **Dynamic Haptic Mapping:**
    *   **Proximity-Based Intensity:** As the user’s hand approaches the recognized object (detected by proximity sensors), the intensity of the haptic stimulation *increases* at the corresponding location on the glove.
    *   **Object Size/Complexity:** The *spatial extent* of the haptic stimulation corresponds to the size/complexity of the recognized object. A larger object results in a broader area of stimulation on the glove.
    *   **Movement Tracking:** If the recognized object is moving, the haptic stimulation dynamically shifts across the glove surface to track the object’s movement, providing a sense of “touching” the moving object.
    *   **Material Property Simulation:** (Advanced) Attempt to simulate the material properties of the recognized object.  E.g., a rough surface = rapid, irregular pulsations.  A smooth surface = consistent, gentle pressure.
4.  **Haptic ‘Dispersal’ & Return:** When the object moves out of view, the haptic stimulation gradually diminishes and disperses across the glove surface.  Another button press returns the stimulation to the starting location.
5. **Haptic 'Ghosting':**  If an object is *partially* obscured, the haptic feedback diminishes accordingly.  This could simulate 'feeling around' an object behind a barrier.

**Pseudocode Example (Simplified):**

```
// Variables
float objectX, objectY, objectZ;       // Object position in 3D space
float handX, handY, handZ;             // User's hand position
int hapticActuatorArray[100];         // Array representing haptic actuators
float intensityMultiplier = 1.0;

// Function: UpdateHapticFeedback()
function UpdateHapticFeedback(objectX, objectY, objectZ, handX, handY, handZ) {

  // Calculate distance between object and hand
  float distance = sqrt(pow(objectX - handX, 2) + pow(objectY - handY, 2) + pow(objectZ - handZ, 2));

  // Calculate intensity based on distance (attenuation)
  intensityMultiplier = 1.0 / (distance + 1.0); // Add 1 to avoid division by zero.

  // Determine actuator location based on object position.  (Simplified: assume 1:1 mapping)
  int actuatorIndex = calculateActuatorIndex(objectX, objectY);

  // Update actuator intensity.
  hapticActuatorArray[actuatorIndex] = min(1.0, intensityMultiplier * objectSizeFactor);

  //Send actuator data to haptic hardware.
  sendHapticData(hapticActuatorArray);
}

//Function: calculateActuatorIndex(x, y)
//  Calculates the appropriate actuator index based on 2D coordinates. (Implementation depends on hardware.)
//  This is a placeholder.

//Function: sendHapticData(actuatorArray)
//  Sends the actuator data to the haptic hardware. (Implementation depends on hardware.)
//  This is a placeholder.
```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   **Multi-Sensor Integration:** Combine camera data with other sensors (e.g., depth sensors, microphones) to enhance object recognition and haptic feedback.
*   **Personalized Haptic Profiles:** Allow users to customize the intensity, frequency, and pattern of haptic feedback to suit their preferences.
*   **Haptic Learning:**  Use machine learning to adapt the haptic feedback based on user interactions and feedback.
*   **Remote Haptic Interaction:**  Extend the system to allow users to remotely "touch" and interact with objects in a virtual environment.
