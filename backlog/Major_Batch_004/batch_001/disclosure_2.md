## Dynamic Fragment Sharding & Predictive Repair

**Concept:** Extend erasure coding to proactively shard fragments across heterogeneous storage tiers *and* predict/pre-compute replacements for failing fragments before failure is detected. This is about building a self-healing, performance-optimized data layer, not just reliability.

**Specifications:**

**1. Tiered Storage Mapping:**

*   **Input:** Define a set of storage tiers (SSD, NVMe, HDD, Tape, Cloud Object Storage – varying cost, latency, capacity). Assign each tier a 'health score' (based on SMART data, access patterns, etc.).
*   **Mapping Algorithm:** Develop an algorithm to map erasure coding fragments to tiers based on:
    *   **Fragment Importance:** Calculate a 'reconstruction cost' for each fragment. Fragments critical to fast recovery (e.g., metadata) get priority on faster tiers.
    *   **Tier Capacity & Health:** Dynamically adjust fragment placement to maximize capacity utilization *and* health. Avoid concentrating critical fragments on failing tiers.
    *   **Access Frequency:** Frequently accessed fragments get tiered closer to compute.
*   **Data Structure:** A tiered fragment map storing fragment ID, tier location, health score of the tier, and last access time.

**2. Predictive Fragment Replication:**

*   **Failure Prediction:** Implement a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM) trained on historical fragment access patterns, tier health scores, and environmental factors (temperature, power). The model predicts the probability of fragment failure within a defined timeframe.
*   **Pre-Computation:** When a fragment’s failure probability exceeds a threshold:
    *   **Initiate Reconstruction:** Trigger a background reconstruction of the fragment using the remaining erasure-coded data.
    *   **Tiered Placement:** Place the newly reconstructed fragment on a healthy tier *before* the predicted failure occurs.
*   **Redundancy Level:**  Allow administrators to configure a 'proactive redundancy' level. Higher levels increase pre-computation but reduce recovery time.

**3. Dynamic Sharding & Load Balancing:**

*   **Fragment Splitting:** Divide large fragments into smaller 'shards'.
*   **Shard Placement:** Distribute shards across multiple tiers and servers for parallel access.
*   **Load Balancing:** Monitor shard access patterns and dynamically re-shard/re-place shards to balance load across tiers and servers.

**4. Pseudocode (Predictive Replication):**

```
function predict_fragment_failure(fragment_id):
  input: fragment_id
  output: failure_probability

  # Fetch historical data: access patterns, tier health, environmental factors
  data = get_historical_data(fragment_id)

  # Run ML model
  failure_probability = ml_model.predict(data)

  return failure_probability

function replicate_fragment(fragment_id):
  input: fragment_id

  # Get remaining fragments for reconstruction
  remaining_fragments = get_remaining_fragments(fragment_id)

  # Reconstruct fragment
  new_fragment = reconstruct_fragment(fragment_id, remaining_fragments)

  # Find healthiest tier
  target_tier = find_healthiest_tier()

  # Store new fragment on target tier
  store_fragment(new_fragment, target_tier)

  return True

function monitor_and_replicate():
  for fragment_id in all_fragments:
    failure_probability = predict_fragment_failure(fragment_id)
    if failure_probability > threshold:
      replicate_fragment(fragment_id)
```

**5. System Components:**

*   **Monitoring Agent:** Collects tier health data, access patterns, and environmental factors.
*   **Prediction Engine:** Runs the machine learning model to predict fragment failures.
*   **Reconstruction Manager:** Coordinates fragment reconstruction and placement.
*   **Tiered Storage Interface:** Abstracts the underlying storage tiers.
*   **API:** Allows applications to access erasure-coded data with performance optimization.
