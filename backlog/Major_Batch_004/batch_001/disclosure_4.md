## Personalized Acoustic Environment Modeling

**Concept:** Leverage on-device learning and remote aggregation to create a personalized acoustic environment model for each user. This model isn’t about *understanding* speech better, but about *enhancing* the audio input to be clearer *before* speech processing even begins, based on the user's typical soundscape.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Profiling:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Utilize device microphones *and* potentially other sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope) to capture not just speech, but the ambient acoustic environment.
*   **Profiling Mode:**  Initiate a “profiling” mode where the device passively records audio for a period (user configurable, default 24 hours).
*   **Sound Event Detection (SED):** Implement on-device SED to categorize dominant sound events (e.g., traffic, music, keyboard clicks, HVAC). The SED model should be relatively lightweight for on-device execution.
*   **Acoustic Fingerprint Generation:**  For each detected sound event, generate an “acoustic fingerprint” – a feature vector representing the spectral characteristics, duration, and temporal patterns of the event.
*   **User Acoustic Profile (UAP):**  Aggregate acoustic fingerprints to create a UAP. This profile represents the typical soundscape of the user. Include timestamps and location data (optional, user consent required) to further refine the model.

**2. Real-time Audio Enhancement:**

*   **Input Audio Analysis:** When speech is detected, analyze the input audio stream in real-time.
*   **Sound Event Recognition (SER):**  Utilize a SER model (potentially sharing weights with the SED model) to identify ambient sound events present in the current audio stream.
*   **Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC):**  Based on the identified ambient sound events and the UAP, apply adaptive noise cancellation techniques.  This goes beyond standard ANC by *modeling* the specific acoustic characteristics of the user’s environment. For example, if the UAP indicates frequent traffic noise, the ANC will be tuned to specifically attenuate those frequencies and patterns.
*   **Acoustic Environment Simulation (AES):**  To further enhance clarity, *simulate* the impact of removing the identified sound events on the speech signal. This involves estimating the spectral characteristics of the speech signal *without* the interfering sound events. The goal isn't perfect removal, but a more natural and intelligible audio experience.

**3. Federated Learning & Model Improvement:**

*   **Difference Data Transmission:** As in the original patent, transmit data representing differences between the initial acoustic model and the enhanced acoustic model to a remote server. This focuses on *acoustic environment* model differences, not speech recognition model differences.
*   **Federated Averaging:** The remote server aggregates difference data from multiple users. Federated averaging creates an improved, generalized acoustic environment model.
*   **Model Distribution:** The improved model is distributed back to user devices as updates to the on-device acoustic models.

**Pseudocode (On-Device):**

```
// Initialization
Load initial acoustic model

Retrieve corresponding fingerprints from UAP
Apply adaptive noise cancellation based on fingerprints
Simulate acoustic environment without interfering sounds
Enhance speech signal
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:**  Minimize data transmission. Focus on transmitting model *differences*, not raw audio data.
*   **Computational Cost:** Optimize algorithms for on-device execution.  Use lightweight models and efficient signal processing techniques.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to manually adjust the acoustic enhancement settings.
*   **Multi-Modal Integration:**  Combine audio data with other sensor data (e.g., accelerometer) to improve the accuracy of sound event detection and noise cancellation.
*   **Acoustic Scene Classification:** Implement acoustic scene classification to automatically adjust the noise cancellation settings based on the detected environment (e.g., office, home, car).
