## Real-Time Emotional State Visualization Overlay

**Concept:** Extend the user behavior visualization to incorporate *predicted* emotional state, visualized as an overlay on the user’s “indicium” (the point/dot representing them). This goes beyond simply tracking *what* a user does, and attempts to visualize *how* they feel while doing it.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:** Integrate with APIs providing sentiment analysis from various sources. Potential sources:
    *   **Keystroke Dynamics:** Analyze typing speed, pressure, and pauses.
    *   **Mouse Movement:** Track speed, acceleration, and patterns.
    *   **Webcam (Optional):** Facial expression analysis (with user consent, privacy prioritized).
    *   **Audio Input (Optional):** Vocal tone analysis (with user consent, privacy prioritized).
    *   **Content Analysis:** Sentiment scoring of user-generated text (e.g., chat messages, form inputs).
*   **Emotional State Mapping:**
    *   Define a core set of emotional states (e.g., Happy, Frustrated, Confused, Neutral, Anxious).
    *   Develop a scoring system based on combined data from input sources.  Each input source contributes a weighted score to each emotional state. Weights adjustable via configuration.
    *   Employ a smoothing algorithm (e.g., moving average) to reduce erratic fluctuations in emotional state.
*   **Visualization Overlay:**
    *   The user’s indicium changes color and/or shape to represent their predicted emotional state.
        *   Example:
            *   Green = Happy
            *   Red = Frustrated
            *   Yellow = Confused
            *   Blue = Neutral
            *   Purple = Anxious
    *   Optional: Add a subtle pulsating effect to the indicium, with the pulsation rate and intensity reflecting the *intensity* of the emotional state.
    *   The visualization should be configurable; users can enable/disable the emotional state overlay and customize the color scheme.
*   **Data Processing Pipeline:**
    ```pseudocode
    function process_user_data(user_id, keystroke_data, mouse_data, webcam_data, content_data):
      keystroke_score = analyze_keystroke_dynamics(keystroke_data)
      mouse_score = analyze_mouse_movement(mouse_data)
      webcam_score = analyze_facial_expressions(webcam_data)
      content_score = analyze_text_sentiment(content_data)

      emotional_scores = {
        "Happy": 0,
        "Frustrated": 0,
        "Confused": 0,
        "Neutral": 0,
        "Anxious": 0
      }

      emotional_scores["Happy"] += keystroke_score.happy + mouse_score.happy + webcam_score.happy + content_score.happy
      emotional_scores["Frustrated"] += keystroke_score.frustrated + mouse_score.frustrated + webcam_score.frustrated + content_score.frustrated
      emotional_scores["Confused"] += keystroke_score.confused + mouse_score.confused + webcam_score.confused + content_score.confused
      emotional_scores["Neutral"] += keystroke_score.neutral + mouse_score.neutral + webcam_score.neutral + content_score.neutral
      emotional_scores["Anxious"] += keystroke_score.anxious + mouse_score.anxious + webcam_score.anxious + content_score.anxious

      predicted_emotion = find_max_emotion(emotional_scores)

      return predicted_emotion
    ```
*   **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   All optional data collection (webcam, audio) requires explicit user consent.
    *   Data is processed locally whenever possible.
    *   Data retention policies are clearly defined and communicated to users.
    *   Anonymization/pseudonymization techniques are employed where appropriate.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Usability Testing:** Identify points of frustration for users navigating a website or application.
*   **Customer Support:** Prioritize support requests based on user emotional state (e.g., escalate requests from frustrated users).
*   **Personalized Experiences:** Adapt content or interface based on user emotional state.
*   **Accessibility:**  Provide tailored assistance to users who are struggling or confused.
