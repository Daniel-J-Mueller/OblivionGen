## Dynamic Room Persona Generation & Predictive Layout

**Concept:** Extend the system to not just *recommend* layouts, but to dynamically generate ‘room personas’ representing likely inhabitant lifestyles and preferences, influencing layout generation *before* any user input. This allows for hyper-personalized and proactive layout suggestions.

**Specs:**

1.  **Persona Database:** Create a database of room personas. Each persona is defined by a vector of attributes:
    *   `AgeRange`: (e.g., 25-35, 60+)
    *   `FamilyStatus`: (e.g., Single, Couple, Family with young children, Empty Nester)
    *   `Hobbies`: (e.g., Gaming, Cooking, Reading, Home Office, Exercise) - Represented as a weighted list.
    *   `WorkStyle`: (e.g., Remote, Hybrid, Office-Based, Retired)
    *   `AestheticPreference`: (e.g., Minimalist, Modern, Rustic, Bohemian) – Categorical or tag-based.
    *   `SocialActivity`: (e.g., Frequent Guests, Solitary, Moderate)
    *   `PetOwnership`: (Boolean, Type of Pet)

2.  **Environmental Data Input:** The system ingests additional environmental data to refine persona prediction:
    *   **Location Data:** Geographic location influences lifestyle (urban vs. rural, climate, etc.).
    *   **Building Type:** (Apartment, House, Condo)
    *   **Room Type:** (Living Room, Bedroom, Kitchen)

3.  **Persona Prediction Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., a Bayesian network or a neural network) predicts the most likely room persona based on the combined environmental data and user profile (if available – optional).

4.  **Predictive Layout Generation:**  The system uses the predicted room persona to inform layout generation *before* the user provides any specific input.
    *   Each persona is associated with a set of 'layout templates' and furniture preferences. These templates define general layout strategies (e.g., a ‘family living room’ prioritizes seating and play space).
    *   The system generates a *probability distribution* over possible layouts based on the persona. This allows for a range of suggestions.

5.  **Layout Refinement Loop:**  The user can then interact with the generated layouts. User feedback (e.g., dragging furniture, changing styles) refines the persona prediction and updates the layout suggestions in real-time.

6.  **Furniture Selection & Conformance:** Extend existing conformance checking to include persona-specific preferences. For example, a 'gamer' persona might prioritize ergonomic chairs and large monitors, while a 'minimalist' persona would favor smaller, multi-functional furniture.

**Pseudocode (Layout Generation):**

```
function generate_layout(room_data, user_profile):
  persona = predict_persona(room_data, user_profile)
  layout_templates = get_layout_templates(persona)
  
  // Sample from the distribution of layout templates
  selected_template = sample_template(layout_templates)
  
  // Generate initial bounding box arrangement based on template
  bounding_boxes = generate_bounding_boxes(selected_template, room_data)
  
  // Apply persona-specific furniture preferences
  furniture_preferences = get_furniture_preferences(persona)
  
  // Select furniture items for each bounding box based on preferences
  populated_layout = populate_layout(bounding_boxes, furniture_preferences)
  
  return populated_layout
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond reactive layout recommendation to *proactive* prediction. This allows the system to anticipate user needs and provide more relevant and personalized suggestions, even before the user starts interacting with the system.
