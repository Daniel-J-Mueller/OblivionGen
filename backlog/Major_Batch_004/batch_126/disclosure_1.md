## Adaptive Projection Mapping with Biofeedback

**Concept:** Augment the light uniformity testing system with real-time biofeedback data from a user to dynamically adjust the projected image and lighting, creating a personalized and optimized viewing experience. This moves beyond simple uniformity correction to active, user-centric visual optimization.

**System Specs:**

*   **Biofeedback Sensors:** Integrate sensors to monitor physiological signals:
    *   Electroencephalography (EEG): Measure brainwave activity (focus, relaxation).
    *   Pupillometry: Track pupil dilation/constriction (cognitive load, interest).
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR): Measure skin conductivity (emotional arousal).
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV): Measure heart rate fluctuations (stress, cognitive state).
*   **Data Acquisition & Processing Unit:** A dedicated module to:
    *   Receive raw sensor data.
    *   Filter and process the data to extract relevant features (e.g., alpha/theta brainwave ratios, pupil diameter, GSR amplitude, HRV metrics).
    *   Apply machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks, support vector machines) to predict user cognitive and emotional states.
*   **Projection Control Module:** An interface between the data processing unit and the light emitting device. This module receives state predictions from the data processing unit and modulates the projected light accordingly.
*   **Adaptive Algorithms:**  A suite of algorithms to map user states to projection parameters:
    *   **Focus Enhancement:** If EEG indicates low focus, subtly increase contrast and saturation in key image areas.
    *   **Relaxation Mode:** If GSR indicates high stress, shift color temperature towards warmer tones (red/orange) and reduce brightness. Introduce slow, gentle visual transitions.
    *   **Interest Amplification:** If pupillometry shows decreasing interest in a particular visual element, dynamically adjust its brightness, color, or position to recapture attention.
    *   **Cognitive Load Balancing:** Analyze HRV and adjust complexity of the projected image. Simplify visual elements if cognitive load is high, and increase detail if cognitive load is low.
*   **Calibration Routine:** A procedure to personalize the system for each user. 
    *   User views a series of images/videos while biofeedback data is recorded.
    *   Machine learning model is trained to associate specific biofeedback patterns with preferred visual settings.
*   **Software Interface:** A user-friendly interface to monitor biofeedback data, adjust algorithm parameters, and initiate the calibration routine.

**Pseudocode for Adaptive Projection Algorithm:**

```
// Define biofeedback data thresholds
float focusThreshold = 0.5;
float stressThreshold = 0.6;

// Get current biofeedback data
float focusLevel = getFocusLevel();
float stressLevel = getStressLevel();

// Adjust projection parameters based on biofeedback
if (focusLevel < focusThreshold) {
  // Increase contrast and saturation
  contrast = contrast * 1.1;
  saturation = saturation * 1.1;
}

if (stressLevel > stressThreshold) {
  // Reduce brightness and shift color temperature
  brightness = brightness * 0.9;
  colorTemperature = colorTemperature + 200; // Shift towards warmer tones
}

// Apply adjustments to projection
setBrightness(brightness);
setColorTemperature(colorTemperature);
setContrast(contrast);
setSaturation(saturation);
```

**Refinement Potential:**

*   **Multi-User Adaptation:**  Develop algorithms to adapt projections to multiple users simultaneously.
*   **Emotional State Recognition:**  Employ more sophisticated machine learning models to recognize a wider range of emotional states.
*   **Content-Aware Adaptation:**  Integrate image analysis algorithms to adapt projections based on the content being displayed.
*   **Virtual/Augmented Reality Integration:** Extend the system to VR/AR environments.
