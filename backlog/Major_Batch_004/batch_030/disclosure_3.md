## Dynamic Memory Affinity Shaping

**Concept:** Leverage TLB event data to proactively shape memory affinity of processes, minimizing TLB churn and optimizing for predictable access patterns. This moves beyond simply *reacting* to TLB misses and towards *predicting* and *influencing* memory access.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Components:**
    *   Existing MMU with TLB and TLB event logging circuit (as per the provided patent).
    *   A “Memory Affinity Engine” (MAE) – a dedicated hardware unit (potentially integrated into the MMU or a co-processor).
    *   Fast on-chip memory (SRAM) within the MAE – “Affinity Map”.
    *   DMA Engine – for efficient data movement between physical memory and potential tiered memory systems.

*   **Software Components:**
    *   Kernel driver for MAE configuration and monitoring.
    *   Process monitoring agent – tracks process access patterns (at a coarse granularity).
    *   Policy engine – defines rules for affinity shaping based on process type, priority, and access patterns.

*   **Affinity Map Structure:**
    *   The Affinity Map is a multi-dimensional array indexed by:
        *   Process ID (PID)
        *   Virtual Memory Page Number (VPN)
        *   Physical Memory Bank/Node ID
    *   Each entry in the map contains:
        *   “Affinity Score” – a weighted value indicating the desirability of keeping the VPN mapped to the specified Physical Memory Bank.
        *   “Volatility” – a measure of how frequently the VPN is accessed.
        *   “Last Access Time” - timestamp for tracking recency.

*   **Operation:**

    1.  **TLB Event Monitoring:** The TLB event logging circuit captures TLB misses, evictions, and hits, along with associated VPN, PID, and physical address.
    2.  **Affinity Map Updates:** The data from TLB events is fed to the MAE.
        *   *On TLB Miss:* Decrease Affinity Score for the Physical Memory Bank of the VPN.
        *   *On TLB Hit:* Increase Affinity Score for the Physical Memory Bank of the VPN.
        *   *On TLB Eviction:* Significantly decrease Affinity Score, and potentially trigger a migration request.
        *   Volatility and Last Access Time are updated with each event.
    3.  **Migration Requests:** The MAE periodically scans the Affinity Map. If a VPN has a low Affinity Score for its current Physical Memory Bank, and a high Affinity Score for another bank, the MAE generates a migration request.
    4.  **Migration Implementation:** The DMA Engine, under the control of the kernel driver, moves the VPN’s data from the source bank to the destination bank. The MMU’s page tables are updated accordingly.
    5. **Tiered Memory Support**: For systems with tiered memory (e.g. DRAM + Persistent Memory), the affinity map can also track preference for *which tier* a VPN resides on. Frequently accessed pages get promoted to faster tiers.
    6. **Predictive Prefetching**: Using historical access patterns (tracked in the Affinity Map), the MAE can issue prefetch requests to bring VPN data into the cache or faster memory tiers before it is actually needed.

*   **Pseudocode (Kernel Driver – Migration Logic):**

    ```
    function scan_affinity_map() {
        for each pid in process_list {
            for each vpn in pid.vpn_list {
                best_bank = find_best_bank(vpn, pid) // Based on Affinity Map scores
                current_bank = get_current_bank(vpn)

                if (best_bank != current_bank) {
                    request_migration(vpn, current_bank, best_bank)
                }
            }
        }
    }

    function request_migration(vpn, source_bank, dest_bank) {
        // Initiate DMA transfer of VPN data from source_bank to dest_bank
        // Update MMU page tables to map VPN to dest_bank
        // Log migration event for monitoring
    }
    ```

*   **Potential Benefits:**
    *   Reduced TLB churn, leading to improved performance.
    *   More predictable memory access patterns.
    *   Optimized utilization of tiered memory systems.
    *   Enhanced performance for data-intensive applications.
