## Adaptive Acoustic Environment Mapping & Projection

**Core Concept:** Extend the device's awareness beyond simple voice command reception to actively *shape* the acoustic environment for optimal speech recognition *and* user experience. This moves beyond echo cancellation to proactive acoustic tailoring.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate an array of ultrasonic sensors (time-of-flight) into the housing – top, bottom, and sides. Resolution: 5cm granularity within a 3-meter radius.
*   **Acoustic Projection System:** Implement a phased array of micro-speakers embedded *within* the housing walls, capable of directional sound emission (beamforming). Minimum: 16 speakers. Frequency range: 20Hz - 20kHz.
*   **Processing Unit Enhancement:** Dedicated neural network module trained for real-time acoustic mapping and beamforming control. Minimum processing power: 10 TOPS.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Mapper:** Processes ultrasonic sensor data to construct a 3D point cloud representation of the surrounding environment, identifying surfaces, obstacles, and potential reflection points.
    *   **Reflection Predictor:**  Utilizes ray tracing algorithms, informed by the 3D map, to predict sound wave propagation and identify areas of potential acoustic interference.
    *   **Beamforming Controller:** Dynamically adjusts the phase and amplitude of each micro-speaker in the phased array to:
        *   **Nullify Reflections:** Create destructive interference patterns to cancel out unwanted reflections from identified surfaces.
        *   **Focus Reception:** Steer a narrow “beam” of acoustic sensitivity towards the expected user location for improved voice capture.
        *   **Spatial Audio Enhancement:**  Project sounds originating from the device (e.g., alerts, responses) to appear to originate from specific points in space, creating a more immersive experience.

**Operation:**

1.  **Mapping Phase:** Upon device initialization (or user request), the ultrasonic sensors scan the room, building a 3D acoustic map.
2.  **Analysis Phase:** The Reflection Predictor analyzes the map, identifying potential acoustic issues.
3.  **Adaptive Beamforming:** The Beamforming Controller dynamically adjusts the phased array, creating:
    *   “Silent Zones” in areas prone to strong reflections.
    *   A focused “listening cone” towards the user.
4.  **Continuous Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors the environment and adapts the beamforming parameters to account for changes (e.g., people moving, objects being rearranged).
5.  **Spatial Audio Integration:** When playing audio, the system utilizes the 3D map to position sounds within the room, enhancing the sense of realism.

**Pseudocode (Beamforming Controller):**

```
// Input: 3D Acoustic Map, User Location, Desired Audio Source Location
// Output: Phase & Amplitude settings for each micro-speaker

function calculateBeamformingSettings(acousticMap, userLocation, audioSourceLocation) {

  for each speaker in speakerArray {
    // Calculate distance from speaker to user
    distanceToUser = calculateDistance(speaker.location, userLocation)

    // Calculate distance from speaker to audio source
    distanceToSource = calculateDistance(speaker.location, audioSourceLocation)

    // Calculate phase delay based on distance to user & desired frequency
    phaseDelay = (distanceToUser / speedOfSound) * frequency * 360 

    // Calculate amplitude based on distance to user (attenuation)
    amplitude = 1.0 / distanceToUser 

    // Adjust amplitude and phase to nullify reflections (based on acoustic map)
    // This requires complex calculations based on reflection points and angles
    reflectionAdjustment = calculateReflectionAdjustment(speaker.location, acousticMap)
    amplitude = amplitude * reflectionAdjustment.amplitude
    phaseDelay = phaseDelay + reflectionAdjustment.phase

    // Set speaker settings
    speaker.amplitude = amplitude
    speaker.phase = phaseDelay
  }

  return speakerArray
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced voice assistant performance in noisy or reverberant environments.
*   Creation of personalized “acoustic bubbles” for private conversations.
*   Immersive spatial audio experiences.
*   Accessibility features for individuals with hearing impairments.
