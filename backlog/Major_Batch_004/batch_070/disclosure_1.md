## Temporal Identity Anchors & Reputation Propagation

**Concept:** Expand the 'Persistent Source Value' (PSV) beyond simple identity tracking to create a dynamic reputation system anchored to temporal identity states. Instead of *just* tracking who did what under an assumed identity, we track *how well* they did, and propagate that reputation *across* assumed identities, weighted by time and context.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structure: Temporal Reputation Profile (TRP)**

```
TRP = {
    PSV: String, // Persistent Source Value (original identifier)
    IdentityHistory: [
        {
            AssumedIdentity: String, 
            Timestamp: DateTime,
            Context: String, // e.g., "accessing financial data", "code deployment", "customer support"
            PerformanceScore: Float (0.0 - 1.0), //  Score based on automated analysis & human feedback
            TrustWeight: Float (0.0-1.0) // How much this specific instance should influence future calculations. Defaults to 1.0. Decreases with time/inactivity.
        }
    ]
}
```

**2.  Reputation Scoring Engine:**

*   **Automated Analysis:** Integrate with existing monitoring and logging systems. Analyze actions performed under an assumed identity. Metrics include:
    *   Error rates
    *   Resource utilization
    *   Compliance violations
    *   Security alerts
*   **Human Feedback Loop:** Allow for manual review and scoring of actions (e.g., flagged transactions, customer support interactions).
*   **PerformanceScore Calculation:** Combine automated metrics and human feedback to generate a `PerformanceScore` for each `IdentityHistory` entry. A weighted average is recommended, prioritizing recent data.

**3. Trust Weight Decay:**

*   Implement a time-based decay function for `TrustWeight`.  Older `IdentityHistory` entries have less influence on future calculations.
*   `TrustWeight =  InitialWeight * e^(-decayRate * timeSinceLastActivity)`
*   `decayRate` is configurable based on context (e.g., high-security contexts have faster decay).

**4. Identity Assumption & Reputation Propagation:**

1.  Client requests a new assumed identity, providing `PSV` and desired `Context`.
2.  Identity Manager retrieves the associated `TRP` from a datastore.
3.  Calculate a ‘Reputation Score’ for the `PSV` based on the weighted average of `PerformanceScore` values across all `IdentityHistory` entries, weighted by `TrustWeight`.
4.  Dynamically adjust permissions and access levels granted to the assumed identity based on the calculated ‘Reputation Score’. Higher scores grant broader access.
5.  When an action is performed under the assumed identity:
    *   Log the action with the `PSV` and `AssumedIdentity`.
    *   Update the `PerformanceScore` for the current `AssumedIdentity` entry in the `TRP`.
    *   Recalculate the overall ‘Reputation Score’ for the `PSV` and propagate it to future identity assumptions.

**5. Policy Integration:**

*   Integrate with existing PSV policies. Allow policies to specify minimum Reputation Scores required for certain actions or resource access.
*   Implement dynamic policy adjustments based on real-time Reputation Scores.

**6. Datastore Considerations:**

*   Use a scalable datastore capable of handling high volumes of TRP data.
*   Consider using a graph database to represent relationships between PSVs, Assumed Identities, and actions.



This system moves beyond simple auditability to build a dynamically adapting security and trust model.  It allows for granular access control based on demonstrated behavior, promoting accountability and reducing risk.
