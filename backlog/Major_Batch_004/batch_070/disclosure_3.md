## Dynamic Entity Sharding with Predictive Migration

**Concept:** Expand on the entity-based partitioning by introducing a predictive migration system. Instead of *reacting* to partition load, proactively shift entities based on anticipated growth patterns and usage predictions.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Analytics Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical data on entity access patterns (read/write frequency, data size changes), customer behavior trends (seasonal spikes, promotional event impact), and system load metrics.
*   **Processing:** Employ time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict future entity growth and access rates. Calculate a "migration score" for each entity, reflecting its likelihood of becoming a hotspot.
*   **Output:**  A ranked list of entities with migration scores, along with recommended target partitions for migration. Update frequency: hourly.

**2. Automated Migration Engine:**

*   **Trigger:**  Migration score exceeds a predefined threshold. Threshold dynamically adjusted based on overall system capacity and availability.
*   **Process:**
    *   Select entities from the ranked list for migration. Prioritize entities with low inter-entity dependencies to minimize transaction complexity.
    *   Identify a suitable target partition with sufficient capacity. Prioritize partitions with lower current load.
    *   Initiate data replication to the target partition (as described in the source patent).
    *   Update the entity-partition table to reflect the new allocation.
    *   Transparently redirect traffic to the target partition.
    *   Monitor migration performance (latency, error rate).
*   **Concurrency Control:** Implement optimistic locking to prevent conflicts during data migration.

**3. Dynamic Partition Adjustment:**

*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor partition capacity utilization and load distribution.
*   **Scaling:** Automatically add or remove partitions based on predefined scaling policies.
*   **Partition Splitting/Merging:** Implement algorithms for splitting overloaded partitions or merging underutilized ones, minimizing data movement and downtime.

**4.  "Shadow" Replication for Prediction Validation:**

*   **Mechanism:**  Before migrating entities, create "shadow" replicas on potential target partitions.
*   **Traffic Mirroring:**  Mirror a small percentage of read traffic to the shadow replicas.
*   **Performance Comparison:** Compare the performance (latency, throughput) of the shadow replicas with the original partitions.
*   **Decision Making:** Use the performance comparison to validate the migration prediction and refine the migration strategy.

**Pseudocode (Automated Migration Engine):**

```
function migrateEntities() {
  entityList = getEntitiesRankedByMigrationScore();
  for each entity in entityList {
    if (entity.migrationScore > threshold) {
      targetPartition = findOptimalTargetPartition(entity);
      startReplication(entity, targetPartition);
      updateEntityPartitionTable(entity, targetPartition);
      redirectTraffic(entity, targetPartition);
      monitorMigration(entity, targetPartition);
    }
  }
}

function findOptimalTargetPartition(entity) {
  // Criteria: available capacity, current load, network proximity
  // Algorithm: weighted scoring based on criteria
  return bestPartition;
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Entity`: {entityId, migrationScore, size, accessRate, partitionId}
*   `Partition`: {partitionId, capacity, currentLoad, hostList}
*   `Entity-Partition Table`:  Map from entityId to partitionId.
