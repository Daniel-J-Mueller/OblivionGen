## Adaptive Proximity Geofencing with Behavioral Biometrics

**System Overview:**

This system expands on location authentication by integrating behavioral biometrics gathered *from* the devices themselves to dynamically adjust geofence parameters and authentication stringency. It moves beyond static proximity checks to a system that learns user behavior and adapts to deviations, improving both security and user experience.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Data Collector (BDC):** Software residing on each user-associated device (e.g., smartphone, smartwatch). Collects the following data:
    *   **Motion Patterns:** Accelerometer, gyroscope data to identify typical walking/running/driving speeds, turning radii, and gait.
    *   **App Usage:** Frequency and sequence of app launches, time spent in each app.
    *   **Keystroke Dynamics:** Typing speed, rhythm, and pressure (where applicable).
    *   **Touch/Swipe Patterns:**  Analysis of touch input on screen (pressure, speed, area).

2.  **Behavioral Profile Manager (BPM):**  A central server component that:
    *   Aggregates data from all BDCs associated with a user.
    *   Builds a “normal” behavioral profile for each user, utilizing machine learning algorithms (e.g., anomaly detection, Hidden Markov Models).
    *   Continuously updates the profile based on new data.
    *   Calculates a “Behavioral Deviation Score” (BDS) representing how much current behavior differs from the established profile.

3.  **Dynamic Geofence Engine (DGE):**  Controls the geofence parameters based on BDS and other contextual factors.
    *   **Adaptive Radius:**  Geofence radius is *not* fixed. It expands or contracts based on BDS.
        *   High BDS (significant deviation): Geofence radius *increases*, allowing for more leeway.  Assumes user may be in an unusual situation (e.g., taking a taxi instead of walking).
        *   Low BDS: Geofence radius *decreases*, requiring more precise location matching.
    *   **Shape Adjustment:** Geofence shape can adapt. For example, if motion data indicates the user is traveling on a straight path (e.g., driving on a highway), the geofence shape can become elongated along that path.
    *   **Multi-Geofence Support:**  Allows for overlapping or nested geofences to model complex user routines (e.g., home, work, gym).

4.  **Authentication Orchestrator:**  Combines location data, BDS, and potentially other authentication factors (e.g., password, biometric scan) to determine access.

**Pseudocode - Authentication Orchestrator:**

```
function authenticateUser(user, firstDeviceLocation, secondDeviceData) {

  // 1. Get User Profile
  userProfile = getUserProfile(user);

  // 2. Calculate Behavioral Deviation Score (BDS)
  bds = calculateBDS(secondDeviceData, userProfile);

  // 3. Determine Adaptive Geofence Radius
  geofenceRadius = baseRadius * (1 + bds); // Scale radius by BDS

  // 4. Check Location Proximity
  locationValid = isWithinGeofence(firstDeviceLocation, secondDeviceLocation, geofenceRadius);

  // 5. Authentication Decision
  if (locationValid) {
    // Location is valid, grant access
    return ACCESS_GRANTED;
  } else {
    // Location is invalid, request additional authentication
    if (additionalAuthenticationSuccessful()) {
      return ACCESS_GRANTED;
    } else {
      return ACCESS_DENIED;
    }
  }
}
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  User attempts to access a service.
2.  Service requests location authentication.
3.  BDC on user's devices collects behavioral and location data.
4.  Data is sent to BPM.
5.  BPM calculates BDS and updates user profile.
6.  Authentication Orchestrator determines geofence parameters and performs proximity check.
7.  Access is granted or denied based on the result.

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple location-based authentication by incorporating a dynamic behavioral component.  The adaptive geofence radius and shape adjustment enhance both security (by being more resilient to unusual activity) and user experience (by reducing false positives). By learning user behavior, the system can differentiate between legitimate deviations (e.g., taking a different route) and potentially malicious activity.
