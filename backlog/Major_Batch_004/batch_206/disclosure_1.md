**Dynamic Behavioral Sandboxing with Adaptive Granularity**

**Concept:** Extend the frequency-based anomaly detection to create a dynamically adjusting sandbox environment. Instead of just blocking or preventing access, the system will *shift* code execution into increasingly isolated environments based on behavioral drift.

**Specification:**

1.  **Behavioral Profile Construction:** During the learning period, establish a baseline behavioral profile for each invoked portion (class, method) of the software package. This profile includes:
    *   Frequency of invocation.
    *   Input parameter ranges (min/max values, data types).
    *   Return value ranges.
    *   External resource access (files, network, other processes).
    *   Execution time.
2.  **Deviation Scoring:** After the learning period, a deviation score is calculated for each invoked portion based on real-time monitoring of the above parameters. The score represents how much the current behavior deviates from the established baseline.
3.  **Sandboxing Levels:** Define multiple sandboxing levels, ranging from 'No Isolation' (normal execution) to 'Full Isolation' (completely virtualized environment).  Each level imposes increasing restrictions:
    *   Level 0: No Isolation – Normal execution.
    *   Level 1: Limited Resource Access – Restrict file system access, network access, and inter-process communication.
    *   Level 2: Memory Isolation – Execute within a separate memory space with limited access to the main application's memory.
    *   Level 3: Emulation – Execute within an emulated environment, allowing complete control over execution flow and resource access.
4.  **Dynamic Sandboxing Adjustment:**
    *   If a deviation score exceeds a predefined threshold, the invoked portion is moved to the next higher sandboxing level.
    *   If the deviation score returns to within acceptable limits, the invoked portion is moved to a lower sandboxing level.
    *   Sandboxing level adjustments are performed in real-time, with minimal impact on application performance.
5.  **Granularity Control:** The system dynamically adjusts the granularity of sandboxing based on the severity of the deviation.
    *   Minor deviations may only trigger sandboxing at the method level.
    *   Severe deviations may trigger sandboxing at the class level or even the entire process level.
6.  **Adaptive Thresholds:** Utilize machine learning to dynamically adjust the deviation thresholds based on the overall system health and security posture. This prevents false positives and ensures that the system remains responsive to emerging threats.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Learning Phase
FOR EACH invoked_portion IN software_package:
    collect_behavioral_data(invoked_portion)
    build_baseline_profile(invoked_portion)

// Monitoring Phase
FOR EACH invoked_portion IN software_package:
    monitor_behavior(invoked_portion)
    deviation_score = calculate_deviation_score(invoked_portion)
    current_sandboxing_level = get_current_sandboxing_level(invoked_portion)

    IF deviation_score > threshold:
        new_sandboxing_level = min(current_sandboxing_level + 1, MAX_SANDBOXING_LEVEL)
        apply_sandboxing_level(invoked_portion, new_sandboxing_level)
    ELSE IF deviation_score < lower_threshold:
        new_sandboxing_level = max(current_sandboxing_level - 1, 0)
        apply_sandboxing_level(invoked_portion, new_sandboxing_level)

    log_sandboxing_events(invoked_portion, current_sandboxing_level, new_sandboxing_level)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**  Requires a processor with virtualization extensions (e.g., Intel VT-x or AMD-V) for efficient sandboxing. Ample RAM is necessary to accommodate multiple sandboxed environments.

**Potential Applications:**  Advanced malware detection, intrusion prevention, vulnerability analysis, and secure execution of untrusted code.
