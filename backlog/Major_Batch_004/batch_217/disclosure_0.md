## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Extension

**Concept:** Expand the perceived acoustic scene beyond the immediate environment captured by the earbuds’ microphones. This creates a more immersive and contextually aware audio experience, particularly useful for augmented reality (AR) or enhanced spatial audio applications.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing wireless earbud with 3+ microphones (as per the provided patent).
    *   Bone conduction transducer integrated into the earbud frame.
    *   Low-power, short-range Bluetooth beacon module.
    *   Miniature inertial measurement unit (IMU) - accelerometer & gyroscope.
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Microphone Array Processing:** Utilize the existing microphone array for accurate sound source localization (direction and distance).
    *   **Bone Conduction Input:** Capture subtle vibrations transmitted through the user’s skull (e.g., footsteps, approaching vehicles, nearby conversations) using the bone conduction transducer.
    *   **Beacon Integration:**  Implement a network of Bluetooth beacons placed in static locations (e.g., a room, a street corner). The earbud detects beacon proximity & ID.
    *   **IMU Data Fusion:** Combine IMU data (head movement, acceleration) with microphone array and beacon data.
    *   **Acoustic Scene Mapping:** Construct a dynamic, probabilistic map of the acoustic environment. This map stores information about:
        *   Identified sound sources (type, location, intensity).
        *   Reflections and reverberation characteristics.
        *   Beacon-associated acoustic profiles (e.g., “coffee shop,” “office,” “park”).
    *   **Acoustic Scene Extension Algorithm:**
        1.  **Baseline:** Utilize the microphone array for real-time sound capture.
        2.  **Bone Conduction Augmentation:** Process bone conduction data to identify low-frequency vibrations and subtle sounds not captured by the microphones.
        3.  **Beacon Contextualization:**  Query the beacon network to obtain an acoustic profile for the current location.
        4.  **IMU-Based Prediction:**  Predict changes in the acoustic environment based on head movement (e.g., turning towards a sound source).
        5.  **Fusion & Synthesis:** Combine all data sources to synthesize an extended acoustic scene.
        6.  **Spatial Audio Rendering:** Render the extended acoustic scene using spatial audio techniques (e.g., HRTF filtering) to create a more immersive experience.

**Pseudocode (Core Algorithm):**

```
//Initialization:
load_beacon_map() //loads the static beacon profiles
initialize_acoustic_scene_map()

//Realtime Loop:
audio_input = capture_microphone_array_data()
bone_conduction_input = capture_bone_conduction_data()
beacon_data = detect_beacon_proximity()

//Process Data
predicted_scene = predict_acoustic_scene(audio_input, bone_conduction_input, beacon_data)

//Acoustic Scene Synthesis
extended_scene = synthesize_acoustic_scene(predicted_scene)

//Spatial Audio Rendering
render_spatial_audio(extended_scene)

//Output Audio
output_audio_to_earbuds()
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **AR/VR:** Enhance the realism of AR/VR experiences by incorporating realistic ambient sounds.
*   **Navigation:** Provide contextual audio cues during navigation (e.g., “turn left at the coffee shop”).
*   **Accessibility:** Assist individuals with hearing impairments by augmenting ambient sounds.
*   **Situational Awareness:** Improve situational awareness in noisy or crowded environments.
