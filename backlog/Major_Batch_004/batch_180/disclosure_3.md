## Adaptive Bio-Luminescence Doorbell

**Concept:** A doorbell system integrating bioluminescent bacterial cultures within a transparent housing, creating a naturally glowing doorbell that adapts its intensity and color based on ambient light and user preference.

**Specifications:**

*   **Housing:** Cast acrylic or polycarbonate shell, approximately 15cm x 10cm x 5cm.  Internal chamber sealed with a breathable, optically clear membrane. Rounded edges and smooth surfaces for ease of cleaning.
*   **Bacterial Culture:** Genetically engineered *Vibrio fischeri* (or similar bioluminescent bacteria) optimized for consistent, reliable light emission at room temperature. Culture encapsulated in a transparent, nutrient-rich hydrogel.
*   **Light Sensor:** Ambient light sensor (photodiode) integrated into the housing. Range: 0.1 lux to 100,000 lux.
*   **Microcontroller:** ESP32 or similar, with Wi-Fi connectivity.
*   **Nutrient Delivery System:** Microfluidic channels within the hydrogel matrix delivering a slow-release nutrient solution to sustain bacterial growth. Reservoir for nutrient solution accessible for refills.
*   **Color Control (Optional):**  Genetic engineering to allow for controlled expression of different fluorescent proteins (e.g., GFP, RFP, YFP) within the bacterial culture, selectable via app control.  Alternatively, use of multiple bacterial strains each emitting a different color.
*   **Brightness Control:** PWM signal to control the flow rate of nutrients, influencing bacterial metabolic rate and light emission.  Also controlled via app.
*   **Power:** USB-C powered, with optional battery backup.
*   **Doorbell Button:** Capacitive touch sensor integrated into the housing.
*   **Notification System:** Wi-Fi connected; sends push notifications to user’s smartphone upon button press.

**Pseudocode (Control Logic):**

```
// Initialization
initialize light sensor
initialize Wi-Fi connection
initialize nutrient pump

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    ambientLight = readLightSensor()
    
    //Adaptive Brightness
    if (ambientLight < 10 lux) {
        setBrightness(100%) // Max brightness in darkness
    } else if (ambientLight < 100 lux) {
        setBrightness(75%)
    } else if (ambientLight < 500 lux) {
        setBrightness(50%)
    } else {
        setBrightness(25%) // Minimum brightness in daylight
    }
    
    // Button Press Event
    if (buttonPressed()) {
        sendNotification("Doorbell Ringing")
        //Optional: Pulse brightness briefly on button press
    }
    
    delay(100ms)
}

// Function: setBrightness(percentage)
// Adjust nutrient pump flow rate to control bacterial metabolic rate.
// Percentage maps to pump flow rate (calibration required).

// Function: sendNotification(message)
// Sends push notification via Wi-Fi.
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   Self-sterilization cycle with UV light to maintain culture health.
*   Integration with smart home ecosystems (e.g., Alexa, Google Home).
*   Customizable hydrogel shape and color.
*   Potential for artistic expression – control bacteria to form patterns or display messages.
*   Nutrient source could be sustainably derived.
