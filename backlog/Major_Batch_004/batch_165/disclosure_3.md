## Personalized Cross-Channel ‘Mood’ Targeting

**Concept:** Extend demographic probability vectors to include ‘mood’ or emotional state, inferred from content consumption across all channels (OTT, traditional TV, web browsing, social media - if accessible).  This allows ad targeting not just *who* is watching, but *how* they are feeling, significantly increasing ad relevance and potential impact.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    *   **OTT Data:** Continue receiving OTT impression data as per the original patent.
    *   **TV Data:** Continue receiving TV viewing data.
    *   **Web/Social Data (Optional):**  If user consent is granted, integrate web browsing history and social media activity.  This requires robust privacy safeguards.

2.  **Mood Inference Engine:**
    *   **Content Analysis:**  Analyze the *content* being consumed. Utilize NLP and computer vision to extract emotional cues from text, imagery, and audio.  
        *   Example: A program featuring dramatic, suspenseful music and quick cuts might be flagged as "high arousal, negative valence." A cooking show featuring bright colors and upbeat music might be flagged as "low arousal, positive valence."
    *   **Time of Day/Day of Week:** Consider temporal factors.  Viewing habits and emotional states vary based on time of day and day of the week.
    *   **User History:** Track individual user's historical content consumption and associated inferred moods.

3.  **Mood Vector Generation:**
    *   Create a ‘Mood Probability Vector’ alongside the demographic probability vector.
    *   Entries in the Mood Vector represent the probability that a viewer is experiencing a specific mood state (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry, Relaxed, Focused, Bored).
    *   Mood Vector entries should be normalized to sum to 1.

4.  **Combined Probability Vector:**
    *   Combine the Demographic Probability Vector and the Mood Probability Vector into a single, comprehensive vector.
    *   Weighting factors can be applied to prioritize either demographic or mood data, based on ad campaign goals.

5.  **Ad Targeting Algorithm:**
    *   Develop an algorithm that matches ads to viewers based on their combined probability vector.
    *   Ads should be categorized by the emotional states they are likely to resonate with (e.g., a feel-good ad for a relaxing product, an empowering ad for a fitness product).
    *   A/B testing will be crucial to optimize ad-mood matching.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Ad Selection):**

```
// Input: User's Combined Probability Vector (Demographic + Mood)
// Input: Ad Database (Ads categorized by emotional resonance)

function select_ad(user_vector, ad_database) {
  best_ad = null
  highest_score = -1

  for each ad in ad_database {
    ad_vector = ad.emotional_profile // A vector representing the ad's emotional resonance
    score = dot_product(user_vector, ad_vector)  // Calculate the similarity between the user and the ad

    if score > highest_score {
      highest_score = score
      best_ad = ad
    }
  }

  return best_ad
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance servers for data processing and model training.
*   Machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries.
*   Computer Vision libraries.
*   Secure data storage and privacy protocols.
