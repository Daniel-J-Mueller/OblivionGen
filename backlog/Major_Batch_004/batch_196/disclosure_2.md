## Dynamic Root Cause Attribution via Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion

**Specification:** Develop a system capable of dynamically attributing root causes not solely based on text data (customer comments, return codes) but integrated with sensor data collected *during* product use. This moves beyond post-return analysis to potential *pre*-failure prediction and proactive intervention.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Sensor Suite Integration:** The system will ingest data from a variety of embedded sensors within the returned product. These could include:
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope: Capture usage patterns, impacts, and stress.
    *   Temperature Sensors: Identify overheating or thermal stress.
    *   Microphone: Detect unusual sounds indicative of mechanical failure.
    *   Strain Gauges: Measure physical stress/deformation.
    *   Current/Voltage Sensors: Monitor electrical load and anomalies.
2.  **Time-Series Data Preprocessing:** Raw sensor data will undergo cleaning, filtering, and feature extraction. Techniques include:
    *   Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): Identify dominant frequencies indicative of vibration or resonance.
    *   Wavelet Transforms: Capture transient events and multi-scale features.
    *   Statistical Feature Extraction: Mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis of sensor signals.
3.  **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Combine time-series data with textual data (return codes, comments) using a hierarchical Bayesian network:
    *   **Level 1: Sensor Data Bayesian Network:** Infer hidden states representing product operating conditions (e.g., ‘high stress’, ‘overheating’, ‘unusual vibration’). This network will utilize the time-series data as input.
    *   **Level 2: Text Data Bayesian Network:** (As defined in the provided patent). Infer root cause probabilities based on customer feedback.
    *   **Level 3: Fusion Network:** A higher-level Bayesian network that integrates the outputs of the Level 1 and Level 2 networks. This network will learn the relationships between operating conditions and root causes.
4.  **Anomaly Detection & Predictive Maintenance:** The system will employ anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forests) on the sensor data to identify deviations from normal operating conditions. This will enable predictive maintenance by proactively alerting users to potential failures.
5.  **Dynamic Weighting:** Adjust the weights assigned to sensor data versus textual data based on data quality and reliability. For example, if a sensor is known to be unreliable, its weight will be decreased.

**Pseudocode (Fusion Network):**

```
// Define variables
sensor_states: array of inferred states from Level 1
text_probabilities: array of root cause probabilities from Level 2
fusion_network: Bayesian Network (defined with priors)

// Inference loop
for each returned product:

    // Get sensor states and text probabilities
    sensor_states = get_sensor_states(product)
    text_probabilities = get_text_probabilities(product)

    // Update prior probabilities in fusion network based on sensor and text data
    fusion_network.update_prior(sensor_states, text_probabilities)

    // Perform Bayesian inference to estimate root cause distribution
    root_cause_distribution = fusion_network.infer_posterior()

    // Output root cause distribution with uncertainty
    output root_cause_distribution

```
