## Personalized Recommendation ‘Constellations’

**Concept:** Expand beyond individual purchase phrase recommendations to create interconnected ‘constellations’ of recommended items based on complex user profiles built from purchase history *and* browsing behavior. This moves beyond simple phrase matching towards a more holistic understanding of user needs.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Profile Construction:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate purchase history, browsing history (product views, time spent on pages, search queries), demographic data (if available & consented to), and explicit user ratings/reviews.
*   **Feature Extraction:**  Develop a feature extraction module to translate raw data into quantifiable features.  Examples:
    *   *Keyword Frequency:* Counts of keywords extracted from purchase phrases, browsing history, and product descriptions.
    *   *Category Affinity:*  Strength of association between a user and various product categories.
    *   *Price Sensitivity:* User’s typical spending range for different categories.
    *   *Temporal Trends:*  Seasonal purchasing patterns, frequency of purchases within categories.
*   **User Profile Representation:** Represent each user as a high-dimensional vector capturing their feature values.  Employ techniques like TF-IDF weighting, word embeddings, or more advanced neural network embeddings.

**2. Constellation Generation:**

*   **Similarity Metric:**  Define a similarity metric to measure the relatedness of items.  Beyond simple collaborative filtering, incorporate content-based similarity (based on product descriptions, attributes, tags) and knowledge graph embeddings (if a knowledge graph of products exists).
*   **Constellation Algorithm:**
    1.  **Seed Item Selection:**  Identify ‘seed’ items based on recent purchases or browsing history.
    2.  **Expansion:**  Expand the constellation by iteratively adding items that:
        *   Are highly similar to existing items in the constellation.
        *   Are frequently co-purchased or co-browsed with existing items.
        *   Are predicted to be relevant based on the user’s profile.
    3.  **Diversity Control:** Introduce a diversity penalty to prevent the constellation from becoming overly homogenous. This could involve penalizing items that are too similar to each other.
    4.  **Constellation Size Limit:** Set a maximum size for the constellation to prevent it from becoming overwhelming.
*   **Graph Database:** Utilize a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to store and efficiently query the relationships between items and users.

**3. Recommendation Presentation:**

*   **Constellation Visualization:**  Present the recommendations as a visual ‘constellation’ where items are nodes and relationships are edges.  Users can explore the constellation, zoom in on specific items, and view detailed product information.
*   **Explanatory Recommendations:**  Provide explanations for why each item is being recommended.  For example, “Based on your purchase of ‘golf balls’, we recommend ‘golf tees’ because they are frequently purchased together” or “Because you browsed ‘rose bushes’, we think you might be interested in ‘gardening gloves’.”
*   **Interactive Refinement:** Allow users to refine the constellation by:
    *   Removing items they are not interested in.
    *   Adding items they want to explore further.
    *   Adjusting the diversity and size parameters.

**Pseudocode (Constellation Generation):**

```
function generate_constellation(user_profile, seed_items, max_size):
  constellation = seed_items
  while constellation.size() < max_size:
    candidate_items = []
    for item in constellation:
      candidate_items.extend(find_similar_items(item, user_profile))
      candidate_items.extend(find_co_purchased_items(item))
    
    candidate_items = filter_out_existing_items(candidate_items, constellation)
    
    candidate_items.sort(by=similarity_score(user_profile))
    
    if candidate_items is empty:
      break
    
    best_candidate = candidate_items[0]
    
    constellation.add(best_candidate)
  
  return constellation
```
