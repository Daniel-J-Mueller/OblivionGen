## Adaptive Propeller Surface – Bio-Mimicry & Flow Control

**Concept:**  Mimic the tubercles found on humpback whale flippers to dramatically improve propeller efficiency and reduce noise across a wider range of speeds and altitudes, dynamically adjusting the tubercle geometry based on flight conditions.  The original patent focuses on disrupting airflow *at the tip*, we're aiming to fundamentally alter the entire flow profile *across the blade surface*.

**Specs:**

*   **Propeller Material:** Carbon fiber reinforced polymer matrix with embedded micro-actuators.  High strength-to-weight ratio is crucial.
*   **Blade Profile:**  Base airfoil shape is a standard high-efficiency propeller design (e.g., NACA 65-series). This is modified with a series of small, semi-spherical 'tubercles' distributed across the blade's leading edge and extending approximately 10-15% of the chord length.  Tubercle diameter is 2-5% of the chord length.  Spacing is variable, tighter near the root and widening towards the tip.
*   **Actuation System:** Each tubercle is individually controlled by a miniature piezoelectric actuator embedded within the propeller blade. These actuators allow for precise adjustment of tubercle height (0-2mm) and angle.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   **Pressure Sensors:**  Distributed along the blade surface to measure local pressure distribution.
    *   **Flow Sensors:**  Miniature hot-wire anemometers embedded within the tubercles to directly measure airflow velocity and turbulence.
    *   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):**  To detect propeller speed, angle of attack, and vibration.
    *   **Altitude Sensor:**  For integration with altitude-based control profiles.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated microcontroller manages the sensor data and actuator control.  The control algorithm will feature:
    *   **Lookup Table:** Pre-programmed tubercle configurations optimized for various flight speeds, altitudes, and angles of attack.
    *   **Real-time Adjustment:**  Feedback control loop using the sensor data to dynamically adjust tubercle configurations for optimal performance.
    *   **Machine Learning Integration:**  Capacity to learn and adapt tubercle configurations based on flight data, improving performance over time.
*   **Power Supply:**  Power is supplied via slip rings to the propeller hub, distributing power to the actuators and sensors.

**Pseudocode (Control Loop):**

```
// Initialization
sensor_data = initialize_sensors()
lookup_table = load_predefined_configurations()

// Main Loop
while (flight_active) {
  sensor_data = read_sensors()
  flight_state = determine_flight_state(sensor_data)  // Speed, altitude, AoA

  // Determine initial configuration from lookup table
  config = lookup_table[flight_state]

  // Apply real-time adjustments based on sensor feedback
  error = calculate_error(sensor_data, config) // Compare actual flow to desired flow
  adjustment = calculate_adjustment(error)  // Adjust tubercle height/angle

  apply_adjustment(adjustment)

  // Optional: Machine learning update
  update_model(sensor_data, adjustment)
}
```

**Novelty:** This isn't simply about reducing tip vortices. It’s a dynamic, adaptive system that modifies the entire blade surface to control airflow and improve efficiency across a wider range of conditions. The integration of machine learning allows for continuous optimization and adaptation, something the original patent does not address.  Instead of disrupting flow *after* the fact, we are actively *shaping* it.
