**Holographic Light Field Steering with Metamaterial Arrays**

**Concept:** Expand directional control beyond simple left/right image separation to create a true holographic light field display. Instead of directing light to distinct sides, precisely steer individual light rays to create a 3D image *in space* visible from multiple angles without requiring head tracking or special glasses.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Display Panel:**  A high-resolution micro-LED array (target: 10,000 PPI) serving as the light source. Each micro-LED is individually addressable.
2.  **Metamaterial Layer:** A layer of dynamically reconfigurable metamaterials placed *above* the micro-LED array. These metamaterials will consist of electrically tunable liquid crystals or micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) gratings. The metamaterial array resolution must match or exceed the micro-LED resolution.
3.  **Control System:** A real-time rendering engine connected to a high-speed FPGA. The rendering engine calculates the precise phase and amplitude modulation required for each metamaterial element to steer the light rays. The FPGA controls the voltage applied to each metamaterial element.
4.  **Light Steering Algorithm:**
    *   **Ray Tracing:** A ray tracing algorithm will calculate the path of light rays from each micro-LED.
    *   **Holographic Reconstruction:** The algorithm calculates the interference pattern required to reconstruct the 3D image at the desired location in space.
    *   **Metamaterial Phase Mapping:** The algorithm maps the calculated interference pattern to the phase modulation of the metamaterial elements.  Each element will impart a unique phase shift to the light passing through it.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system dynamically adjusts the phase and amplitude of the metamaterial elements to compensate for viewing angle changes and create a parallax effect.
5.  **Power Management:** A dedicated power delivery network to supply the micro-LED array and metamaterial layer with sufficient power. Precise current control is essential for maintaining image quality and longevity.
6. **Calibration System**: An automated calibration system using infrared cameras and machine learning to map the relationship between applied voltage and phase shift of each metamaterial element, correcting for manufacturing variations and drift.
7.  **Software Interface:**  A software development kit (SDK) to allow developers to create 3D content for the display. The SDK will include tools for importing 3D models, defining light field parameters, and optimizing content for the display.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```pseudocode
// For each pixel in the display:
    // Calculate light ray direction from pixel
    rayDirection = calculateRayDirection(pixelX, pixelY)

    // Calculate phase shift required to steer ray to desired 3D point
    phaseShift = calculatePhaseShift(rayDirection, target3DPoint)

    // Apply voltage to metamaterial element corresponding to phase shift
    setMetamaterialVoltage(metamaterialElement, phaseShift)

    // Update display
    updateDisplay()
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple directional projection to create a true volumetric display by precisely steering individual light rays. The dynamic metamaterial layer allows for real-time adjustment of the light field, creating a 3D image that can be viewed from multiple angles without special glasses. The real-time calibration system is critical for maintaining image quality and correcting for imperfections.
