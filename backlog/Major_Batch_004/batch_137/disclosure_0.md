## Dynamic Task Bundling & Skill-Based Pricing

**Concept:** Extend the automated price determination beyond individual task pacing to encompass dynamic task bundling *and* skill-based pricing tiers. Instead of just adjusting price based on performance *speed*, the system actively constructs task bundles tailored to a worker’s demonstrated skill set, and prices those bundles accordingly.

**Specifications:**

**1. Skill Profile Database:**

*   **Data Points:** Maintain a continuously updating skill profile for each worker. Include:
    *   Task Completion Rate (overall & per task type)
    *   Quality Metrics (derived from requester feedback/validation – accuracy, thoroughness, etc.)
    *   Time to Completion (per task type)
    *   Self-Reported Skills (validated via optional skill assessments)
    *   Worker-Specified Price Preferences (optional – minimum acceptable price per task type/bundle).
*   **Storage:**  Relational database (PostgreSQL preferred) with indexing optimized for rapid skill matching.
*   **API:**  Provide a secure API for accessing & updating skill profiles.

**2. Bundle Generation Engine:**

*   **Input:**  List of available tasks (with associated metadata - task type, required skills, estimated completion time, requester-specified price range).
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   For each worker, identify tasks where their skill profile *exceeds* a threshold for predicted performance (high completion rate, quality, speed).
    *   Construct bundles consisting of these “high-fit” tasks.
    *   Bundle size dynamically adjusted based on worker availability & desired completion timeframe. (e.g., "quick bundles" - 3-5 tasks, "extended bundles" - 10-20 tasks)
    *   Constraint:  Minimize inclusion of tasks where the worker’s skill profile is below a specified threshold (to maintain quality).
*   **Output:**  A list of dynamically generated task bundles, tailored to each worker.

**3. Tiered Pricing Model:**

*   **Pricing Tiers:** Define pricing tiers based on worker skill level (derived from skill profile data).
    *   **Bronze:**  Basic skill level – lower price point.
    *   **Silver:**  Intermediate skill level – moderate price point.
    *   **Gold:**  Advanced skill level – premium price point.
*   **Bundle Pricing:**
    *   Calculate a base price for the bundle (sum of individual task prices).
    *   Apply a multiplier based on the worker's skill tier (e.g., Bronze: x0.9, Silver: x1.0, Gold: x1.1).
    *   Dynamically adjust the final price based on bundle size and estimated completion time. (Smaller, faster bundles = higher price per task).
*   **Price Negotiation (Optional):**  Allow workers to suggest a price for a bundle (within a predefined range).

**4. System Workflow:**

1.  **Task Submission:** Requesters submit tasks with associated metadata.
2.  **Skill Matching:** The system identifies workers whose skill profiles match the task requirements.
3.  **Bundle Generation:** The Bundle Generation Engine constructs tailored task bundles for each worker.
4.  **Price Calculation:**  The Tiered Pricing Model calculates the price for each bundle.
5.  **Bundle Presentation:** The system presents the bundles to the workers.
6.  **Worker Acceptance/Rejection:** Workers accept or reject the bundle.
7.  **Task Execution & Validation:** Workers perform the tasks. Requesters validate the results.
8.  **Skill Profile Update:** The system updates worker skill profiles based on performance data.

**Pseudocode (Bundle Generation):**

```
function generateBundle(workerID, availableTasks):
  workerSkills = getWorkerSkills(workerID)
  eligibleTasks = []
  for task in availableTasks:
    if workerSkills.matches(task.requiredSkills) and workerSkills.predictedPerformance(task) > threshold:
      eligibleTasks.append(task)

  bundle = []
  totalEstimatedTime = 0
  while eligibleTasks is not empty and totalEstimatedTime < maxBundleTime:
    task = selectBestTask(eligibleTasks, workerSkills) # Criteria: predicted performance, estimated time
    bundle.append(task)
    totalEstimatedTime += task.estimatedTime
    eligibleTasks.remove(task)

  return bundle
```
