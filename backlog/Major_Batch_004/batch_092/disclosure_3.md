## Dynamic Device Trust Score & Adaptive Authentication

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple device fingerprint matching to create a continuously updated "Device Trust Score" (DTS). This score isn’t static; it dynamically adjusts based on observed user behavior *and* environmental factors. Authentication isn’t a single event but a rolling evaluation.

**Specs:**

1.  **DTS Calculation:**
    *   Base Score: Established during initial device registration (similar to patent's fingerprinting – browser, OS, etc.).
    *   Behavioral Analysis: Monitor user interaction – typing speed, mouse movements, app usage patterns, time of day access, location consistency. Deviations from established baseline *decrease* the DTS.
    *   Environmental Factors: Integrate external data – IP reputation (threat lists), network anomalies (VPN detection), geofencing (consistent location expectation).
    *   Score Decay: DTS gradually decreases over time if not periodically ‘validated’ by successful authentication/usage.
    *   Weighting:  Adjustable weights for each factor allow for customization based on risk tolerance.  Example: High-value transactions prioritize behavioral analysis; general access leans more on device fingerprint.

2.  **Adaptive Authentication Workflow:**
    *   Low DTS (High Risk): Trigger Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) – SMS, authenticator app, biometric scan.
    *   Medium DTS:  "Step-Up" Authentication – challenge question, one-time code sent to registered email, or push notification to trusted device.
    *   High DTS: Transparent authentication – user access granted without additional prompts.
    *   Risk-Based Challenges: Adaptive challenges, altering the complexity based on perceived risk.

3.  **Anomaly Detection & Remediation:**
    *   Real-time monitoring for significant DTS drops or anomalous behavior.
    *   Automated actions – account lock, session termination, security alerts.
    *   User notification – inform user of suspicious activity and prompt for verification.

4.  **Data Storage & Privacy:**
    *   Secure storage of device fingerprint, behavioral data, and DTS.
    *   Data anonymization and aggregation for improved analysis.
    *   User control over data collection and privacy settings.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Device Registration
function registerDevice(deviceId, fingerprint) {
  store(deviceId, fingerprint)
  DTS = baseScore // Initialize Trust Score
  store(deviceId, DTS)
}

// Authentication Request
function authenticate(deviceId, requestData) {
  DTS = retrieve(deviceId, DTS)
  fingerprint = retrieve(deviceId, fingerprint)

  //Compare fingerprint data - return delta value

  // Analyze requestData (behavioral)
  behavioralDelta = analyzeBehavior(requestData)
  // Assess environmental factors
  environmentalDelta = assessEnvironment(requestData.ipAddress, requestData.location)

  DTS = DTS - behavioralDelta - environmentalDelta

  if (DTS < thresholdHigh) {
    triggerMFA(deviceId)
    return denied
  } else if (DTS < thresholdMedium) {
    triggerStepUpAuth(deviceId)
  }
  return granted
}

//Function to analyze behaviour
function analyzeBehavior(requestData) {
  //code
  return delta
}

//Function to assess environment
function assessEnvironment(ipAddress, location) {
  //code
  return delta
}
```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **Federated Learning:**  Train behavioral models across multiple devices without sharing raw data.
*   **Decentralized Trust Score:**  Utilize blockchain technology for a transparent and tamper-proof DTS.
*   **Predictive Authentication:**  Anticipate potential security breaches based on historical data and predictive analytics.
