## Dynamic Environmental Mapping for Predictive Device State

**Concept:** Augment user presence detection with real-time environmental mapping to *predict* likely user interaction, preemptively adjusting device state for a smoother experience. This moves beyond reactive state changes triggered *by* presence to proactive adjustments *based on* anticipated presence & behavior.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:**
    *   Existing: Utilize existing first & second sensors from the provided patent (proximity, motion, etc.).
    *   Added: Low-resolution (energy efficient) 3D scanning sensor (ToF or structured light). Range: 0.5 - 3 meters. Update rate: 2-5 Hz.
    *   Added: Ambient sound analysis microphone array (directional).
*   **Data Processing:**
    *   **Environmental Map Creation:** The 3D scanner builds a dynamic map of the immediate surroundings (room geometry, furniture, etc.). This map isn't for visual rendering, but for spatial data.
    *   **Behavioral Pattern Learning:** Device learns common user pathways and interaction points within the mapped environment.  (e.g., User consistently walks to the kitchen counter after entering the living room). This is done via a recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN ingests:
        *   Sensor data (from all sensors).
        *   Time of day.
        *   Day of week.
        *   Historical interaction data.
    *   **Predictive Modeling:** Based on the environmental map, learned behavioral patterns, and current sensor data, the system predicts likely user actions and movement. For example, if the user is approaching the kitchen counter, the system anticipates they might interact with appliances.
    *   **Preemptive State Adjustment:**  Based on predictions, the device adjusts its state *before* the user physically interacts.
        *   Power on/off displays relevant to the anticipated action.
        *   Load applications commonly used in that context.
        *   Adjust audio settings (e.g., volume, equalizer).
*   **Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```pseudocode
// Main Loop
while (device is on) {
    // 1. Capture Sensor Data
    sensorData = readAllSensors()

    // 2. Update Environmental Map
    environmentalMap = updateMap(sensorData)

    // 3. Predict User Action
    predictedAction = predictAction(sensorData, environmentalMap, historicalData)

    // 4. Adjust Device State
    if (predictedAction == "approaching kitchen counter") {
        turnOnKitchenDisplay()
        loadRecipeApp()
        setVolumeToMedium()
    } else if (predictedAction == "sitting on couch") {
        turnOnTV()
        loadStreamingApp()
        setVolumeToLow()
    } else {
        // Default state handling
    }

    // Delay
    wait(0.1 seconds)
}
```

*   **Energy Management:** Utilize low-power modes for the 3D scanner and microphone array. Only activate them periodically or when significant changes in the environment are detected. Employ edge computing to process sensor data locally and reduce reliance on cloud connectivity.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** Implement on-device processing for environmental mapping and behavioral analysis to minimize data transmission. Provide users with clear controls over data collection and usage. Allow users to disable features or anonymize data.
*   **Refinement:** The system learns and refines its predictive accuracy over time. Integrate user feedback mechanisms to correct inaccurate predictions. Implement a confidence score for predictions. Only preemptively adjust the device state when the confidence score exceeds a certain threshold.
