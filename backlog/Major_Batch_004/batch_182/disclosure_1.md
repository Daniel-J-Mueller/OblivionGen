## Dynamic Key Derivation Host Allocation & Reputation

**Concept:** Extend the existing system with a dynamic allocation of key derivation hosts (KDHs) based on real-time reputation scores, incorporating a blockchain-based audit trail for share distribution and verification. This aims to increase security, availability, and resilience against compromised or malfunctioning KDHs.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Reputation System:**
    *   Each KDH maintains a reputation score, initially set to a default value.
    *   Reputation is updated based on:
        *   Successful share provision/verification (positive contribution).
        *   Failed share provision/verification (negative contribution).
        *   Response time to share requests.
        *   Uptime and resource availability.
        *   Audit trail verification (blockchain-based).
    *   Reputation calculation utilizes a weighted moving average to smooth out fluctuations and prioritize recent performance.

2.  **Dynamic KDH Allocation:**
    *   When provisioning a new encrypted volume:
        *   The system queries available KDHs and their current reputation scores.
        *   A weighted random selection algorithm picks KDHs, prioritizing those with higher reputation.
        *   The number of KDHs selected is configurable and adaptable based on security requirements.
    *   KDH selection considers geographical diversity to mitigate regional outages.

3.  **Blockchain Audit Trail:**
    *   Every share distribution event is recorded on a permissioned blockchain. This includes:
        *   Timestamp
        *   Encrypted Volume ID
        *   Share ID
        *   KDH ID
        *   Cryptographic hash of the share
        *   Digital signature of the provisioning service
    *   KDHs can independently verify the authenticity of their assigned shares by checking the blockchain.
    *   The blockchain serves as an immutable record of share distribution, enabling forensic analysis and identification of compromised KDHs.

4.  **Share Reconstruction Protocol Enhancement:**
    *   The share reconstruction process incorporates a verification step using the blockchain audit trail.
    *   Each submitted share is validated against the blockchain record to confirm its authenticity and prevent malicious shares from being used.
    *   A threshold signature scheme is employed to require a majority of legitimate KDHs to sign the reconstructed secret, further enhancing security.

5.  **Automated KDH Removal & Replacement:**
    *   If a KDH’s reputation falls below a predefined threshold, it’s automatically removed from the pool of eligible hosts.
    *   The system automatically provisions a replacement KDH and redistributes shares to maintain the required redundancy.

**Pseudocode (Share Distribution):**

```
function DistributeShares(VolumeID, KeyMaterial, NumberOfShares, Threshold) {
  KDHList = GetAvailableKDHs(); // Retrieve list of available KDHs with reputation scores
  SelectedKDHs = SelectKDHs(KDHList, NumberOfShares); // Weighted random selection

  ShareList = SplitSecret(KeyMaterial, NumberOfShares, Threshold);

  for each KDH in SelectedKDHs {
    Share = ShareList[KDH.ID];
    EncryptedShare = EncryptShare(Share, KDH.PublicKey);
    RecordShareDistribution(VolumeID, KDH.ID, EncryptedShare, Hash(EncryptedShare)); // Record on blockchain
    SendShare(KDH, EncryptedShare);
  }
}
```

**Infrastructure Requirements:**

*   Blockchain platform (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda)
*   Secure communication channels between provisioning service and KDHs
*   Reputation management service
*   Automated KDH provisioning and de-provisioning infrastructure
