## Adaptive SCM Bank Interleaving with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust SCM bank interleaving based on observed access patterns *and* predict future access patterns to proactively prefetch data, minimizing stall times beyond those already measured.  This moves beyond reactive optimization to a proactive, predictive system.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware Components:**
    *   **Access Pattern Monitor (APM):** Dedicated hardware block observing memory access requests (address lines) from the memory controller. APM creates a historical access pattern table. Table entries include: recent access addresses, frequency of access, temporal locality (time since last access).  Utilizes a Bloom filter to reduce memory footprint.
    *   **Prediction Engine (PE):**  A lightweight neural network (e.g., a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a limited number of layers and parameters) trained on data from the APM. PE predicts the *next* few memory addresses likely to be accessed, along with a confidence score.
    *   **Bank Interleaving Controller (BIC):**  Controls the physical mapping of memory addresses to SCM banks. Can dynamically re-map addresses to optimize for predicted access patterns.
    *   **Prefetch Queue (PQ):**  Small, high-speed buffer for pre-fetched data. 
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **Training Module:** Periodically trains the PE using data accumulated by the APM.  This could be done in the background, or during idle periods.
    *   **Configuration Interface:** Allows for tuning of parameters, such as the size of the APM table, the complexity of the PE, and the aggressiveness of prefetching.
*   **Operational Flow:**
    1.  **Monitoring:** APM continuously monitors memory access requests and builds the access pattern table.
    2.  **Prediction:** PE analyzes the access pattern table and predicts future access addresses, assigning a confidence score to each prediction.
    3.  **Bank Interleaving Adjustment:** BIC dynamically adjusts the bank interleaving based on the predicted access pattern. The goal is to place frequently accessed data on different banks to maximize parallelism.
    4.  **Prefetching:** For predictions with a confidence score exceeding a threshold, BIC initiates a prefetch request to load the predicted data into the PQ.
    5.  **Data Delivery:** When the memory controller requests data, the BIC first checks the PQ. If the data is present, itâ€™s delivered immediately. Otherwise, the data is fetched from the SCM.
    6.  **Feedback Loop:** The success or failure of prefetching (i.e., whether the predicted data was actually accessed) is fed back to the PE to refine its predictions.

**Pseudocode (PE Prediction):**

```
function predict_next_addresses(access_pattern_table):
  # Input: access_pattern_table (recent access history)
  # Output: list of predicted addresses, confidence scores

  # 1. Feature extraction from access_pattern_table (e.g., frequency, recency)
  features = extract_features(access_pattern_table)

  # 2. Run features through trained neural network (PE)
  predictions = PE.predict(features) # Returns predicted addresses & confidence

  # 3. Filter predictions based on confidence threshold
  filtered_predictions = []
  for pred, conf in predictions:
    if conf > CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
      filtered_predictions.append((pred, conf))

  return filtered_predictions
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Predictive Bank Interleaving:** Goes beyond static or reactive bank interleaving to proactively optimize the mapping based on predicted access patterns.
*   **Confidence-Based Prefetching:** Prefetches data only when the prediction confidence is high, minimizing wasted bandwidth.
*   **Integrated Hardware/Software:** Combines dedicated hardware for performance monitoring and prediction with software for training and configuration.
*   **Lightweight Neural Network:** Utilizes a small, efficient neural network to minimize resource consumption.
