## Adaptive Contextual Risk Scoring & Dynamic Plugin Orchestration

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting context validation plugin execution order and weighting based on real-time risk scoring of incoming requests.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of a static plugin order or a simple quorum, we introduce a risk engine that analyzes request characteristics and dynamically prioritizes and weights context validation plugins.  This adapts to changing threat landscapes and optimizes for both security and performance.

**Components:**

1.  **Risk Engine:**
    *   Input: Raw request data (user, timestamp, requested action, data involved).
    *   Processing:  Machine learning model (trained on historical data – successful requests, blocked requests, false positives) assigns a risk score to the request. Features considered:
        *   User behavior anomalies (deviation from typical access patterns).
        *   Geographic location anomalies.
        *   Time of day/week anomalies.
        *   Data sensitivity.
        *   Request frequency.
    *   Output: Risk Score (0.0 - 1.0).

2.  **Dynamic Plugin Orchestrator:**
    *   Input: Risk Score, List of available context validation plugins.
    *   Processing:
        *   **Plugin Prioritization:** Plugins are ranked based on their relevance to the current risk score.  Plugins that address high-risk factors are prioritized.  Example: if the risk score indicates potential data exfiltration, plugins focusing on data access control are moved to the top of the execution list.
        *   **Plugin Weighting:** Each plugin is assigned a weight based on the risk score and its relevance. Higher weights mean the plugin’s decision carries more influence in the final allow/deny determination.  This is not a simple boolean, but a confidence level.
        *   **Adaptive Quorum:** The traditional quorum is replaced with a weighted sum.  A request is allowed only if the weighted sum of affirmative plugin decisions exceeds a dynamic threshold determined by the risk score.  Higher risk scores require a higher weighted sum for approval.
    *   Output:  Dynamically ordered list of plugins to execute, weights for each plugin, dynamic quorum threshold.

3.  **Context Validation Plugins (Existing and New):** Plugins perform their usual context validation, providing an 'allowance score' (0.0-1.0) instead of just a boolean.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Plugin Orchestrator):**

```
function orchestrate_request(request_data):
  risk_score = calculate_risk_score(request_data)

  plugin_list = get_available_plugins()

  # Prioritize plugins based on risk score and relevance.  (Implementation detail - Relevance defined by tags/metadata on the plugin itself)
  prioritized_plugin_list = prioritize_plugins(plugin_list, risk_score)

  #Assign Weights (higher risk = more weight to security-focused plugins)
  weighted_plugin_list = assign_weights(prioritized_plugin_list, risk_score)

  #Calculate Dynamic Quorum Threshold (Risk score influences threshold)
  quorum_threshold = calculate_quorum_threshold(risk_score)

  #Execute plugins in order
  total_allowance = 0
  for plugin in weighted_plugin_list:
    allowance_score = plugin.validate(request_data)
    total_allowance += allowance_score * plugin.weight

  #Determine if request is allowed
  if total_allowance >= quorum_threshold:
    return ALLOWED
  else:
    return DENIED
```

**New Plugin Category:  Threat Intelligence Feed Integration:**

*   This plugin type integrates with external threat intelligence feeds (e.g., IP reputation lists, known malicious patterns).  It adds a layer of dynamic risk assessment based on external factors. This isn't a static rule, but real-time data.

**Benefits:**

*   **Adaptive Security:** Responds to evolving threats and user behavior patterns.
*   **Reduced False Positives:** More nuanced decision-making based on weighted scores.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Prioritization reduces the number of plugins executed for low-risk requests.
*   **Scalability:** Enables granular control over access without sacrificing performance.
