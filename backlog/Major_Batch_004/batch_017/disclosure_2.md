## Dynamic Favicon Threat Indicators

**Concept:** Expand the favicon notification system to incorporate real-time threat intelligence, going beyond simple certificate expiration warnings. The favicon becomes a dynamic indicator of overall website security posture, leveraging external threat feeds and server-side health checks.

**Specs:**

1.  **Threat Feed Integration:**
    *   System subscribes to multiple threat intelligence feeds (e.g., abuseipdb, virustotal, emerging threats).
    *   Server-side component continuously evaluates the website’s IP address, domain, and associated files against these feeds.
    *   Severity levels assigned to threat matches (low, medium, high, critical).

2.  **Favicon Color Mapping:**
    *   Color scheme established to represent threat levels:
        *   Green: No active threats detected.
        *   Yellow: Low/Medium threat indicators present (e.g., historical spam reports, outdated software versions).
        *   Orange: Medium/High threat indicators (e.g., recent malware associations, suspicious DNS records).
        *   Red: Critical threat indicators (e.g., active malware distribution, known command and control server).
        *   Grey: Certificate expired/expiring soon (existing functionality maintained).

3.  **Server-Side Logic:**
    ```pseudocode
    function updateFaviconColor(threatLevel, certificateStatus):
      if threatLevel == "critical":
        color = "red"
      else if threatLevel == "high":
        color = "orange"
      else if threatLevel == "medium":
        color = "yellow"
      else if threatLevel == "low":
        color = "yellow"
      else:
        color = "green"

      if certificateStatus == "expired" or certificateStatus == "expiring_soon":
        color = "grey"

      return color

    function handleClientRequest(clientRequest):
      threatLevel = getThreatLevel(clientRequest.ipAddress)
      certificateStatus = getCertificateStatus()
      faviconColor = updateFaviconColor(threatLevel, certificateStatus)
      sendFaviconData(clientRequest, faviconColor)
    ```

4.  **Client-Side Implementation:**
    *   JavaScript code monitors favicon element.
    *   Upon receiving updated color data from the server, the favicon’s color is dynamically changed.
    *   Optional: Tooltip displayed on favicon hover, explaining the current security status.

5.  **Additional Indicators:**
    *   Animated favicon (e.g., pulsing) to indicate active threats.
    *   Favicon shape changes to represent different threat types (e.g., shield for compromised account, lock for data breach).

6.  **Configuration:**
    *   Admin panel for configuring threat feed sources, color mappings, and animation settings.
    *   Ability to whitelist specific IP addresses or domains.
    *   Threshold adjustments for threat severity levels.
