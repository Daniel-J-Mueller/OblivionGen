**Emotional Resonance Mapping for Textual Analysis**

**Concept:** Expand the pattern recognition of the existing system to incorporate emotional content. Rather than just identifying *how* text is structured, this system maps *what* the text evokes emotionally. This isn't sentiment analysis (positive/negative) but a more granular mapping of evoked emotions.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Emotion Lexicon Expansion:** Create a vastly expanded lexicon mapping words, phrases, and sentence structures to a multidimensional emotional space (e.g., using Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions as a base – Joy, Trust, Fear, Surprise, Sadness, Disgust, Anger, Anticipation – with sub-gradients for each).  This lexicon must go beyond simple keyword matching and incorporate contextual understanding.

2.  **Neural Network Architecture:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units. The input layer will receive word embeddings.  An additional attention mechanism will focus on phrases carrying the highest emotional weight.

3.  **Emotional Feature Extraction:**
    *   **Emotional Trajectory:** Track the *change* in emotional state throughout the text. A flat emotional state might indicate robotic writing.  Rapid, illogical shifts might signal manipulation or incoherence.
    *   **Emotional Intensity:**  Measure the strength of each evoked emotion.  Overly dramatic or emotionally sterile text could indicate machine generation.
    *   **Emotional Coherence:** Assess whether the emotional responses are logically consistent with the narrative.

4.  **“Emotional Fingerprint” Creation:** For both machine-generated and human-written samples, generate a unique “emotional fingerprint” represented as a vector in the multidimensional emotional space. This will include not just the dominant emotions but also the distribution of emotional intensities and the trajectory of emotional change.

5.  **Anomaly Detection:**  Train a separate anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) on the emotional fingerprints of known human-written text. This algorithm will identify texts with emotional fingerprints significantly different from the established norm, flagging them as potentially machine-generated.

6.  **Integration with Existing System:** The emotional analysis module will be integrated with the existing pattern recognition system. The combined score (pattern analysis + emotional analysis) will be used to determine the likelihood of machine generation.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
FUNCTION analyze_text(text):
  emotional_fingerprint = calculate_emotional_fingerprint(text)
  pattern_score = existing_system.analyze(text)
  anomaly_score = anomaly_detector.score(emotional_fingerprint)

  combined_score = (0.6 * pattern_score) + (0.4 * (1 - anomaly_score)) // Weights can be tuned

  IF combined_score > threshold:
    RETURN "Machine Generated"
  ELSE:
    RETURN "Human Written"
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION calculate_emotional_fingerprint(text):
  // 1. Tokenize Text
  // 2. Word Embeddings
  // 3. LSTM with Attention (Emotional Weighting)
  // 4. Extract Emotional Trajectory, Intensity, Coherence
  // 5. Return Emotional Fingerprint Vector
ENDFUNCTION

```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Personalized Emotional Models:** Train separate emotional models for different writing styles and genres.
*   **Cross-Lingual Emotional Analysis:** Adapt the system to analyze text in multiple languages.
*   **Real-Time Analysis:** Implement the system for real-time analysis of text input.
