# 11804248

## Dynamic Temporal Segmentation for Enhanced Content Analysis

**Specification:** A system and method for dynamically segmenting video content based on detected ‘event density’ in conjunction with the timecoding scheme described in patent 11804248. This isn't simply about assigning timecodes *to* frames, but about using timecodes as anchors for intelligent content breakdown.

**Core Concept:**  Rather than treating video as a continuous stream, the system analyzes the visual and/or auditory information *within* each time period (as defined by the patent’s indexing) to determine a ‘density score’ representing the amount of significant activity.  This score drives dynamic temporal segmentation.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **High-Performance Compute Cluster:**  For real-time analysis of video streams.
*   **GPU Acceleration:**  For accelerated feature extraction and machine learning inference.
*   **Storage Array:** High-bandwidth, low-latency storage for raw video and analyzed data.

**Software Modules:**

*   **Feature Extractor:**  Identifies visual features (e.g., object detection, motion vectors, scene changes) and auditory features (e.g., speech activity, sound events).  Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models.
*   **Event Density Calculator:**  Aggregates feature data within each time period (as defined by the timecoding scheme). Assigns a density score based on the number and significance of detected events.  Customizable weighting parameters.
*   **Segmentation Engine:**  Analyzes the density score time series.  Identifies segments where the density score exceeds a pre-defined threshold or exhibits significant changes.
*   **Timecode Anchor Manager:** Maintains a mapping between the dynamically determined segment boundaries and the original timecodes.
*   **Metadata Generator:**  Attaches the segment boundaries and associated metadata (e.g., segment type, event summaries) to the video stream.

**Pseudocode (Segmentation Engine):**

```
function segmentVideo(densityScores, threshold, minSegmentDuration):
  segments = []
  currentSegmentStart = 0
  currentSegmentEnd = 0
  
  for i = 0 to length(densityScores) - 1:
    if densityScores[i] > threshold:
      if currentSegmentEnd == 0:
        currentSegmentEnd = i
      else:
        #extend existing segment
        currentSegmentEnd = i
    else:
      if currentSegmentEnd != 0:
        #Segment complete, check duration
        duration = currentSegmentEnd - currentSegmentStart
        if duration >= minSegmentDuration:
          segments.append((currentSegmentStart, currentSegmentEnd))
        currentSegmentStart = 0
        currentSegmentEnd = 0
  
  #Handle any remaining segment at end of video
  if currentSegmentEnd != 0:
    duration = currentSegmentEnd - currentSegmentStart
    if duration >= minSegmentDuration:
      segments.append((currentSegmentStart, currentSegmentEnd))
  
  return segments
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  The video stream is decoded.
2.  The timecoding scheme assigns initial timecodes to frames.
3.  The Feature Extractor analyzes each frame (or a representative set of frames) within each time period.
4.  The Event Density Calculator aggregates the features and assigns a density score to the time period.
5.  The Segmentation Engine analyzes the density score time series and identifies segments.
6.  The Timecode Anchor Manager aligns segment boundaries with the original timecodes.
7.  The Metadata Generator attaches segment metadata to the video stream.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Smart Video Editing:** Automated generation of highlights reels or trailers.
*   **Content-Aware Video Compression:**  Adaptive bitrate allocation based on segment complexity.
*   **Advanced Video Search:**  Search by event type or segment content.
*   **Automated Storyboarding:**  Extraction of keyframes for storyboarding purposes.
*   **Real-Time Event Detection:** Identification of significant events as they occur.
