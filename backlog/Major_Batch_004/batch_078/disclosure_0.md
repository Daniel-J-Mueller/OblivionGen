## Dynamic Code Graph Embedding for Cross-Language Similarity

**Concept:** Extend the logic tree comparison beyond simple structural matching. Instead, generate a dynamic, vector-based embedding of the code graph (formed from the logic tree) which captures semantic meaning, allowing for more robust cross-language code similarity detection. This addresses the limitation of relying solely on syntactic structure.

**Specs:**

1.  **Code Graph Generation:**
    *   Input: Source code segment (any language).
    *   Process: Parse source code to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Convert the AST into a directed graph where nodes represent code elements (variables, functions, operators, etc.) and edges represent relationships (control flow, data dependency, inheritance).
    *   Output: Code Graph (directed graph representation).

2.  **Node Feature Extraction:**
    *   Input: Code Graph.
    *   Process: For each node in the graph:
        *   Tokenize the associated code element.
        *   Utilize a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, CodeBERT) to generate a vector embedding for the tokenized code element.  This captures semantic meaning.  Consider fine-tuning the model on a code corpus.
        *   Incorporate static analysis data (e.g., data type, scope) as additional features.
    *   Output: Node Feature Vectors (a vector associated with each node in the graph).

3.  **Graph Embedding Generation:**
    *   Input: Code Graph, Node Feature Vectors.
    *   Process: Employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN) – specifically, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) or Graph Attention Network (GAT) – to generate a graph embedding.  The GNN will aggregate information from neighboring nodes to create a contextualized representation of the entire graph.  Utilize a pooling layer (e.g., global average pooling) to reduce the dimensionality of the embedding.
    *   Output: Code Graph Embedding (a fixed-size vector representing the entire code graph).

4.  **Similarity Calculation:**
    *   Input: Two Code Graph Embeddings (representing two code segments).
    *   Process: Calculate the cosine similarity between the two embeddings.  A higher cosine similarity indicates a higher degree of semantic similarity between the code segments.
    *   Output: Similarity Score (a value between 0 and 1, representing the similarity between the two code segments).

5.  **Cross-Language Compatibility:**
    *   The pre-trained language model should be trained on a multi-lingual code corpus (if feasible) or adapted using techniques like cross-lingual embeddings. This facilitates comparison of code segments written in different programming languages.

6.  **Data Store Integration:**
    *   Instead of storing only the logic tree, store the Code Graph Embedding in the data store alongside metadata.
    *   The index value is still derived from the code structure, but the matching process utilizes the embedding similarity score.

**Pseudocode (Matching Process):**

```
function matchCodeSegment(queryCode, dataStore):
  queryGraph = generateCodeGraph(queryCode)
  queryEmbedding = generateGraphEmbedding(queryGraph)
  indexValue = hash(queryGraph)
  storedEntries = dataStore.getEntries(indexValue)

  bestMatch = null
  highestSimilarity = -1

  for entry in storedEntries:
    storedEmbedding = entry.graphEmbedding
    similarity = cosineSimilarity(queryEmbedding, storedEmbedding)

    if similarity > highestSimilarity:
      highestSimilarity = similarity
      bestMatch = entry

  if highestSimilarity > threshold: // Define a threshold for matching
    return bestMatch, highestSimilarity
  else:
    return null, 0
```

This system enhances the original patent by moving beyond structural matching to incorporate semantic understanding, enabling cross-language code similarity detection and more accurate results. It addresses the limitations of only comparing logic trees by factoring in the *meaning* of the code, rather than just its structure.
