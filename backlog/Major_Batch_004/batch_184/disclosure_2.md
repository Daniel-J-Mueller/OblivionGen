## Adaptive Network Topology via Bio-Inspired Growth

**Concept:** Implement a network topology that *grows* and adapts based on simulated biological principles – specifically, branching patterns found in fungal networks or plant root systems.  Instead of nodes simply connecting to maximize immediate information exchange, the network ‘explores’ connection possibilities based on a simulated ‘nutrient’ (data) demand, prioritizing growth towards areas with high ‘demand’ and limited ‘supply’.

**Specs:**

*   **Node Types:**
    *   **Source Nodes:** Generate data ‘nutrients’ with varying rates and types.  These have a fixed ‘emission strength’.
    *   **Relay Nodes:**  Propagate ‘nutrients’ received from other nodes.  These nodes have variable ‘conductivity’ based on load.
    *   **Sink Nodes:** Consume ‘nutrients’.  Have variable ‘absorption rates’ signifying demand.

*   **Connection Mechanism:**
    *   Nodes don’t directly request connections. Instead, they emit ‘growth signals’.
    *   Nodes ‘listen’ for growth signals from other nodes.  Signal strength diminishes with distance (simulated physical distance or network hops).
    *   When a node receives a strong growth signal *and* has available ‘growth capacity’ (limited by resource constraints), it initiates a connection request.
    *   Connection acceptance is not guaranteed. It’s probabilistic, weighted by:
        *   Signal strength
        *   Current node load (avoiding congestion)
        *   Diversity of connected nodes (encouraging redundancy).

*   **‘Nutrient’ Model:**
    *   Data is represented as ‘nutrients’ with different ‘types’ (e.g., high bandwidth, low latency, critical data).
    *   Each node has a ‘nutrient preference’ and ‘tolerance’.
    *   Nutrient flow through a connection is governed by a simulated ‘vascular resistance’ – influenced by connection quality and node load.
    *   Nodes ‘report’ nutrient deficits to neighboring nodes, triggering localized growth responses.

*   **Growth Algorithm:**
    *   Initialization: Random initial connections.
    *   Iteration:
        1.  Source nodes emit nutrients.
        2.  Relay nodes propagate nutrients.
        3.  Sink nodes consume nutrients and report deficits.
        4.  Nodes listen for growth signals and initiate connections.
        5.  Connections are established probabilistically based on signal strength, load, and diversity.
        6.  Connection quality is adjusted based on nutrient flow and load.

*   **Pseudocode (Growth Iteration):**

```
FOR EACH Node IN Network:
    IF Node IS Source:
        Emit Nutrient(Type, Strength)
    ELSE IF Node IS Sink:
        Demand = CalculateDemand()
        ReportDeficit(Demand)
    END IF

FOR EACH Node IN Network:
    FOR EACH Neighbor IN PotentialNeighbors:
        SignalStrength = ReceiveSignal(Neighbor)
        IF SignalStrength > Threshold AND Node.GrowthCapacity > 0:
            Probability = CalculateConnectionProbability(SignalStrength, Node.Load, Node.ConnectedNodes)
            IF Random(0, 1) < Probability:
                EstablishConnection(Neighbor)
                Node.GrowthCapacity -= 1
            END IF
        END IF
    END FOR
END FOR

FOR EACH Connection IN Network:
    UpdateConnectionQuality(DataFlow, Load)
END FOR
```

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   Node: ID, Type, Load, GrowthCapacity, ConnectedNodes, NutrientPreference, NutrientTolerance
    *   Connection: SourceNodeID, DestinationNodeID, Quality, DataFlow, Load

*   **Scalability:** Implement a hierarchical structure, where nodes form clusters that connect to super-nodes, enabling scaling to large networks.
