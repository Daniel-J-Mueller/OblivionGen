## Dynamic Attribute Weighting via User Interaction History

**Concept:** Augment the system to dynamically adjust attribute weights based on observed user interactions. The existing patent focuses on identifying relevant attributes; this extends it by *learning* which attributes are most valuable *to individual users* over time. This shifts the focus from static relevance to personalized, adaptive responses.

**Specs:**

1.  **User Interaction Logging:** 
    *   Each user session is tagged with a unique identifier.
    *   Log all user actions related to responses: 
        *   Explicit feedback (thumbs up/down, star ratings).
        *   Implicit feedback (response dwell time, rephrasing of the original query after receiving a response).
        *   Selection of follow-up queries after a response.
2.  **Attribute Preference Vectors:**
    *   Maintain an attribute preference vector for each user.  This vector will store a weight for each attribute.
    *   Initialization:  Initialize all weights to a neutral value (e.g., 0.5).
3.  **Weight Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   After each user interaction, update the attribute preference vector.
    *   Algorithm:

        ```pseudocode
        function update_attribute_weights(user_id, attribute, feedback_score):
            user_vector = get_user_attribute_vector(user_id)
            current_weight = user_vector[attribute]
            learning_rate = 0.01  // Adjustable parameter
            
            new_weight = current_weight + learning_rate * (feedback_score - 0.5) //Scale Feedback to -1 to 1
            
            //Constrain weights between 0 and 1
            new_weight = max(0, min(1, new_weight))
            
            user_vector[attribute] = new_weight
            save_user_attribute_vector(user_id, user_vector)
        ```

4.  **Response Ranking Modification:**
    *   Modify the attribute scoring component to incorporate user-specific weights.
    *   Original Score: `Attribute Score = (Relevance Score from Model) * (Static Attribute Importance)`
    *   Modified Score: `Attribute Score = (Relevance Score from Model) * (User-Specific Attribute Weight)`
5.  **Cold Start Mitigation:**
    *   For new users with no interaction history, use a global average attribute weight (calculated from all users).
    *   Gradually transition to user-specific weights as interaction data accumulates.
6.  **A/B Testing Framework:**
    *   Implement an A/B testing framework to evaluate the performance of the dynamic weighting algorithm against the baseline (static weights).
    *   Metrics: 
        *   User satisfaction (explicit feedback).
        *   Response selection rate.
        *   Session length.
        *   Task completion rate.



**Implementation Details:**

*   The `feedback_score` could be normalized explicit feedback (e.g., 0 for thumbs down, 1 for thumbs up) or derived from implicit signals (e.g., dwell time).
*   The `learning_rate` controls how quickly the weights adapt to new data.  It should be tuned based on experimentation.
*   Data storage for user attribute vectors could be a key-value store or a relational database.
*   The system should be scalable to handle a large number of users and attributes.
