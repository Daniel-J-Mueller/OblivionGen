## Dynamic Content Stitching & Predictive Pre-Caching

**Concept:** Extend the queue management system to dynamically stitch content segments *before* they reach the queue, and proactively pre-cache these stitched segments based on predicted user behavior. This creates a seamless, near-instantaneous playback experience, minimizing buffering and maximizing engagement.

**Specification:**

**1. Content Segmentation Module:**

*   **Function:**  Analyzes source content (video, audio, live streams) and segments it into small, independently decodable units – “Content Primitives” (CPs).
*   **Input:** Source content file/stream URL.
*   **Output:** A manifest file mapping CPs, their dependencies (audio tracks, subtitles), and stitching points.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ scene detection algorithms to identify natural break points.
    *   Utilize AI to analyze content and identify segments suitable for remixing (e.g., intro/outro sections, filler content).
    *   Generate unique IDs for each CP.

**2. Stitching Engine:**

*   **Function:** Dynamically assembles CPs based on user context, queue actions, and pre-defined stitching rules.
*   **Input:**  CP Manifest, User Context (preferences, location, device), Queue Actions, Stitching Rules.
*   **Output:**  A continuous, stitched content stream (e.g., DASH manifest, HLS playlist).
*   **Process:**
    *   Retrieve CPs from a content delivery network (CDN) based on the manifest.
    *   Apply stitching rules (e.g., insert ad breaks, swap segments, add intros/outros).
    *   Transcode and package the stitched stream for the client device.

**3. Predictive Pre-Cache Module:**

*   **Function:** Anticipates user behavior and pre-caches likely content segments *before* they are requested.
*   **Input:** User History, Queue History, Content Metadata, Real-Time Context (time of day, location).
*   **Output:**  A pre-cached library of stitched content segments on the client device.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ machine learning models to predict the next content segment based on user history and current context.
    *   Prioritize pre-caching based on predicted likelihood and segment size.
    *   Implement a smart eviction policy to manage cache size.

**4. Queue Action Integration:**

*   Extend existing queue actions to control the stitching process.
    *   **“Skip Intro”:**  Removes the intro CP from the stitched stream.
    *   **“Add Filler”:** Inserts a pre-defined filler CP (e.g., a short promo) into the stream.
    *   **“Dynamic Ad Insertion”:**  Dynamically inserts an ad CP at a specified point in the stream.
    *   **“Personalized Content”:** Swaps segments with alternative versions based on user preferences.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Pre-Cache Module):**

```
function predict_next_segment(user_history, queue_history, content_metadata, real_time_context):
  // Train a machine learning model on historical data
  model = train_model(user_history, queue_history, content_metadata, real_time_context)

  // Predict the probability of each segment being the next segment
  segment_probabilities = model.predict(user_history, queue_history, content_metadata, real_time_context)

  // Sort segments by probability
  sorted_segments = sort_segments_by_probability(segment_probabilities)

  // Return the top N segments
  return sorted_segments[:N]

function pre_cache_segments(segments):
  // Download segments from CDN
  download_segments(segments)

  // Store segments in local cache
  store_segments_in_cache(segments)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Client-side caching requires sufficient storage capacity.
*   Powerful processors are needed for dynamic stitching and transcoding.
*   Fast network connectivity is essential for efficient content delivery.
