## Dynamic Tote Assignment & Proactive Content Prediction

**Concept:** Expand the virtual tote system to not only *manage* existing orders but to proactively *predict* and pre-populate totes based on user behavior, external data, and a learned 'consumption profile.'  Instead of the user building totes from scratch, the system anticipates needs and presents a partially filled tote, dramatically reducing user effort.

**Specs:**

**1. User Profile & Predictive Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate purchase history, browsing data (within & outside the network site), social media activity (optional, with consent), location data (optional, with consent – e.g., proximity to stores, weather), calendar integration (optional, with consent – e.g., upcoming events suggesting need for certain items).
*   **Consumption Profile:** Build a multi-dimensional consumption profile for each user.  This profile categorizes items (e.g., "breakfast foods," "cleaning supplies," "baby items") and assigns weights based on frequency, recency, and quantity.  A time-series component tracks consumption patterns (daily, weekly, monthly).
*   **Predictive Algorithm:** Implement a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering (users with similar profiles), content-based filtering (item attributes), and time-series forecasting.  The algorithm generates a probability distribution of items likely to be added to the next tote.

**2. Dynamic Tote Creation & Assignment:**

*   **Virtual Tote Pre-population:**  Prior to the user accessing the tote management interface, the system creates a ‘predicted tote’ populated with items from the probability distribution.  The number of items pre-populated is adjustable based on the user’s historical tote size and the confidence level of the predictions.
*   **Tote Splitting & Merging:** Allow the system to automatically split a single tote into multiple totes based on delivery schedules or location.  Conversely, merge totes scheduled for the same delivery address and day.
*   **"Smart" Tote Assignment:**  Based on predictive data, proactively assign items to the optimal tote based on scheduled delivery date, location, and the user’s known consumption patterns. For example, perishable items are automatically assigned to the earliest delivery.
*   **A/B Testing:** Incorporate A/B testing to measure the success of pre-populated totes versus traditional manual tote building based on user engagement, conversion rates, and tote order value.

**3. Interface Adaptations:**

*   **“Predicted Items” Section:**  A dedicated section within the tote management interface displays the predicted items. Users can easily add, remove, or adjust quantities.
*   **Confidence Score Visualization:**  Display a confidence score next to each predicted item indicating the system’s certainty.
*   **“Explain Prediction” Feature:** Allow users to view the factors influencing the prediction (e.g., “Based on your previous purchases of coffee and the current weather forecast”).
*    **“Surprise Me” Button:** A button that adds a random selection of highly-predicted items to the tote, encouraging discovery.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Predictive Algorithm):**

```
function predict_tote_items(user_id, delivery_date):
  user_profile = get_user_profile(user_id)
  historical_data = get_historical_data(user_id)

  // Calculate item probabilities based on:
  purchase_frequency = calculate_purchase_frequency(historical_data)
  seasonal_trends = calculate_seasonal_trends(historical_data, delivery_date)
  location_based_recommendations = get_location_based_recommendations(user_profile)
  social_influence = get_social_influence(user_profile)

  item_probabilities = combine_probabilities(purchase_frequency, seasonal_trends, location_based_recommendations, social_influence)

  predicted_items = select_top_n_items(item_probabilities, n=10) //Select top 10 items

  return predicted_items
```

**Expansion Points:**

*   Integration with smart home devices (e.g., automatically adding dish soap when the smart dishwasher detects low levels).
*   Personalized discounts and promotions on predicted items.
*   Proactive inventory management to ensure predicted items are in stock.
