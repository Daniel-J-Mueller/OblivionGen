## Adaptive Quantum-Classical Workflow Orchestration with Predictive Resource Allocation

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting the balance between quantum and classical computational resources *during* task execution, guided by real-time performance prediction and cost optimization.

**Core Innovation:** The patent details a system that *selects* quantum/classical resources *before* execution. This system *continuously* monitors performance metrics and adjusts resource allocation *during* execution.  It doesn’t just choose upfront; it *reacts* to changing conditions.

**System Components:**

1.  **Performance Monitoring Agent (PMA):** Integrated into both quantum and classical compute nodes.  Continuously collects metrics: execution time, qubit coherence, error rates, CPU/GPU utilization, memory access, network latency, and cost per cycle.

2.  **Predictive Model (PM):** A machine learning model (likely a recurrent neural network or transformer) trained on historical data from the PMA. It predicts future performance (execution time, error rates, cost) of both quantum and classical components for various sub-tasks.  This prediction incorporates the *interdependence* of quantum and classical operations. 

3.  **Workflow Orchestrator (WO):**  The central control unit. It receives the task description, splits it into sub-tasks, and initially assigns them to quantum or classical resources. It then continuously receives performance predictions from the PM and actual performance data from the PMA.  Based on this data, the WO dynamically re-allocates sub-tasks between quantum and classical resources to minimize overall execution time and cost.

4.  **Cost Function:** Defines the optimization goal.  A weighted sum of execution time, error rate, and cost. Weights are configurable, allowing users to prioritize speed, accuracy, or cost.

**Pseudocode (Workflow Orchestrator - Core Loop):**

```
INITIALIZE:
    Task = receive_task()
    Subtasks = split_task(Task)
    Initial_Allocation = assign_subtasks(Subtasks, Quantum_Resources, Classical_Resources)
    Current_Cost = calculate_cost(Initial_Allocation)

LOOP:
    For each Subtask in Subtasks:
        Predicted_Performance = PM.predict_performance(Subtask, Quantum_Resources, Classical_Resources)
        Actual_Performance = PMA.get_performance(Subtask)
        Cost_Delta = calculate_cost_delta(Subtask, Quantum_Resources, Classical_Resources, Actual_Performance, Predicted_Performance)
        
        If Cost_Delta < Threshold:  #Significant potential for improvement
            
            Optimal_Resource = determine_optimal_resource(Subtask, Quantum_Resources, Classical_Resources, Cost_Function)
            
            If Optimal_Resource != Current_Resource:
                Reallocate_Subtask(Subtask, Optimal_Resource)
                Update_Current_Cost()
    
    If Termination_Condition_Met():
        Break
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Subtask:** {ID, Dependencies, Estimated_Quantum_Cycles, Estimated_Classical_Cycles, Current_Resource}
*   **Resource:** {Type (Quantum/Classical), Availability, Performance_Metrics, Cost_Per_Cycle}
*   **Performance_Metrics:** {Execution_Time, Error_Rate, Utilization}

**Novelty:**  This isn’t merely a scheduler; it’s a *dynamic resource manager* that optimizes workflow during execution, adapting to the real-time performance characteristics of both quantum and classical resources. The predictive model allows for proactive re-allocation, minimizing the impact of errors or slowdowns. Existing systems focus on pre-allocation or static scheduling. This one *reacts*.
