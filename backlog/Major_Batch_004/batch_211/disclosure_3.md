## Dynamic Proximity-Based A/V Triggering & Collaborative Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the person-of-interest identification beyond simple notification to create a dynamic, collaborative, and reconstructive system leveraging distributed A/V data. Instead of just alerting when a person is *seen* by multiple devices, the system proactively anticipates potential sightings based on predicted movement patterns, requests targeted A/V capture from nearby devices, and then reconstructs a continuous, multi-perspective view of the person's activity.

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** “Proximity Anticipation Engine” – A predictive AI model trained on historical movement data (user-defined zones, common routes) and real-time data feeds (location services, known schedules).
*   **Device Roles:**
    *   *Initiator Device*: The device that initially identifies (or is instructed to search for) a person of interest.
    *   *Responder Devices*: Devices within a dynamically adjusting radius of the predicted path or location. These respond to requests from the Initiator.
    *   *Coordinator Device*:  A central server or edge computing node managing requests, data aggregation, and reconstruction.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Secure, low-latency mesh network (WiFi Direct, 5G) enabling direct device-to-device communication alongside server coordination.

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  **Initiation:** User designates a person of interest and a general area or potential route via a mobile app.
2.  **Prediction:** Proximity Anticipation Engine calculates a probability distribution for the person’s likely location over time.
3.  **Dynamic Radius Adjustment:** The system defines a dynamically adjusting radius around the predicted path, factoring in environmental conditions (obstructions, visibility), speed, and confidence level.
4.  **Responder Device Solicitation:** Responder Devices within the radius receive a “standby” request.  The request includes anonymized search parameters – “person matching X description, last seen heading Y direction.”
5.  **Targeted A/V Capture:**  When a Responder Device detects a potential match, it *selectively* initiates A/V capture (short clip + metadata – timestamp, location).  Privacy filters are applied to blur backgrounds or redact faces of non-targets.
6.  **Data Aggregation & Reconstruction:**  The Coordinator Device receives the A/V clips, timestamps, and location data. A multi-view video reconstruction algorithm (similar to photogrammetry) creates a continuous, panoramic view of the person's movement.
7.  **User Interface:**  The user receives a real-time, reconstructed view of the person’s activity on their mobile device or desktop. Tools allow them to rewind, fast forward, zoom, and filter the view.

**Pseudocode (Coordinator Device – Data Reconstruction):**

```
FUNCTION reconstruct_view(video_clips, metadata):
  // Input: List of video clips, corresponding metadata (timestamps, locations)

  SORT video_clips BY metadata.timestamp
  
  // Perform feature extraction on each frame of each clip
  features = EXTRACT_FEATURES(video_clips)
  
  // Perform camera pose estimation (using location data as initial guess)
  camera_poses = ESTIMATE_CAMERA_POSES(features, metadata)
  
  // Use Structure from Motion (SfM) or SLAM to create a 3D point cloud
  point_cloud = CREATE_POINT_CLOUD(features, camera_poses)

  // Texture the point cloud using the original video frames
  textured_model = TEXTURE_MODEL(point_cloud, video_clips, camera_poses)
  
  // Render a navigable 3D view or panoramic video
  RENDER_VIEW(textured_model)
  
  RETURN rendered_view
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Edge computing node with sufficient processing power for real-time video reconstruction.
*   High-bandwidth, low-latency network connectivity (5G, WiFi 6).
*   A/V devices equipped with GPS and accelerometers.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Security and surveillance
*   Lost person tracking
*   Real-time event monitoring
*   Remote assistance and guidance.
