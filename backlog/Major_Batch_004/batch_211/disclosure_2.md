## Dynamic Trust Scoring with Behavioral Biometrics & Decentralized Identity

**Core Concept:** Augment the existing two-factor authentication (2FA) system with a continuous, dynamic trust score based on behavioral biometrics, integrated with a decentralized identity (DID) system. This creates a near-seamless authentication experience, reducing reliance on static 2FA codes while bolstering security.

**System Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Biometrics Engine:**  A software component embedded within the HSM client (or a dedicated agent on the user’s device).  It collects passive behavioral data during normal computer/device usage.  This includes:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure, rhythm).
    *   Mouse movement patterns (speed, acceleration, common paths).
    *   Scrolling behavior (speed, patterns).
    *   Device orientation & movement (if mobile).
    *   Application usage patterns.
2.  **Trust Score Algorithm:**  A machine learning model trained on authenticated user behavior. It processes the behavioral biometric data in real-time, generating a trust score (0-100). The model continuously learns and adapts to individual user patterns.
3.  **Decentralized Identity (DID) Integration:**  User identity is managed through a DID system (e.g., using a blockchain or distributed ledger). The DID holds verifiable credentials, including a link to the user’s behavioral biometric profile (encrypted and stored securely).
4.  **HSM Policy Engine Enhancement:** The HSM’s policy engine is extended to incorporate the trust score. Policies define thresholds for access based on the score.  For example:
    *   Trust Score > 90: Access granted without additional 2FA.
    *   70 < Trust Score < 90:  Standard 2FA (TOTP, push notification) required.
    *   Trust Score < 70:  Stronger 2FA (biometric authentication, hardware key) required or access denied.
5. **Attestation Service:** A component that cryptographically attests the integrity of the Behavioral Biometrics Engine and its data collection process. This ensures that the trust score is based on genuine data, and not manipulated by malware or compromised software.



**Workflow:**

1.  **Enrollment:** During initial setup, the user performs typical actions (typing, mouse movements) while authenticated. This data is used to train the Trust Score Algorithm for that user.  The user’s DID is linked to their biometric profile.
2.  **Ongoing Monitoring:**  The Behavioral Biometrics Engine continuously collects data as the user interacts with their device.
3.  **Authentication Request:** When the user attempts to access the HSM, the system:
    *   Retrieves the user’s biometric profile from their DID.
    *   Calculates the current trust score based on real-time behavioral data.
    *   Checks the HSM policy based on the trust score.
    *   Grants or requests additional authentication factors accordingly.
4. **Periodic Re-Attestation:** The Attestation Service periodically verifies the integrity of the Behavioral Biometrics Engine and its data collection process. If any anomalies are detected, the trust score is temporarily reset, and stronger authentication is required.



**Pseudocode (Simplified HSM Policy Check):**

```
function checkHSMaccess(userID, trustScore) {
  policy = getHSMpolicy(userID)

  if (trustScore >= policy.highTrustThreshold) {
    accessGranted()
    return
  }

  if (trustScore >= policy.mediumTrustThreshold) {
    require2FA(userID, 2FAType.Standard)
    return
  }

  if (trustScore < policy.lowTrustThreshold) {
    require2FA(userID, 2FAType.Strong)
    return
  }

  denyAccess()
}
```

**Novelty:**  This approach moves beyond static 2FA by introducing continuous, dynamic authentication.  Integrating decentralized identity enhances user control and privacy.  The attestation service adds a layer of security to prevent manipulation of the biometric data. This offers a more seamless and secure user experience, reducing friction while strengthening overall security posture.
