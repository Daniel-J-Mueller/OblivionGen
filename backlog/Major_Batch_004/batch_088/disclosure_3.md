## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Classification for Personalized RES Masking

**Concept:** Integrate acoustic scene classification into the RES algorithm to dynamically adjust masking behavior *beyond* just ERLE thresholds. This allows for more intelligent, context-aware residual echo suppression, improving speech quality in diverse environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing microphone array, processor capable of real-time audio processing, and memory for storing acoustic models. No additional hardware required.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Scene Classifier (ASC):** Trained on a dataset of diverse acoustic environments (e.g., office, car, street, home). Employs a deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) to classify the current acoustic scene based on input audio. Outputs a probability distribution over scene classes.
    *   **RES Adaptation Engine:** Modifies the RES masking behavior based on the output of the ASC. This engine maps scene classes (or probabilities) to specific RES parameters.
    *   **RES Parameter Sets:** Predefined sets of parameters for the RES algorithm, tailored to different acoustic scenes.  Parameters include:
        *   Attenuation curve slope and intercept.
        *   Smoothing window sizes (time/frequency).
        *   Adaptive filter learning rate.
        *   Thresholds for ERLE-based masking.
    *   **Blending Function:** Combines the ERLE-based masking with the scene-adapted masking to create a final RES mask.

**Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
// Initialization
Train ASC model on diverse acoustic scene dataset
Define RES Parameter Sets for each acoustic scene
Define Blending Function parameters (weighting factors)

// Real-time Processing Loop
Receive audio input from microphone array
Classify acoustic scene using ASC
scene_probabilities = ASC(audio_input)
scene_index = argmax(scene_probabilities) // Select most probable scene
scene_parameters = RES_Parameter_Sets[scene_index]

// ERLE-Based Masking (as in original patent)
ERLE = Calculate_ERLE(audio_input)
if ERLE > Threshold_High:
    attenuation = Full_Attenuation
elif ERLE < Threshold_Low:
    attenuation = Reduced_Attenuation
else:
    attenuation = Intermediate_Attenuation

// Scene-Adapted Masking
scene_attenuation = scene_parameters.attenuation_curve(frequency)

// Blend Maskings
final_mask = (1 - Blending_Weight) * ERLE_mask + Blending_Weight * scene_attenuation

// Apply RES mask to error signal
output_signal = Apply_RES_Mask(error_signal, final_mask)
```

**Refinements:**

*   **Probabilistic Scene Blending:** Use the probability distribution output by the ASC to weight the blending of different scene-adapted masks.  Instead of a single scene, blend multiple masks based on their probabilities.
*   **User Personalization:** Incorporate user-specific preferences into the RES adaptation engine. For example, users might prefer more aggressive echo suppression in certain situations.
*   **Dynamic Blending Weight:** Adjust the `Blending_Weight` parameter based on the confidence of the ASC classification.  Higher confidence means more weight on the scene-adapted mask.
*   **Hybrid Approach**: Use the ASC to guide selection of a *different* adaptive filter structure (e.g., switching between block LMS and frequency domain adaptive filtering) beyond simply adjusting mask parameters.
