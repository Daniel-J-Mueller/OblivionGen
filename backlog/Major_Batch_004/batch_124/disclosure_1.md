## Dynamic Widget Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the property vector validation system to incorporate “widget personas” – predefined behavioral profiles – allowing for testing beyond simple functional correctness, encompassing expected user interaction patterns and resilience to unexpected input.

**Specification:**

**1. Persona Definition:**

*   **Persona Files:** Introduce a file format (e.g., JSON, YAML) to define widget personas. Each persona includes:
    *   `persona_id`: Unique identifier for the persona.
    *   `description`: Human-readable description of the persona (e.g., “Power User,” “Novice,” “Malicious Actor”).
    *   `interaction_sequences`: A list of ordered interaction sequences. Each sequence consists of:
        *   `action_type`: The type of user action (e.g., “click,” “type,” “hover,” “scroll”).
        *   `target_element`: Identifier (XPath, CSS selector) of the target element.
        *   `input_value`: (Optional) Input value for the action (e.g., text to type).
        *   `delay`: (Optional) Delay in seconds between actions.
    *   `validation_rules`: A set of rules that define the expected state of the widget *after* the interaction sequence. These are expressed as property vector comparisons, but can also include more complex assertions (e.g., "element X is visible," "error message Y is displayed").
*   **Persona Library:** A centralized repository to store and manage widget personas.

**2. Test Execution Framework:**

*   **Persona Selection:** Before executing tests, the framework allows selection of one or more personas.
*   **Interaction Sequence Application:** The framework iterates through the interaction sequences defined in the selected persona(s).
    *   For each action, the framework simulates the corresponding user interaction with the widget.
    *   After each action, the framework extracts the current property vector.
    *   The current property vector is compared against the expected state defined in the validation rules for that action.
*   **Dynamic Property Vector Updates:**  Instead of *only* comparing to a baseline, the validation rules can include transformations to the baseline property vector *based on* prior actions. This allows for more realistic modeling of state changes.  For example:
    *   If a user clicks a button, the validation rule might check for a change in a specific property, or the appearance of a new element.
*   **Fault Injection:** The framework incorporates fault injection capabilities. This allows for simulating unexpected inputs or errors, to test the resilience of the widget. Examples:
    *   Sending invalid data to a form field.
    *   Simulating network errors.
    *   Injecting delays or interruptions.

**3. Property Vector Enhancement:**

*   **Contextual Property Vectors:** Extend the property vector to include contextual information, such as:
    *   Browser type and version.
    *   Operating system.
    *   Screen resolution.
    *   User locale.
*   **Statistical Property Vectors:** Instead of just comparing exact property vector values, use statistical comparisons (e.g., compare the mean and standard deviation of certain properties).

**Pseudocode (Test Execution):**

```
function execute_test(widget, persona, baseline_property_vector):
    current_property_vector = baseline_property_vector

    for sequence in persona.interaction_sequences:
        simulate_action(widget, sequence.action_type, sequence.target_element, sequence.input_value, sequence.delay)
        current_property_vector = extract_property_vector(widget)

        if not compare_property_vectors(current_property_vector, sequence.validation_rules):
            report_failure(sequence.action_type, sequence.target_element, sequence.validation_rules)
            return false

    return true
```

**Engineer Notes:**

*   This system requires a robust mechanism for simulating user interactions with the widget.
*   The property vector extraction process needs to be optimized for performance.
*   The validation rule language should be flexible enough to express complex assertions.
*   The system should be designed to be easily extensible, allowing for the addition of new personas, actions, and validation rules.
