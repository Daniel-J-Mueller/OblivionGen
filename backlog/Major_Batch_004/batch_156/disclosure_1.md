## Dynamic Predictive Zoom & Interaction Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the screenshot-based preview system to incorporate *predictive* zoom levels based on user interaction patterns and dynamically map those interactions onto the full page content *before* full load completion.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Prediction Module (Server-Side):**

*   **Interaction Logging:** Server logs aggregate user interaction data (scroll speed, zoom level, click/tap locations, dwell time) across multiple instances of page previews. Data is anonymized and associated with preview “tiles” (screenshots).
*   **Behavioral Modeling:** A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM recurrent neural network) learns predictive interaction patterns for different page layouts and content types. It predicts likely zoom levels and interaction points based on initial preview tile and user demographics/past behavior.
*   **Tile Generation & Zoom Level Assignment:** Generate preview tiles.  Alongside each tile, assign a predicted zoom level (0.5x to 2.0x) and a heatmap of likely interaction areas (derived from behavioral model).
*   **Metadata Packaging:** Package tiles with associated zoom and interaction metadata.

**II. Client-Side Implementation (Browser Module):**

*   **Initial Preview Display:** Display initial preview tiles as in the base patent.
*   **Predictive Zoom Rendering:** Render preview tiles at assigned predicted zoom levels.
*   **Dynamic Interaction Mapping:**
    *   Implement a virtual canvas *beneath* the visible preview. This canvas represents the full page, even though it isn't fully loaded.
    *   When the user interacts with a preview tile (scroll, tap, zoom), translate the interaction *onto* the virtual canvas. Use the heatmap data to refine interaction mapping (e.g., a tap on a heatmap “hotspot” should translate to a higher-probability link click on the full page).
    *   Capture these virtual interactions and pre-fetch corresponding page elements (e.g., if the user virtually scrolls, fetch the next section of the page).
*   **Seamless Transition:** Upon full page load, seamlessly replace the virtual canvas with the real page content, preserving the user's virtual interactions (e.g., virtual scrolling position).
*   **Feedback Loop:** Send captured virtual interactions back to the server to refine the behavioral model.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Interaction Handling):**

```
function handleInteraction(tile, event) {
  interactionX = event.clientX;
  interactionY = event.clientY;

  // Get predicted interaction details from tile metadata
  predictedZoom = tile.metadata.zoom;
  interactionHeatmap = tile.metadata.heatmap;

  // Translate interaction to virtual canvas coordinates
  virtualX = interactionX * predictedZoom;
  virtualY = interactionY * predictedZoom;

  // Adjust interaction based on heatmap data
  // (e.g., increase probability of link click if interaction
  // falls within a heatmap hotspot)
  interactionType = determineInteractionType(virtualX, virtualY, interactionHeatmap);

  // Pre-fetch corresponding page elements
  prefetchContent(interactionType, virtualX, virtualY);

  // Update virtual canvas (invisible to the user)
  updateVirtualCanvas(virtualX, virtualY, interactionType);
}
```

**III. System Architecture Additions:**

*   **Interaction Data Storage:**  Database for storing aggregated user interaction data.
*   **Behavioral Modeling Engine:** Server-side component for training and deploying the behavioral model.
*   **Content Prefetching Service:** Service for efficiently prefetching page elements based on predicted user interactions.
