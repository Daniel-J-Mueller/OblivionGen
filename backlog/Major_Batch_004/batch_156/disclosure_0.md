## Autonomous Mobile Device – Dynamic Reflective Surface Mapping & Augmented Reality Projection

**Core Concept:** Expand the reflective surface detection beyond static mapping to enable real-time augmented reality (AR) projections *onto* detected reflective surfaces. This moves beyond simply identifying the surface to *utilizing* it as a display.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **AMD Platform:** Existing AMD platform (as outlined in provided patent) – incorporating camera, lighting components, processors, and memory.
*   **Micro-Projector Array:**  A tightly packed array of low-power micro-projectors integrated into the AMD’s chassis.  Resolution: 640x480 per projector. Quantity: 32. Total projected area (combined): approximately 20cm x 20cm (scalable). Beam angle: adjustable, 10-30 degrees.
*   **TOF Sensor (Enhanced):** High-resolution Time of Flight sensor capable of capturing detailed depth maps at a rate of 60Hz. Range: 0.1m - 10m. Accuracy: +/- 1cm.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** 9-axis IMU for precise tracking of AMD orientation and movement. Sampling Rate: 200Hz.
*   **Edge Computing Module:** Dedicated processor for real-time image processing, AR rendering, and projection control.

**2. Software & Algorithms:**

*   **Reflective Surface Detection (Enhanced):**  Utilize existing patent’s core technology – light emission, image capture, reflection confirmation – with added noise filtering & surface normal estimation.
*   **Dynamic Surface Mapping:**  Implement a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm adapted for reflective surfaces.  Focus on tracking surface movement and deformation in real-time. Incorporate IMU data for stabilization.
*   **AR Rendering Engine:** Develop a lightweight AR rendering engine optimized for low-power mobile devices. Support basic 3D models, text overlays, and animated content.
*   **Projection Calibration Module:**  Automated calibration procedure to align projected content with detected reflective surfaces.  Utilize TOF data and camera images to correct for surface irregularities and distortions.
*   **Content Management System:**  User-friendly interface for creating and managing AR content. Support for pre-defined templates and custom content creation.
*   **Interaction Framework:** Gesture recognition and voice control interface for interacting with projected AR content.

*   **Dynamic Signage:** Create adaptive signage that responds to user interaction and environmental changes.
*   **Robotics & Navigation:** Enhance robotic navigation in complex environments by projecting waypoints and guidance onto reflective surfaces.
*   **AR Gaming:** Develop immersive AR games that utilize reflective surfaces as game boards or interactive elements.
*   **Accessibility:** Provide visual cues and information to individuals with visual impairments by projecting onto reflective surfaces.
