## Adaptive Difficulty Commentary Layer

**Concept:** Expand the synchronized commentary system to dynamically adjust the complexity and depth of displayed commentary based on real-time viewer comprehension metrics.

**Specs:**

*   **Comprehension Engine:** Integrate a real-time viewer comprehension engine. This engine analyzes viewer interaction (pauses, rewinds, seeking, chat engagement relating to confusion) and biometrics (via webcam - optional, user-enabled - pupil dilation, facial micro-expressions indicating confusion/engagement).
*   **Commentary Database:** Create a tiered commentary database. Each segment of video has multiple commentary tracks:
    *   **Basic:** Simple descriptive commentary.
    *   **Intermediate:** Explains core concepts.
    *   **Advanced:** Delves into nuanced details and analysis.
*   **Dynamic Layer Switching:** The system dynamically switches between commentary layers based on the Comprehension Engineâ€™s assessment of each viewer. 
    *   If a viewer pauses frequently or shows confusion indicators, the system switches to a simpler commentary track.
    *   If a viewer exhibits high engagement and minimal confusion, the system switches to a more detailed commentary track.
*   **Commentary Authoring Tools:** Develop tools that allow commentary creators to build tiered commentary tracks for each video segment.  This includes a visual editor to link commentary to specific timestamps and areas of the video frame (allowing for object/character-specific commentary).
*   **User Override:** Allow users to manually override the automatic layer selection and choose a commentary level that suits their preference.
*   **Social Commentary Aggregation:** Allow users to submit commentary that is aggregated and displayed. The system will analyze the submitted text for sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) and keyword relevance to the video segment. It can then rank and display commentary based on its perceived helpfulness (determined by upvotes/downvotes from other viewers). 
*   **Pseudocode (Dynamic Layer Selection):**

```pseudocode
function selectCommentaryLayer(viewerID, currentTime):
  comprehensionData = getComprehensionData(viewerID, currentTime)
  confusionLevel = comprehensionData.confusionLevel
  engagementLevel = comprehensionData.engagementLevel

  if confusionLevel > 0.7:
    layer = "Basic"
  else if engagementLevel > 0.8:
    layer = "Advanced"
  else:
    layer = "Intermediate"

  return layer
```

**Integration:** The system integrates with the existing synchronized video playback and commentary delivery mechanism. The dynamically selected commentary layer is overlaid on the video stream along with the chat bubbles as specified in the base patent.
