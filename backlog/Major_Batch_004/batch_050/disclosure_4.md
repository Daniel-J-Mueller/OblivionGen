## Adaptive Soundscape Layering

**Concept:** Extend the soundmark functionality to create dynamic, layered audio experiences *around* the primary audio content, responding not just to soundmarks, but to content *within* the primary audio itself. Think ambient soundscapes that shift and evolve based on narrative context, emotional tone, or even identified objects/characters mentioned in the primary audio.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** "Contextual Audio Engine" (CAE). This analyzes the primary audio stream in real-time.
*   **Analysis Modules:**
    *   *Narrative Context Module:* Uses natural language processing (NLP) to identify key plot points, character interactions, and setting descriptions.
    *   *Emotional Tone Module:* Analyzes vocal inflections, music (if present in the primary audio), and narrative cues to determine the emotional state of the content. (e.g., suspenseful, joyful, melancholic).
    *   *Object/Entity Recognition Module:* Identifies mentions of objects, characters, or locations within the audio using speech-to-text and named entity recognition.
*   **Soundscape Library:** A repository of pre-composed ambient soundscapes categorized by:
    *   *Narrative Context:* (e.g., "forest battle", "peaceful village", "futuristic cityscape")
    *   *Emotional Tone:* (e.g., "suspenseful underscore", "joyful ambiance", "melancholic atmosphere")
    *   *Object/Entity:* (e.g., "rainforest sounds", "city traffic", "spaceship hum")
*   **Sound Mixing & Layering Engine:** This dynamically blends and layers soundscapes from the Soundscape Library based on the output of the Analysis Modules.
*   **Synchronization File:** Expanded beyond simple audio location mapping. This file now maps narrative events, emotional cues, and object mentions to specific timecodes within the primary audio, *and* to corresponding soundscape elements within the Soundscape Library.
*   **User Control:** Options for the user to adjust the intensity and character of the layered soundscapes (e.g., “increase forest ambience”, “subtle emotional underscore”).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (audioStreamAvailable) {

    // 1. Analyze primary audio
    narrativeContext = NarrativeContextModule.analyze(audioStream);
    emotionalTone = EmotionalToneModule.analyze(audioStream);
    objects = ObjectRecognitionModule.analyze(audioStream);

    // 2. Lookup corresponding soundscapes in Soundscape Library
    soundscapes = SoundscapeLibrary.getSoundscapes(narrativeContext, emotionalTone, objects);

    // 3. Mix and layer soundscapes
    layeredSoundscape = SoundMixingEngine.mix(soundscapes);

    // 4. Output combined audio (primary + layered)
    outputAudio = AudioEngine.combine(audioStream, layeredSoundscape);

    // 5. Adjust volume based on user settings
    outputAudio = VolumeControl.adjust(outputAudio, userSettings);

}
```

**Example:**

Imagine an audiobook about a detective investigating a crime in a rainy city.

*   **Primary Audio:** Detective narrates the scene.
*   **Analysis:** NLP identifies “rain”, “city”, “suspenseful”.
*   **Soundscape Library:** Returns “city rain ambience”, “suspenseful underscore”.
*   **Output:** The audiobook is played alongside a realistic rain ambience and a subtle, atmospheric underscore, enhancing the immersive experience.
