## Dynamic Directory Re-Parenting with Predictive Move Rank Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend the move rank system to proactively adjust ranks *before* a move operation is initiated, predicting potential conflicts and resolving them in a distributed, asynchronous manner. This moves away from reactive conflict resolution to a preventative system, optimizing for speed and minimizing locking.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive Rank Analyzer (PRA) Module:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors directory creation and deletion events.  Calculates potential impact on move ranks across the entire file system tree.
*   **Input:**  File system event stream (directory creation, deletion, renaming). Current move rank assignments.
*   **Output:** List of ‘Rank Adjustment Proposals’ (RAPs).

**2. Rank Adjustment Proposal (RAP) Data Structure:**

*   `RAP_ID`: Unique identifier.
*   `Target_Directory`: Directory where a rank adjustment is proposed.
*   `Adjustment_Type`:  `INCREASE`, `DECREASE`, `HOLD`.
*   `Predicted_Impact`: Numerical score representing the potential disruption to other move ranks if the adjustment is *not* applied.  Calculated via a tree traversal algorithm estimating the number of ranks that would need to be adjusted downstream.
*   `Priority`: Calculated based on `Predicted_Impact` and a time-to-impact estimate (how soon the adjustment will be needed to avoid a conflict).
*   `Initiating_Operation`: Identifier of the operation that triggered the RAP (e.g., directory creation, proposed move).

**3. Distributed Rank Adjustment Engine (DRAE):**

*   **Architecture:**  Microservice architecture with individual nodes responsible for a subset of the file system tree. Nodes communicate asynchronously via a message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
*   **Function:**  Receives RAPs from the PRA, evaluates their feasibility, and applies adjustments to move ranks.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Receive RAP:** DRAE node receives a RAP.
    2.  **Conflict Check:**  DRAE node checks for immediate conflicts with existing move rank assignments.  This is a read-only operation.
    3.  **Feasibility Evaluation:**  DRAE node simulates the RAP’s impact on the local subtree using a lightweight, optimistic locking mechanism. If the simulation is successful, the RAP is considered feasible.
    4.  **Distributed Commit:** If feasible, the DRAE node initiates a distributed commit protocol (e.g., two-phase commit) with neighboring DRAE nodes (those responsible for the parent and child directories).
    5.  **Rank Adjustment:**  Upon successful commit, the DRAE node adjusts the move rank of the target directory.
    6.  **Notification:**  DRAE node notifies the PRA that the adjustment is complete.

**4.  Asynchronous Operation:**

*   The PRA and DRAE operate entirely asynchronously.  The PRA does not wait for DRAE to complete adjustments before processing new events.
*   DRAE nodes maintain a queue of pending RAPs, processing them in order of priority.

**Pseudocode (DRAE Node - Process RAP):**

```
function ProcessRAP(RAP):
  if RAP.Adjustment_Type == INCREASE:
    // Check if increasing rank violates parent's rank.
    if ParentRank(RAP.Target_Directory) < CurrentRank(RAP.Target_Directory) + 1:
      // Defer adjustment - request parent rank increase first.
      CreateRAP(Target_Directory = Parent(RAP.Target_Directory), Adjustment_Type = INCREASE)
      return
  // Optimistic Lock - attempt to acquire locks on parent and target.
  if AcquireLocks(Parent(RAP.Target_Directory), RAP.Target_Directory):
    // Simulate rank adjustment.
    SimulateAdjustment(RAP)
    // If simulation successful, initiate distributed commit.
    InitiateDistributedCommit(RAP)
    ReleaseLocks(Parent(RAP.Target_Directory), RAP.Target_Directory)
  else:
    // Lock contention - requeue RAP for later processing.
    RequeueRAP(RAP)
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Locking:** Proactive rank adjustments minimize the need for locking during actual move operations.
*   **Improved Performance:**  Faster move operations due to pre-adjusted ranks.
*   **Scalability:** Distributed architecture enables scaling to handle large file systems.
*   **Resilience:** Asynchronous operation enhances resilience to failures.
