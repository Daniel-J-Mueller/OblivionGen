## Personalized Predictive Assistance with Dynamic Skill Chaining

**Concept:** Expand proactive assistance beyond simple event detection and single-action suggestions. Develop a system that anticipates complex user needs by chaining multiple skills together based on inferred intent and contextual awareness. This moves beyond reacting to events to *proactively orchestrating* solutions.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A "Proactive Orchestration Engine" (POE).
*   **Input:**
    *   User profile data (from the existing system).
    *   Activity data stream (existing).
    *   Real-time sensor data (location, time of day, ambient sound, device usage).
    *   External API access (weather, traffic, news, calendar, shopping).
*   **Knowledge Representation:**
    *   Enhanced Knowledge Graph: Expand the existing knowledge graph to include “Skill Chains” – pre-defined sequences of skills designed to address specific complex needs. These chains are parameterized, allowing for dynamic adjustment based on context.
    *   "Need Profiles": Abstract representations of user needs. Example: “Prepare for Morning Commute”, “Manage Post-Workout Recovery”, “Plan Weekend Getaway”.  These profiles are linked to Skill Chains.
*   **Inference Engine:**
    *   Probabilistic Need Inference: Uses Bayesian networks or similar methods to infer the probability of a user entering a specific Need Profile, based on all available input data.
    *   Contextual Refinement: Adapts Skill Chains in real-time based on the user’s immediate context.  Example: If the “Prepare for Morning Commute” chain is activated, and traffic data indicates a major accident, the chain can dynamically reroute the user and suggest alternative transportation.
*   **Skill Chain Execution:**
    *   Modular Skill Architecture: Skills must be designed as independent, reusable modules with well-defined inputs and outputs.
    *   Dynamic Parameterization: Skill Chains can pass parameters between skills, allowing for fine-grained control and customization.
    *   User Confirmation/Override:  Critical actions require user confirmation. The system should provide clear explanations for its recommendations and allow users to easily override or modify the proposed plan.
*   **Learning & Adaptation:**
    *   Reinforcement Learning: Use reinforcement learning to optimize Skill Chain parameters and selection based on user feedback and success rates.
    *   Skill Discovery:  Implement an algorithm to automatically discover new Skill Chains by analyzing user activity and identifying patterns.

**Pseudocode (POE - Core Logic):**

```
function process_data(user_data, activity_stream, sensor_data, external_api_data):
    # 1. Infer Need Profiles
    need_probabilities = infer_need_profiles(user_data, activity_stream, sensor_data, external_api_data)

    # 2. Select Best Skill Chain
    best_skill_chain = select_best_skill_chain(need_probabilities)

    # 3. Adapt Skill Chain (Contextual Refinement)
    adapted_skill_chain = adapt_skill_chain(best_skill_chain, sensor_data, external_api_data)

    # 4. User Confirmation (if required)
    if adapted_skill_chain.requires_confirmation:
        present_recommendation_to_user()
        user_response = get_user_response()
        if user_response == "accept":
            execute_skill_chain(adapted_skill_chain)
        else:
            # Handle rejection or modification
            pass

    else:
        execute_skill_chain(adapted_skill_chain)
```

**Example Skill Chain:** "Post-Workout Recovery"

1.  Detect Workout End (from activity data).
2.  Recommend Hydration (send notification with water intake suggestion).
3.  Suggest Protein Shake (offer recipe or ordering option).
4.  Play Relaxing Music (based on user preference).
5.  Schedule Stretching Reminder (add to calendar).
