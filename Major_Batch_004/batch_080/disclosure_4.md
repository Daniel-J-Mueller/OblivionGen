## Dynamic Workflow Branching via Sentiment Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the interactive contact workflow system to dynamically alter the workflow path based on real-time sentiment analysis of the user’s audio input. This enables a more personalized and efficient experience, tailoring the interaction based on detected emotional state.

**Specifications:**

*   **Module:** Sentiment Analysis Engine (SAE)
*   **Integration Point:** Between the audio input interface and the workflow execution engine. All audio received from the user is routed through the SAE *before* being processed for command identification.
*   **SAE Functionality:**
    *   Real-time audio processing to detect sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, frustrated, angry, etc.).
    *   Confidence scoring for each sentiment detection.
    *   Threshold settings to determine sensitivity to sentiment changes.
*   **Workflow Adaptation Logic:**
    *   Workflow definition includes “Sentiment Branches”. These are alternative paths triggered by specific sentiment detections and confidence levels.
    *   Example: If the SAE detects “frustration” with >70% confidence, the workflow branches to a “Customer Service Escalation” path, bypassing standard prompts and connecting the user to a live agent.
    *   Alternative Branching: Sentiment could *modify* existing prompts. For example, if a user expresses positive sentiment, the system could offer an up-sell or promotional offer.
*   **GUI Integration:**
    *   Display a visual indicator of the detected sentiment within the GUI (e.g., a color-coded icon – green for positive, red for negative).
    *   Allow operators to manually override the sentiment-based branching for quality control or specific cases.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Inside Workflow Engine

function processUserInput(audioInput) {
  sentiment = SentimentAnalysisEngine.analyze(audioInput)
  confidence = sentiment.confidence

  if (confidence > sentimentThreshold) { // e.g., 0.7
    if (sentiment.value == "frustration") {
      // Branch to Escalation Path
      executeWorkflowPath("Escalation")
    } else if (sentiment.value == "positive") {
      // Modify Next Prompt to Include Promotion
      nextPrompt = modifyPrompt(nextPrompt, "Include promotion X")
      executeNextPrompt(nextPrompt)
    } else {
      // Execute Default Workflow Path
      executeWorkflowPath(defaultPath)
    }
  } else {
    // Execute Default Workflow Path - Low Confidence
    executeWorkflowPath(defaultPath)
  }
}
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Sufficient processing power to run the SAE in real-time (GPU acceleration recommended).
    *   High-quality audio input interface.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Store sentiment data for analysis and improvement of the SAE’s accuracy.
    *   Record workflow paths taken based on sentiment to identify trends and optimize the system.
*   **API:**
    *   Expose an API for integration with third-party sentiment analysis services.
    *   Allow developers to create custom sentiment branches and workflows.
