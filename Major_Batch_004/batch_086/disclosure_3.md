## Dynamic Credential Chains with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Expand on the 'injection' concept by allowing context to be chained, with each injection having an associated temporal decay rate. This creates a dynamic, time-sensitive credential that adapts to changing conditions and reduces risk over time.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `Credential`: Base structure, containing standard authentication data.
*   `ContextInjection`:
    *   `principalID`: ID of the injecting principal.
    *   `contextData`: Arbitrary data payload.
    *   `injectionTimestamp`: Time of injection.
    *   `decayRate`:  A numerical value representing the rate at which the context's weight diminishes over time (e.g., linear, exponential).  Range: 0.0 (no decay) to 1.0 (rapid decay).
    *   `weight`: A calculated value representing the current influence of the context, derived from `injectionTimestamp`, `decayRate` and current time.
*   `CredentialChain`: An ordered list of `ContextInjection` objects associated with a `Credential`.

**2. Workflow:**

*   **Injection:** Any authorized principal can inject `ContextInjection` into a `CredentialChain` associated with a target principalâ€™s `Credential`.
*   **Weight Calculation:** Upon authentication request, calculate the `weight` of each `ContextInjection` in the `CredentialChain`. This calculation uses the `injectionTimestamp`, `decayRate`, and current time. For example:
    *   Linear Decay: `weight = 1.0 - ((currentTime - injectionTimestamp) * decayRate)`
    *   Exponential Decay: `weight = e^(-decayRate * (currentTime - injectionTimestamp))`
    *   Weight capped at 0.0 and 1.0.
*   **Policy Evaluation:**  The authentication policy evaluation engine integrates the weighted context from the `CredentialChain`.  Context with higher weights has a stronger influence on access decisions.
*   **Chain Pruning:** A background process periodically removes `ContextInjection` entries from `CredentialChain` if their `weight` falls below a defined threshold. This prevents stale or irrelevant context from accumulating and affecting performance.

**3. API Endpoints:**

*   `POST /credentials/{principalID}/injectContext`:  Injects a `ContextInjection` into the `CredentialChain`. Requires authentication of the injecting principal and authorization to inject context for the target principal.  Input: `principalID`, `contextData`, `decayRate`.
*   `GET /credentials/{principalID}/contextChain`: Retrieves the current `CredentialChain` for a given principal. Requires authorization.
*   `DELETE /credentials/{principalID}/contextChain/{injectionID}`: Removes a specific `ContextInjection` from the `CredentialChain`. Requires authorization.

**4. Pseudocode (Policy Evaluation):**

```
function evaluatePolicy(credential, resource, action) {
  policy = getPolicy(resource, action)
  context = {}

  for (injection in credential.contextChain) {
    weight = calculateWeight(injection)
    context[injection.contextData.key] = injection.contextData.value * weight
  }

  // Integrate context into policy evaluation rules
  if (policy.rules.some(rule => rule.evaluate(context))) {
    return ALLOWED
  } else {
    return DENIED
  }
}

function calculateWeight(injection) {
  currentTime = getCurrentTime()
  age = currentTime - injection.injectionTimestamp
  weight = 1.0 - (age * injection.decayRate)
  return Math.max(0.0, Math.min(1.0, weight)) // Cap weight between 0 and 1
}
```

**5. Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Dynamic Access Control:** Grant temporary access based on context (e.g., location, device type) that decays over time.
*   **Risk-Based Authentication:** Increase authentication requirements based on the weighted influence of risk factors.
*   **Adaptive Security Policies:** Automatically adjust security policies based on real-time context and risk assessments.
