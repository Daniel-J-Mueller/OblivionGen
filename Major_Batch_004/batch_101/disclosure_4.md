## Dynamic Workspace Partitioning with Projected Augmented Reality

**Concept:** Expand the short-range transmission system to dynamically define and project augmented reality (AR) “soft barriers” within the workspace, creating temporary, visually-defined zones for both workers and robots. This adds a layer of proactive safety *beyond* evasive maneuvers.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Robot-Mounted Projectors:** Each robot is equipped with multiple (minimum 4, arranged for 360-degree coverage) low-power, short-throw AR projectors. These projectors operate in the visible light spectrum.
*   **Worker AR Glasses/Visors:** Workers wear AR glasses or visors capable of displaying projected AR elements. These must include depth sensors to differentiate projected AR from real-world objects.
*   **Central Control with Workspace Mapping:** The central control maintains a dynamic, high-resolution 3D map of the warehouse space, including static obstacles and the current positions of all robots and workers.
*   **Enhanced Short-Range Transmission Network:**  The existing RFID/short-range transmission system is expanded to include directional antennas. This allows the central control to determine the *direction* from which a signal is received, improving positioning accuracy.

**2. Software/Algorithm Components:**

*   **Zone Definition Module:** The central control can define virtual zones of varying sizes and shapes (e.g., circular, rectangular, custom polygons). These zones are associated with workers.
*   **Dynamic Zone Projection Algorithm:** When a worker enters the workspace (detected via the short-range transmission network), the central control calculates the optimal projection parameters (size, shape, color, opacity) for a virtual zone *around* the worker. This calculation considers the worker's speed and direction of travel, as well as the predicted paths of nearby robots.  The zone is then projected onto the floor and surrounding surfaces by the robot projectors.
*   **Layered Safety Zones:** Implement three concentric zones:
    *   **Inner Zone (Red):**  Direct proximity – robots *must* stop.  Projected as a solid red barrier.
    *   **Intermediate Zone (Yellow):**  Caution – robots reduce speed by 50%. Projected as a pulsing yellow barrier.
    *   **Outer Zone (Green):** Awareness – robots reduce speed by 25%. Projected as a static green guideline.
*   **Robot Perception Integration:**  Robot vision systems are trained to recognize the projected AR barriers.  These barriers are treated as temporary obstacles for path planning.
*   **Worker AR Display Integration:** Worker AR glasses display an overlay of the projected zones, highlighting the safety boundaries. The system indicates to workers when a robot is approaching a zone.
*   **Conflict Resolution:**  If a robot's predicted path intersects a worker's projected zone, the central control automatically adjusts the robot's route *before* evasive maneuvers are necessary.  The system prioritizes worker safety.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  A worker enters the warehouse and is identified by the short-range transmission network.
2.  The central control creates a dynamic virtual zone around the worker.
3.  Robot projectors project the virtual zone onto the warehouse floor.
4.  Robot vision systems and the central control use the projected zone to update robot path planning.
5.  Worker AR glasses display the projected zones and provide visual warnings of approaching robots.
6.  As the worker moves, the virtual zone dynamically adjusts to maintain a safe perimeter.
7.  When the worker leaves the workspace, the virtual zone is automatically deactivated.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Robot Path Planning):**

```
function update_path(robot, current_path, obstacles, projected_zones):
  // Check for collisions with static obstacles
  if (collision with obstacle):
    replan_path()
  
  // Check for intersections with projected zones
  for each zone in projected_zones:
    if (predicted_path intersects zone):
      // Adjust path to avoid zone
      new_path = adjust_path(current_path, zone)
      return new_path

  // If no conflicts, follow the original path
  return current_path
```
