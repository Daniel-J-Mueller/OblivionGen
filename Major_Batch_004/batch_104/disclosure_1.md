## Adaptive Multi-Radio Beaconing & Contextual Handover

**Specification:** A system for intelligently switching between radio technologies (beyond just EV-DO/1xRTT) based not only on signal strength and data rates, but also *predicted* user context derived from sensor data and learned behavior.  The system aims to preemptively switch radios *before* a connection is lost, maximizing uptime and user experience.

**Core Components:**

*   **Sensor Fusion Module:** Collects data from onboard sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, microphone, ambient light, etc.). Processes this data to infer user activity (walking, driving, stationary, in a meeting, etc.) and environment (indoors, outdoors, vehicle, public transport).
*   **Behavioral Learning Engine:**  Uses machine learning (specifically, recurrent neural networks) to build a user profile based on historical sensor data and radio technology usage.  Learns patterns like "User typically switches to Wi-Fi at 8 AM at location X" or "User always loses EV-DO signal when passing through location Y."
*   **Predictive Radio Manager:**  Combines real-time sensor data, the learned user profile, and radio signal characteristics to *predict* connection quality for each available radio technology (e.g., 5G, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth, LoRaWAN, etc.). It then proactively switches the user device to the most suitable radio technology *before* a handover is forced.
*   **Beaconing Protocol Enhancement:** The device transmits customized 'context beacons' detailing its predicted activity and preferred radio technology. This allows network infrastructure to proactively allocate resources and optimize handover procedures.
*   **Multi-Radio Coexistence Manager:** A module designed to manage multiple active radios simultaneously for specific tasks, like streaming high-bandwidth content while maintaining a low-power connection for background tasks.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Radio Manager):**

```
FUNCTION predict_radio_technology(sensor_data, user_profile, radio_characteristics):
  // Calculate a 'suitability score' for each radio technology
  FOR each radio_technology IN available_radio_technologies:
    suitability_score = 0

    // Score based on real-time sensor data
    IF sensor_data.activity == "driving":
      suitability_score += radio_technology.mobility_score * 0.5
    ELSE IF sensor_data.activity == "stationary":
      suitability_score += radio_technology.low_power_score * 0.3
    // ... other activity-based scores

    // Score based on learned user profile
    IF user_profile.preferred_radio == radio_technology:
      suitability_score += 0.2

    // Score based on radio characteristics
    suitability_score += radio_technology.signal_strength * 0.2
    suitability_score += radio_technology.data_rate * 0.3

    radio_scores[radio_technology] = suitability_score

  // Select the radio technology with the highest score
  best_radio = max(radio_scores, key=radio_scores.get)

  RETURN best_radio
```
