**Dynamic Content Stitching with Predictive Pre-Fetch based on User Gaze Tracking**

**Concept:** Extend the real-time feedback loop beyond decoding metrics to incorporate user gaze tracking data. This allows for predictive pre-fetching and dynamic content stitching, significantly reducing buffering and improving perceived quality, *especially* for immersive content like VR/AR or high-resolution live streams.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Gaze Tracking Integration:**
    *   Client-side SDK integrated with compatible gaze tracking hardware/software (VR headsets, eye trackers, even webcam-based gaze estimation).
    *   SDK collects gaze direction (x, y coordinates within the viewport) and dwell time (duration gaze remains fixed on a region).
    *   Data transmitted as part of real-time player metrics to the controller. Bandwidth optimization is critical – prioritize essential gaze data.

2.  **Predictive Region Identification:**
    *   Controller analyzes gaze data to identify regions of interest (ROIs) *within* the video frame.  ROIs represent areas the user is most likely to view next.
    *   Utilize machine learning (specifically, recurrent neural networks - RNNs) to predict gaze movement.  Train the model on aggregated gaze data from many users.
    *   Divide the video frame into a tile-based system.  Each tile becomes a candidate ROI.

3.  **Dynamic Content Stitching:**
    *   Video content is pre-encoded into multiple resolutions/qualities *and* broken into small, seamless segments (e.g., 0.5-1 second chunks).
    *   Based on predicted ROIs, the controller requests (or pre-fetches) higher-quality segments for those specific areas.
    *   The client stitches together segments of varying quality. The ROI receives the high-quality segment, while peripheral regions receive lower-quality segments.  This creates a ‘foveated rendering’ effect.

4.  **Pre-Fetch & Caching:**
    *   Utilize the gaze prediction model to anticipate future ROIs. Pre-fetch corresponding segments and store them in the content cache.
    *   Implement a caching strategy that prioritizes segments likely to be viewed soon, based on gaze prediction confidence.
    *   Adaptive pre-fetching: Adjust pre-fetch aggressiveness based on network conditions and prediction accuracy.

5.  **Controller Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
function processRealTimeMetrics(metrics) {
  gazeData = metrics.gazeData;
  if (gazeData != null) {
    predictedROIs = predictROIs(gazeData); // Using RNN model
    requestHighQualitySegments(predictedROIs);
    updateCachePriorities(predictedROIs);
  }
}

function predictROIs(gazeData) {
  // Input: Gaze coordinates, dwell time
  // Output: List of tiles representing predicted ROIs
  // Utilize RNN model to predict future gaze positions
  // Convert predicted positions to corresponding video tiles
  return predictedTiles;
}

function requestHighQualitySegments(tiles) {
  // Request high-quality segments for specified tiles
  // From content delivery network (CDN) or cache
}

function updateCachePriorities(tiles) {
  // Increase priority of segments corresponding to predicted ROIs
  // In content cache
}
```

6. **Encoding Considerations:**
    *   Employ scalable video coding (SVC) or multi-view video coding (MVC) to facilitate dynamic quality switching.
    *   Content aware encoding; prioritize quality for areas likely to be viewed.

7.  **Client-Side Rendering:**
    *   Seamless stitching of segments, minimizing visual artifacts.
    *   Real-time composition of varying quality segments.
    *   Rendering pipeline optimized for foveated rendering.
