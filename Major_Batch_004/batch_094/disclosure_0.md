## Secure Function Chaining with Dynamic Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the host class and secure identifier system to facilitate chained secure functions where trust isn't static, but dynamically assessed *during* the chain. This allows for complex operations requiring multiple security layers, adapting to real-time threat levels or system integrity.

**Specifications:**

**1.  Trust Score Component:**

    *   Each host computer maintains a ‘Trust Score’—a numerical representation of its current security posture. This is derived from multiple factors:
        *   System integrity checks (bootloader, OS files).
        *   Real-time threat detection (antivirus, intrusion detection).
        *   Network reputation (IP address blacklists, peer trust).
        *   Hardware attestation (Trusted Platform Module data).
    *   Trust Score is periodically updated and accessible via a secure API.

**2.  Secure Function Definition & Dependency Mapping:**

    *   Secure Functions are defined with explicit dependencies on other functions *and* a minimum acceptable Trust Score for dependent hosts.  
    *   Dependency mapping is stored centrally (similar to a host class access control list, but more granular).
    *   Example: ‘DecryptContent’ depends on ‘AuthenticateUser’ (minimum Trust Score 75) and ‘VerifyDataIntegrity’ (minimum Trust Score 80).

**3.  Chained Function Execution Flow:**

    1.  A request initiates a chain of Secure Functions.
    2.  For each function in the chain:
        *   The system retrieves the requesting host’s Trust Score.
        *   If the Trust Score meets the minimum requirement for all dependencies, the function executes.
        *   If the Trust Score is insufficient:
            *   The function is skipped.
            *   An alternative, lower-security function can be executed (if defined).
            *   The entire chain can be aborted.
            *   A notification is triggered (security event).
    3.  Function results are securely passed down the chain.

**4.  Dynamic Trust Threshold Adjustment:**

    *   A centralized ‘Security Policy Engine’ dynamically adjusts Trust Score thresholds based on:
        *   Global threat intelligence feeds.
        *   System-specific risk profiles.
        *   Time of day/operational context.
    *   The Security Policy Engine pushes updated thresholds to all hosts.

**5.  Pseudocode (Function Chain Execution):**

```
function executeFunctionChain(request, functionList):
  for function in functionList:
    hostTrustScore = getHostTrustScore(request.host)
    dependenciesMet = true
    for dependency in function.dependencies:
      if hostTrustScore < dependency.minTrustScore:
        dependenciesMet = false
        // Optional: Execute alternative function
        // alternativeFunction = getAlternativeFunction(dependency)
        // if alternativeFunction != null:
        //   executeFunction(alternativeFunction, request)
        break

    if dependenciesMet:
      executeFunction(function, request)
    else:
      logSecurityEvent("Trust Score insufficient for " + function.name)
      // Optional: Abort chain
      break
  return response
```

**6.  Data Structures:**

    *   `SecureFunction`:  `name`, `dependencies` (list of `Dependency`), `executionCode`
    *   `Dependency`: `functionName`, `minTrustScore`
    *   `HostTrustScore`: `hostID`, `trustScore`, `lastUpdated`

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Secure API for Trust Score access.
*   Centralized Security Policy Engine.
*   Robust logging and auditing.
*   Scalability to handle a large number of hosts and functions.
*   Consider hardware-based security for Trust Score attestation.
