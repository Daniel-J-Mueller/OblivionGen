## Dynamic Sensor Fusion & Predictive Vulnerability Scoring

**Concept:** Expand beyond static assessment data objects to a system that *predicts* vulnerabilities based on dynamic sensor fusion and behavioral analysis, using a continuously updating “security posture score”.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Module: Behavioral Sensor Network (BSN)**

*   **Purpose:** Collects real-time behavioral data from the target computing resource *beyond* traditional telemetry & configuration.  Focuses on process interactions, network communication patterns, and resource access sequences.
*   **Sensor Types:**
    *   *Process Interaction Monitor (PIM):* Tracks inter-process communication (IPC) – which processes talk to each other, what data is exchanged.  Captures API calls, shared memory access, and message queue interactions.
    *   *Network Behavior Analyzer (NBA):* Monitors network traffic *at the application layer* – analyzing protocols, data payloads (where permissible), and connection frequencies.  Identifies anomalous network activity.
    *   *Resource Access Auditor (RAA):* Logs access to critical system resources (files, registry keys, memory regions) – noting *who* accessed *what* and *when*.
*   **Data Format:**  Time-series data with contextual metadata (process ID, user ID, resource name, etc.).  Stored in a high-throughput, scalable time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus).

**2. Data Fusion Engine (DFE)**

*   **Purpose:** Combines data from the BSN sensors into a unified stream of behavioral data.  Resolves ambiguities and identifies correlations.
*   **Techniques:**
    *   *Event Correlation:*  Identifies sequences of events that indicate malicious activity (e.g., a process launching a shell, followed by network communication to an external IP).
    *   *Anomaly Detection:*  Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forests) to identify deviations from normal behavior.  Requires a training phase to establish a baseline of normal activity.
    *   *Behavioral Profiling:*  Creates profiles of individual processes and users based on their historical behavior.  Detects deviations from these profiles.
*   **Output:** A continuously updated stream of “behavioral events” with associated confidence scores.

**3. Security Posture Score (SPS) Module**

*   **Purpose:**  Calculates a dynamic “Security Posture Score” (SPS) for the target computing resource based on the output of the DFE.
*   **Scoring Algorithm:**
    *   *Weighted Sum:*  Assigns weights to different types of behavioral events based on their severity and likelihood of indicating malicious activity.
    *   *Temporal Decay:*  Decreases the weight of older events over time, reflecting the fact that past behavior is less indicative of current risk.
    *   *Contextual Factors:*  Adjusts the score based on the criticality of the resources being accessed and the sensitivity of the data being processed.
*   **Output:**  A numerical SPS value ranging from 0 to 100, where higher values indicate a more secure posture.

**4. Predictive Vulnerability Assessment (PVA) Module**

*   **Purpose:** Uses the SPS and behavioral data to predict potential vulnerabilities *before* they can be exploited.
*   **Techniques:**
    *   *Threat Modeling:*  Identifies potential attack vectors based on the system’s configuration and known vulnerabilities.
    *   *Behavioral Analysis:*  Analyzes behavioral data to identify patterns that suggest an attacker is probing the system.
    *   *Machine Learning:*  Trains a model to predict the likelihood of a successful attack based on the SPS and behavioral data.
*   **Output:**  A prioritized list of potential vulnerabilities with associated risk scores and mitigation recommendations.

**5. Integration with Existing Assessment System**

*   The PVA module will integrate with the existing security assessment system by providing a dynamic feed of vulnerability predictions and risk scores.
*   The existing rules packages can be updated to take into account the SPS and behavioral data, allowing for more targeted and effective assessments.
*   The system will use the existing ingestion function to convert the behavioral data into assessment data objects, ensuring compatibility with the existing infrastructure.

**Pseudocode (PVA Module):**

```pseudocode
function predictVulnerabilities(behavioralData, SPS):
  threatModel = loadThreatModel()
  predictedVulnerabilities = []

  for each potentialAttackVector in threatModel:
    riskScore = calculateRiskScore(potentialAttackVector, behavioralData, SPS)
    if riskScore > threshold:
      predictedVulnerabilities.append(potentialAttackVector)

  return predictedVulnerabilities
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static assessment to dynamic, predictive vulnerability assessment.  By fusing data from multiple sensors and using machine learning to identify patterns, it can anticipate attacks before they happen. This goes beyond the original patent's focus on *evaluating* security characteristics to *predicting* them.  The Security Posture Score provides a continuous measure of risk that can be used to prioritize remediation efforts.
