## Dynamic Network ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Expand the threshold-based routing deprioritization to incorporate ‘shadowing’ – proactively replicating critical connection states to alternative routers *before* thresholds are hit – and combine this with predictive load balancing based on historical traffic patterns and real-time anomaly detection.

**Specs:**

*   **Shadow Router Selection:** For each router in the first stage, designate 2-3 ‘shadow’ routers in the same stage. Shadow router selection prioritizes physical proximity (minimizing latency) and available capacity.
*   **State Replication Protocol:** Develop a lightweight protocol for continuously replicating key connection state information (source/destination IPs, port numbers, established flags, recent throughput) to shadow routers.  This must be near real-time (sub-100ms latency for state update) to ensure seamless failover.  Consider using a delta-encoding scheme to minimize bandwidth overhead.
*   **Threshold Prediction Engine:** Implement a machine learning model trained on historical traffic data to *predict* when a router’s available connections are likely to fall below a threshold. This prediction should occur several seconds to minutes *before* the actual threshold is reached. Utilize time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) with input features including:
    *   Current connection count
    *   Connection rate (new connections per second)
    *   Average connection duration
    *   Time of day/day of week
    *   External factors (e.g., known events that might affect network traffic)
*   **Proactive Traffic Shifting:** When the prediction engine indicates an impending threshold breach, *proactively* begin shifting new traffic to the designated shadow routers. Implement a gradual ramp-up of traffic shifting to avoid abrupt disruptions.
*   **Health Monitoring & Shadow Router Validation:** Continuously monitor the health of shadow routers. Verify that they can successfully handle redirected traffic. If a shadow router becomes unavailable, dynamically select a new shadow router.
*   **Anomaly Detection Integration:** Integrate with a real-time anomaly detection system. If an unexpected surge in traffic is detected, *immediately* begin shifting traffic to shadow routers *regardless* of threshold predictions.
*   **Control Plane Communication:** Utilize a distributed control plane (e.g., using a gossip protocol) to disseminate threshold predictions, shadow router assignments, and traffic shifting instructions.
*   **Test Message Enhancement**: Instead of simple connectivity tests, integrate a 'synthetic load' test that mimics realistic traffic patterns to more accurately assess available capacity.

**Pseudocode (Traffic Shifting Logic - executed on a router in the third stage):**

```
// Variables:
router_id = current router's ID
first_stage_router_id = ID of the first-stage router being monitored
shadow_router_list = list of shadow routers for first_stage_router_id
predicted_threshold_breach = boolean (true if a breach is predicted)
anomalous_traffic_detected = boolean (true if anomalous traffic is detected)
current_traffic_percentage_to_first_stage_router = current percentage of traffic sent to first_stage_router

function shiftTraffic(router_id, first_stage_router_id, shadow_router_list, predicted_threshold_breach, anomalous_traffic_detected):

  if predicted_threshold_breach or anomalous_traffic_detected:

    // Calculate traffic shifting percentage based on severity of prediction/anomaly
    traffic_shift_percentage = min(50%, max(10%, (prediction_severity + anomaly_severity) * 10))

    // Distribute traffic shifting percentage across shadow routers
    shadow_router_traffic_percentage = traffic_shift_percentage / length(shadow_router_list)

    // Update routing tables to redirect traffic to shadow routers
    for each shadow_router in shadow_router_list:
      updateRoutingTable(shadow_router, shadow_router_traffic_percentage)

    // Reduce traffic percentage to first stage router
    current_traffic_percentage_to_first_stage_router -= traffic_shift_percentage

  else:
    //Gradually restore traffic to first stage router if conditions improve
    if current_traffic_percentage_to_first_stage_router < 100%:
      current_traffic_percentage_to_first_stage_router += 1% #Increase by 1% each cycle
```

**Potential Benefits:** Dramatically improve network resilience, minimize disruption during congestion events, and provide a more proactive approach to load balancing.
