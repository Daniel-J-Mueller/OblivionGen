## Automated Patch Canarying with Predictive Failure Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the existing patch approval system to include a tiered, automated "canary" deployment strategy *before* broad rollout, coupled with predictive failure analysis using machine learning. This moves beyond simple approval/denial to active, data-driven risk mitigation.

**Specs:**

1.  **Canary Group Definition:** User interface element allowing account holders to define "canary groups" – subsets of their VMs.  These groups are specified by tags, instance types, regions, or custom criteria.  A default "critical systems" canary group is pre-configured, tagging VMs identified as core infrastructure.
2.  **Automated Canary Deployment Trigger:** Following user approval of a patch (or a scheduled deployment), the system automatically deploys the patch to the defined canary groups *before* wider deployment.  Deployment is staggered -  a small percentage of VMs within the canary group receive the patch first, increasing over time if no issues are detected.
3.  **Real-Time Performance Monitoring:**  Integrate with existing VM monitoring tools (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network latency). Extend this to monitor *application-level* metrics – response times, error rates, transaction success rates. Key metrics are baselined *before* patch deployment.
4.  **Anomaly Detection Engine:** Implement a machine learning model (e.g., time series forecasting with LSTM networks) trained on historical performance data. The model predicts expected performance *after* patch deployment.  Significant deviations from the prediction trigger alerts.  Alert thresholds are user-configurable.
5.  **Predictive Failure Analysis:**  Beyond simple anomaly detection, use the ML model to *predict* potential failures. The model analyzes performance data and identifies patterns that correlate with past failures. For instance, a specific combination of CPU usage, memory pressure, and network latency might predict an application crash.  The system flags these predictive failures *before* they occur.
6.  **Automated Rollback:** If anomalies or predictive failures are detected, the system automatically rolls back the patch on the affected VMs. Rollback is prioritized –  critical VMs are rolled back first. User-configurable rollback policies determine the extent of the rollback.
7.  **Feedback Loop & Model Retraining:**  Collect data from canary deployments – successful deployments, rollbacks, performance metrics.  Use this data to retrain the ML model, improving its accuracy and reducing false positives. Model retraining is automated and scheduled.
8.  **User Interface – Canary Dashboard:** A dedicated dashboard provides real-time visibility into canary deployments. Key metrics include:
    *   Patch deployment progress (percentage of VMs patched).
    *   Canary group health (overall status – green, yellow, red).
    *   Anomaly scores (severity of detected anomalies).
    *   Predictive failure risk (probability of failure).
    *   Rollback status (number of VMs rolled back).
9. **Integration with Existing Approval Rules:** The system respects existing user-defined approval rules.  For example, a user might have a rule that automatically approves critical security patches.  The canary deployment system adds a layer of validation *on top* of these rules.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
FUNCTION DetectAnomaly(metrics, model):
    predicted_metrics = model.predict(metrics)
    error = calculate_error(metrics, predicted_metrics)
    IF error > threshold:
        RETURN TRUE // Anomaly detected
    ELSE:
        RETURN FALSE // No anomaly detected
```

```
FUNCTION CalculateError(actual, predicted):
    //Calculate RMSE or other error metric
    error = RMSE(actual, predicted)
    RETURN error
```
