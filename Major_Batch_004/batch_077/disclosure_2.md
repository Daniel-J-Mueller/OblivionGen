**Persistent Contextual Data Mirroring for Program Resilience**

**Concept:** Expand on the idea of seamlessly switching to a new program instance upon failure by *proactively* mirroring data context across multiple active program instances. This isn't simple replication, but a nuanced mirroring focused on operational state, allowing for near-instantaneous takeover.

**Specs:**

*   **Component: Context Mirroring Agent (CMA)**: A lightweight agent running alongside each program instance. The CMA's primary function is to observe and capture contextual data.
*   **Contextual Data Definition:** Define a schema for contextual data. This includes:
    *   Active memory regions (code & data) – focusing on *modified* sections.
    *   Open file descriptors and network connections.
    *   Registered signal handlers.
    *   Program counter and stack trace.
    *   Critical internal data structures (identified via a configuration file – allowing customization).
*   **Mirroring Protocol:** Implement a low-latency, asynchronous mirroring protocol.
    *   Utilize a publish-subscribe model. The primary instance *publishes* contextual updates.  Secondary instances *subscribe* and maintain a mirrored copy.
    *   Differential mirroring: Only transmit *changes* to the context, minimizing bandwidth.
    *   Checksumming/hashing for data integrity.
*   **Failure Detection:** Robust failure detection mechanisms.
    *   Heartbeats: Each instance sends periodic heartbeats.
    *   Health checks: The program execution service can perform application-specific health checks.
*   **Switchover Mechanism:**
    *   Upon failure detection, the service selects a mirrored instance.
    *   The selected instance *assumes* the role of the primary.
    *   The service redirects all incoming requests to the new primary.
    *   The failed instance is gracefully terminated or restarted.
*   **API Integration:** Extend the program execution service API to include:
    *   `create_mirrored_instance(program_id, config_file)`: Creates a mirrored instance of a program.
    *   `get_instance_status(instance_id)`: Returns the status of an instance (running, failed, mirrored).
    *    `force_switchover(instance_id)`: Initiates a manual switchover.

**Pseudocode (Switchover Process):**

```
function handle_instance_failure(failed_instance_id):
  mirrored_instances = get_mirrored_instances(failed_instance_id)
  if mirrored_instances is empty:
    // Handle unrecoverable failure (e.g., restart program)
    return

  // Select best mirrored instance (based on load, latency, etc.)
  selected_instance = select_best_instance(mirrored_instances)

  // Redirect traffic to selected instance
  redirect_traffic(selected_instance)

  // Update instance status
  update_instance_status(selected_instance, "primary")
  update_instance_status(failed_instance_id, "failed")

  // Gracefully terminate failed instance
  terminate_instance(failed_instance_id)

  log("Switchover completed to instance: " + selected_instance)
```

**Innovation:** This differs from simple failover by maintaining a *live*, actively updated mirror of the program's context.  This allows for near-instantaneous switchover, minimizing downtime and data loss. The selective mirroring focuses on operational state, reducing overhead compared to full replication.  Configuration files allow tailoring the mirroring process to specific applications.
