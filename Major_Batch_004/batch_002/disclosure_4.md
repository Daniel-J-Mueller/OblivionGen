## Personalized Resource Prioritization via Affective State

**System Overview:**

The core innovation is dynamically adjusting resource weighting (as described in the provided patent) *not* just based on user profiles, but on inferred affective state detected in real-time from multimodal input. This allows the system to tailor responses based on *how* a user is feeling, not just *who* they are.

**Input Modalities:**

1.  **Audio Analysis:** Real-time analysis of speech prosody (pitch, rhythm, intonation) to detect emotional cues (e.g., happiness, frustration, sadness).
2.  **Visual Analysis (Optional):** If the device has a camera, analyze facial expressions and body language for corroborating emotional cues.
3.  **Physiological Data (Optional):** Integration with wearable sensors (heart rate, skin conductance) for more objective emotional state assessment.
4.  **Contextual Data:** Time of day, location, recent interactions – contribute to a broader understanding of the user’s state.

**Affective State Inference Engine:**

1.  **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from each input modality (e.g., pitch variance, facial action units, heart rate variability).
2.  **Sensor Fusion:** Combine features from multiple modalities using a weighted averaging or machine learning model (e.g., Bayesian network, Support Vector Machine).
3.  **State Classification:** Classify the user's affective state into predefined categories (e.g., Happy, Neutral, Frustrated, Sad, Anxious).  Confidence scores should be associated with each classification.
4.  **State Representation:** Represent the affective state as a vector of probabilities (e.g., [Happy: 0.8, Neutral: 0.1, Frustrated: 0.1]).

**Dynamic Resource Weighting Adaptation:**

1.  **Affect-Resource Mapping:** Define a mapping between affective states and resource weight adjustments.  This could be a rule-based system or a learned model.  Example:
    *   If “Frustrated” > 0.7, increase the weight of “Helpful Information” resources and decrease the weight of “Entertainment” resources.
    *   If “Happy” > 0.7, increase the weight of “Entertainment” and “Social” resources.
    *   If “Sad” > 0.7, increase the weight of "Comforting Content" and "Support" resources.
2.  **Weight Adjustment:**  Modify the existing resource weights based on the affect-resource mapping and the current affective state vector.  This can be a linear or non-linear scaling of the weights.
3.  **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously refine the affect-resource mapping based on user feedback and interaction patterns.  For example, if a user consistently rejects suggestions from a particular resource category when in a certain emotional state, decrease the weight of that category for that state.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```
// Global Variables
resource_weights = { "songs": 0.5, "contacts": 0.3, "news": 0.2 } // Initial weights
affect_resource_map = { // Example map
    "happy": { "songs": 0.8, "contacts": 0.6, "news": 0.1 },
    "sad": { "songs": 0.2, "contacts": 0.7, "news": 0.3 },
    "frustrated": { "songs": 0.1, "contacts": 0.5, "news": 0.6 }
}

function process_user_input(user_input, audio_data, visual_data):
    // 1. Infer Affective State
    affective_state = infer_affective_state(audio_data, visual_data) // Returns a vector (e.g., [Happy: 0.6, Neutral: 0.3, Frustrated: 0.1])

    // 2. Determine Dominant Affect
    dominant_affect = get_dominant_affect(affective_state) // e.g., "Happy", "Sad", "Frustrated"

    // 3. Adjust Resource Weights
    if dominant_affect in affect_resource_map:
        new_weights = affect_resource_map[dominant_affect]
        // Normalize weights (ensure sum to 1)
        total = sum(new_weights.values())
        for resource in new_weights:
            new_weights[resource] /= total

        // Apply new weights (can blend with existing weights)
        for resource in resource_weights:
            resource_weights[resource] = (0.7 * resource_weights[resource]) + (0.3 * new_weights.get(resource, 0))

    // 4. Proceed with ASR, NLU, Entity Resolution using updated resource_weights
    // ... (Rest of the processing pipeline)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased processing power to handle real-time audio and visual analysis.
*   Optional camera for visual analysis.
*   Integration with wearable sensors (Bluetooth/WiFi).

**Future Enhancements:**

*   Personalized affective state models (learn each user's unique emotional expressions).
*   Proactive intervention (e.g., suggest relaxing music if the user is detected to be stressed).
*   Multimodal feedback (e.g., adjust device lighting based on user's mood).
