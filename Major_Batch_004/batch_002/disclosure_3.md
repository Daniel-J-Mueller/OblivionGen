## Dynamic Item Profile Scanning & Adaptive Singulation

**Concept:** Augment the singulation system with real-time item profile scanning to dynamically adjust the retaining ledge height *during* item conveyance. This allows for handling a wider range of item sizes and densities *without* mechanical adjustment, increasing throughput and reducing potential jams.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Scanning Array:** Integrate a 3D scanning array (e.g., Time-of-Flight or structured light) positioned *before* the initial portion of the singulation conveyor. This array generates a precise height/width/depth profile for each item entering the system. Multiple scanners may be required to cover the full width of the conveyor.

2.  **Real-Time Profile Analysis:** Implement a processing unit (FPGA or dedicated processor) to analyze the scanned profile data in real-time. The analysis determines the maximum height of the item, and also estimates its density/center of gravity.

3.  **Segmented Retaining Ledge:** Replace the fixed-height retaining ledge with a *segmented* ledge comprised of individually controlled actuators.  Each segment should be approximately 5-10cm in length.  Actuators may be pneumatic, electromechanical (linear actuators), or utilize shape memory alloys. 

4.  **Control Algorithm:** Develop a control algorithm that maps the scanned item height to the appropriate actuator positions.
    *   The algorithm should prioritize maintaining a minimum clearance between the top of the item and the ledge.
    *   Algorithm must account for item density to prevent tipping.
    *   The control algorithm must implement a smoothing function to minimize abrupt ledge height changes and prevent item disruption.

5.  **Conveyor Speed Modulation:** Integrate the control system with the conveyor speed. Increase conveyor speed for items with a lower profile. Decrease conveyor speed for items with a higher profile.

6.  **Emergency Override:** Implement a physical override system to lower all ledge segments in case of system failure or detection of an excessively large/unstable item.

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION adjustLedgeHeight(itemProfile)
  itemHeight = itemProfile.height
  itemDensity = itemProfile.density

  // Define minimum and maximum ledge height limits
  minLedgeHeight = 2cm 
  maxLedgeHeight = 30cm

  // Calculate target ledge height based on item height + safety margin
  targetLedgeHeight = itemHeight + 2cm

  // Clamp target ledge height within defined limits
  IF targetLedgeHeight > maxLedgeHeight THEN
    targetLedgeHeight = maxLedgeHeight
  ENDIF

  IF targetLedgeHeight < minLedgeHeight THEN
    targetLedgeHeight = minLedgeHeight
  ENDIF

  // Adjust ledge height for density (increase height for unstable items)
  IF itemDensity < 0.5 THEN 
    targetLedgeHeight = targetLedgeHeight + 1cm
  ENDIF

  // Send commands to actuators to adjust ledge height segments
  FOR EACH segment IN ledgeSegments
    segment.setHeight(targetLedgeHeight)
  ENDFOR

  RETURN success
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Utilize a machine learning model to predict item dimensions and density based on visual data (from a camera) or weight measurements. This could improve accuracy and reduce reliance on the scanning array.
*   **Multi-Level Singulation:** Implement multiple singulation conveyors operating at different heights to further increase throughput.
*   **Automated Calibration:** Develop a self-calibration routine to ensure the scanning array and actuators are properly aligned and functioning.
