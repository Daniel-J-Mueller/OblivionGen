## Adaptive Predictive Pre-Caching with User Attention Modeling

**Concept:** Expand pre-fetching beyond video to *all* asset types, and dynamically adjust pre-cache priority based on real-time user attention modeling. This isn’t just about predicting *what* a user will click, but *how* they are looking at the page – where their gaze is, how long they dwell on specific elements, and even subtle indicators of intent (like micro-movements).

**Specification:**

**1. Attention Tracking Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time video feed of user's screen (with consent, obviously – privacy is paramount). Mouse tracking, scrolling speed, and potentially even eye-tracking data (if available via webcam).
*   **Processing:**  Utilize a lightweight AI model (Convolutional Neural Network preferred) to analyze the video feed and identify:
    *   **Regions of Interest (ROI):** Areas of the page the user is actively looking at.
    *   **Dwell Time:** How long the user spends looking at each ROI.
    *   **Micro-movements:** Subtle mouse/cursor movements indicating potential intent (e.g., hovering over a "buy" button).
    *   **Scroll Velocity:** Rate of scrolling can indicate urgency or lack of interest.
*   **Output:** A dynamic "Attention Map" overlaid on the rendered webpage.  This map assigns a weight to each element on the page based on the user's attention.

**2. Predictive Asset Pre-Cache Engine:**

*   **Input:**
    *   HTML DOM structure of the webpage.
    *   List of all assets referenced in the DOM (images, videos, 3D models, scripts, CSS, etc.).
    *   Attention Map (from Attention Tracking Module).
    *   User browsing history (optional, with consent).
    *   Global popularity metrics of assets (e.g. based on other user activity).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Asset Prioritization:**  Assign a priority score to each asset based on:
        *   **Attention Weight:**  Assets within or directly related to ROI receive a higher weight.
        *   **Asset Type:**  Heavier assets (e.g., high-resolution videos, 3D models) get higher priority.
        *   **Historical Data:** If a user frequently interacts with specific asset types, prioritize those.
        *   **Popularity Score:**  Globally popular assets get a slight boost.
    *   **Adaptive Pre-Caching:**  Dynamically adjust the pre-cache queue based on the prioritization scores. Higher-priority assets are fetched first.
    *   **Bandwidth Throttling:**  Implement a bandwidth cap to prevent overloading the network. Adjust pre-cache aggressiveness based on network conditions.
*   **Output:** A pre-cached asset pool ready for immediate rendering.

**3. Rendering Pipeline Integration:**

*   When an asset is requested, check if it exists in the pre-cached pool.
*   If found, render immediately.
*   If not found, fetch from the network and add to the pre-cached pool for future use.

**Pseudocode Example (Asset Prioritization):**

```
function calculateAssetPriority(asset) {
  let priority = 0;

  // Attention Weight (0-1)
  if (assetIsInROI(asset)) {
    priority += 0.5;
  }

  // Asset Type Weight
  if (assetIsVideo(asset)) {
    priority += 0.3;
  } else if (assetIsImage(asset)) {
    priority += 0.2;
  }

  // Historical Data (0-1)
  priority += getUserPreferenceScore(assetType);

  // Global Popularity (0-1)
  priority += getGlobalPopularityScore(asset);

  return priority;
}

function assetIsInROI(asset) {
  // Check if the asset's bounding box overlaps with any ROI on the Attention Map
  // Implementation detail: Requires mapping assets to their positions on the webpage
}
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Real-time Attention Modeling:** Goes beyond simple click prediction to understand *how* users are interacting with the page.
*   **Dynamic Prioritization:**  Adjusts pre-cache strategy in real-time based on user behavior.
*   **Multi-Asset Pre-Caching:**  Expands beyond video to improve loading times for all asset types.
*   **Privacy Focus:**  Requires explicit user consent for attention tracking and provides options to disable it.
