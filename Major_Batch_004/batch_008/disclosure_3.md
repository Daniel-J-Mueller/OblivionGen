## Adaptive Wake Word Modulation via Biofeedback

**Core Concept:** Dynamically modify the acoustic characteristics of the wake word based on the user’s real-time physiological state to optimize recognition accuracy and minimize false activations.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Bio-Sensor Array:** Integrated sensors (ECG, GSR, EEG – minimal viable set is ECG & GSR) to capture user's physiological signals. Lightweight, comfortable form factor (earbud integration preferred).
*   **Edge Processing Unit:** Low-power processor embedded within the device to perform real-time signal processing and feature extraction from bio-sensor data.
*   **Acoustic Modulator:** Digital Signal Processing (DSP) component capable of dynamically altering the acoustic properties of the wake word (pitch, timbre, duration, spectral emphasis).
*   **Microphone Array:** Multiple microphones for noise cancellation and improved audio capture.

**II. Software & Algorithms:**

*   **Physiological State Estimation:** Machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) trained to infer user’s cognitive load, emotional state (stress, relaxation), and attention level from bio-sensor data. Input: Raw bio-sensor signals. Output: Estimated cognitive/emotional state (e.g., low/medium/high stress, focused/distracted).
*   **Wake Word Modulation Map:** A lookup table or function that maps estimated physiological states to specific acoustic modifications of the wake word. Examples:
    *   **High Stress/Distraction:** Increase wake word duration, emphasize fundamental frequency, reduce spectral complexity (easier to parse under cognitive load).
    *   **Relaxed/Focused:** Decrease wake word duration, introduce subtle harmonic variations, increase spectral complexity (for nuanced recognition in optimal conditions).
*   **Adaptive Thresholding:** Adjust the sensitivity of the wake word detection algorithm based on the user’s estimated physiological state. Lower threshold during periods of high stress to improve responsiveness, higher threshold during quiet periods to minimize false activations.
*   **Personalized Calibration:** Initial calibration phase to establish a baseline physiological profile and fine-tune the wake word modulation map for each individual user. This could involve the user performing a series of cognitive tasks while physiological data is recorded.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Ongoing learning process to adapt the wake word modulation map and adaptive thresholding parameters based on user feedback and observed performance.

**III. System Workflow:**

1.  **Bio-Signal Acquisition:** Bio-sensors continuously capture user's physiological data.
2.  **Feature Extraction:** Edge processing unit extracts relevant features from the bio-sensor signals (e.g., heart rate variability, skin conductance level).
3.  **State Estimation:** Machine learning model estimates user’s cognitive/emotional state based on the extracted features.
4.  **Acoustic Modulation:**  Based on the estimated state, the acoustic properties of the wake word are dynamically adjusted.
5.  **Wake Word Detection:** Modified wake word is presented for detection by the speech recognition system.
6.  **Adaptive Thresholding:**  Detection threshold is adjusted based on the estimated state.
7.  **Feedback Loop:** System continuously learns and adapts based on user interactions and observed performance.

**Pseudocode (State Estimation):**

```
function estimateState(heartRateVariability, skinConductanceLevel):
  // Define thresholds for classifying states
  highStressThreshold_HRV = 20
  highStressThreshold_GSR = 0.8

  if heartRateVariability < highStressThreshold_HRV and skinConductanceLevel > highStressThreshold_GSR:
    return "High Stress"
  elif heartRateVariability < 40:
    return "Moderate Stress"
  else:
    return "Relaxed"
```

**Pseudocode (Acoustic Modulation):**

```
function modulateWakeWord(wakeWord, state):
  if state == "High Stress":
    durationMultiplier = 1.2
    pitchShift = 0
    complexityReduction = 0.8 // Reduce harmonic richness
  elif state == "Moderate Stress":
    durationMultiplier = 1.1
    pitchShift = 0
    complexityReduction = 0.9
  else:  // Relaxed
    durationMultiplier = 1.0
    pitchShift = 0
    complexityReduction = 1.0

  modifiedWakeWord = applyModifications(wakeWord, durationMultiplier, pitchShift, complexityReduction)
  return modifiedWakeWord
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Hands-free control in high-stress environments (e.g., emergency services, manufacturing).
*   Improved accessibility for users with cognitive impairments.
*   Personalized and adaptive voice assistant experiences.
*   Biometric authentication based on physiological response to wake word.
