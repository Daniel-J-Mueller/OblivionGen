## Dynamic Mood-Based Media Morphing

**Concept:** Extend the trend analysis beyond genre/artist/tempo shifts to *actively* morph media in real-time based on detected user mood, creating a highly personalized and adaptive listening/viewing experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Mood Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time audio analysis of user vocalizations (if available – optional), biometric data from wearable sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial muscle activity – prioritized if available), and historical listening/viewing data.
*   **Processing:** Employ a multi-layered AI model (CNN + LSTM) trained on a large dataset of labeled emotional states (joy, sadness, anger, relaxation, focus, etc.).  The model should output a probability distribution over these emotional states.  Confidence thresholds for each state must be configurable.
*   **Output:**  A current mood state (dominant emotional state) and a confidence level.

**2. Media Decomposition & Manipulation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Media file (audio/video).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Audio:** Isolate stems (vocals, drums, bass, harmony/melody) using source separation techniques.  Analyze each stem for key features: tempo, key, instrumentation, harmonic complexity, dynamic range.
    *   **Video:**  Scene detection, object recognition (identifying key elements in the scene), motion vector analysis, color palette extraction.
*   **Output:**  A set of adjustable parameters for each media component (stem/scene).

**3. Morphing Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Current mood state, adjustable media parameters.
*   **Processing:** Based on the mood state, apply transformations to the media parameters:
    *   **Joy:** Increase tempo, brighten color palettes, add harmonic richness, introduce more upbeat instrumentation, accelerate camera movements.
    *   **Sadness:** Decrease tempo, desaturate colors, simplify harmonic structures, introduce melancholic instrumentation, slow down camera movements.
    *   **Anger:** Increase distortion, emphasize low frequencies, introduce dissonant harmonies, utilize fast cuts/strobe effects.
    *   **Relaxation:** Lower tempo, introduce ambient textures, utilize soft color palettes, employ slow, panning camera movements.
*   **Output:** Transformed media stream.

**4. Adaptive Blend Engine:**

*   **Input:** Original media stream, transformed media stream, user feedback (optional).
*   **Processing:** Smoothly blend the original and transformed media streams based on a “morphing factor” (0-1).  The morphing factor is initially determined by the mood state and confidence level.  User feedback (e.g., a “less intense” button) can dynamically adjust the morphing factor.
*   **Output:** Final media stream presented to the user.

**Pseudocode Example (Mood-Based Tempo Adjustment):**

```
function adjustTempo(originalTempo, moodState, confidenceLevel) {
  baseTempoAdjustment = 0;

  if (moodState == "Joy") {
    baseTempoAdjustment = 1.1; // Increase by 10%
  } else if (moodState == "Sadness") {
    baseTempoAdjustment = 0.8; // Decrease by 20%
  } // Add other mood states

  //Adjust Tempo based on mood confidence
  adjustedTempo = originalTempo * (1 + (baseTempoAdjustment - 1) * confidenceLevel);

  return adjustedTempo;
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance CPU/GPU for real-time media processing.
*   Wearable sensor integration (Bluetooth).
*   Low-latency audio/video output.
*   Sufficient memory for storing media assets and model parameters.
