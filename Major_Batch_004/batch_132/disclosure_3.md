## Adaptive Content Reconstruction via Multi-Modal Sensory Fusion

**Concept:** Extend speech-based content retrieval to proactively *reconstruct* content based on inferred user intent and sensory input *beyond* just audio. This moves beyond simply finding existing content to dynamically crafting personalized experiences.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sensory Input Layer:**

*   **Audio Input:** Existing speech processing pipeline (as in the patent) – speech-to-text, intent recognition.
*   **Visual Input:** Integrate a camera feed (device-mounted or external). Implement object recognition, scene understanding, and facial expression analysis.
*   **Environmental Input:** Integrate access to device sensors: GPS location, ambient lighting, temperature, motion sensors, accelerometer.
*   **Biometric Input (Optional):** Heart rate (via wearable integration), skin conductance. (Requires explicit user permission).

**2. Intent Inference Engine:**

*   **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Combine data from all sensory inputs. Use a weighted scoring system to prioritize data sources based on context (e.g., in a noisy environment, prioritize visual input).
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Maintain a user profile (with user permission) tracking preferences, habits, and past interactions. Leverage historical data to improve inference accuracy.
*   **Intent Hierarchy:** Define a hierarchy of user intents:
    *   **Explicit Intent:** Directly stated via speech (e.g., “Play jazz music”).
    *   **Implicit Intent:** Inferred from sensory data (e.g., user looking at a recipe book suggests interest in cooking).
    *   **Predictive Intent:** Anticipated based on historical data and current context (e.g., user typically starts a workout at 6 PM – proactively suggest a workout playlist).

**3. Content Reconstruction Module:**

*   **Modular Content Sources:** Design a system supporting diverse content types:
    *   **Existing Content Libraries:** Integrate with streaming services, music libraries, video platforms.
    *   **Generative AI Models:** Connect to large language models, image generation models, music composition tools.
    *   **Real-Time Data Feeds:** Access weather data, news feeds, social media updates.
*   **Dynamic Content Assembly:**  Combine content fragments from multiple sources to create personalized experiences:
    *   **Music Playlists:** Generate playlists based on inferred mood, activity, and preferences.
    *   **Visual Storytelling:** Create dynamic slideshows or short videos combining images, video clips, and text overlays.
    *   **Interactive Experiences:** Build personalized games or simulations based on user input and context.
*   **Metadata Generation:** Create rich metadata describing the reconstructed content:
    *   **Sensory Context:**  Record the sensory inputs that influenced the content creation process (e.g., time of day, location, user mood).
    *   **Content Provenance:** Track the source of each content fragment and the transformations applied to it.
    *   **User Feedback:**  Capture user reactions to the reconstructed content to improve future personalization.

**4. Output & Presentation Layer:**

*   **Adaptive Output Templates:**  Dynamically select output templates based on the content type and device capabilities.
*   **Multi-Modal Output:**  Deliver content through multiple channels:
    *   **Visual Display:**  Present content on a screen or projector.
    *   **Audio Output:**  Play music, podcasts, or audiobooks.
    *   **Haptic Feedback:**  Provide tactile feedback through a wearable device.
*   **Interactive Control:**  Allow users to refine the reconstructed content through voice commands, gestures, or touch input.

**Pseudocode (Content Reconstruction Module):**

```
function reconstruct_content(user_profile, sensory_inputs):
    inferred_intent = infer_intent(user_profile, sensory_inputs)

    content_fragments = []

    if inferred_intent.type == "music":
        content_fragments = generate_music_playlist(inferred_intent.mood, inferred_intent.activity)
    elif inferred_intent.type == "visual_storytelling":
        content_fragments = create_visual_story(inferred_intent.topic, sensory_inputs.location)
    else:
        content_fragments = retrieve_relevant_content(inferred_intent.query)

    metadata = generate_metadata(content_fragments, sensory_inputs, inferred_intent)

    return content_fragments, metadata
```
