**Automated Inventory 'Ghosting' & Predictive Relocation**

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Components:**
    *   Real-time Location System (RTLS): Ultra-wideband (UWB) or high-precision Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon infrastructure throughout the materials handling facility.
    *   Computer Vision System: Network of high-resolution cameras covering all inventory locations and movement pathways.
    *   Predictive Analytics Engine: Machine learning model trained on historical interaction data, item characteristics, and real-time location/vision data.
    *   Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) / Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) Integration: Direct communication interface for relocation requests.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   RTLS Data: User and item locations (X, Y, Z coordinates) with timestamp.
    *   Computer Vision Data: Item identification (via object recognition), user identification (facial recognition or wearable tag), action detection (picking, placing, scanning).
    *   Interaction Data: Past transaction data, item lists, user profiles, item characteristics (weight, size, fragility, demand).
    *   Environmental Data: Temperature, humidity, light levels (may affect item condition/demand).
*   **Process Flow:**

    1.  **'Ghost' Item Creation:** When an item remains stationary at an inventory location for a pre-defined period (configurable), the system creates a "ghost" representation of that item in the digital inventory.  The ghost item retains all historical data but is flagged as potentially misplaced or overlooked.
    2.  **Predictive Relocation Trigger:** The Predictive Analytics Engine analyzes several factors:
        *   Item demand (based on historical sales data and current trends).
        *   Item location relative to picking paths (identified via historical pick data).
        *   Inventory congestion (density of items in the current location).
        *   Proximity to relevant picking stations.
        *   Item 'ghost' status & duration.
        If the Engine determines that relocation would significantly improve picking efficiency or reduce the risk of missed picks, it generates a relocation request.
    3.  **AGV/AMR Task Assignment:** The system assigns a relocation task to the nearest available AGV/AMR, providing the source and destination locations.
    4.  **Vision-Guided Navigation & Verification:** The AGV/AMR uses computer vision to navigate to the source location, verify the item's presence and identity, and then navigate to the destination location.
    5.  **Digital Inventory Update:** Once the item is successfully relocated, the digital inventory is updated with the new location, and the 'ghost' status is removed.

*   **Pseudocode (Relocation Decision Logic):**

    ```
    FUNCTION DetermineRelocation(item, currentLocation, historicalData)
    IF item.ghostStatus == TRUE AND item.ghostDuration > threshold
        relocationScore = 100
    ELSE
        relocationScore = 0

    demandScore = CalculateDemandScore(historicalData) // Higher score = higher demand
    locationScore = CalculateLocationScore(currentLocation) // Lower score = closer to picking path
    congestionScore = CalculateCongestionScore(currentLocation) // Higher score = more congested

    totalScore = relocationScore + demandScore - locationScore + congestionScore

    IF totalScore > threshold
        RETURN TRUE // Recommend relocation
    ELSE
        RETURN FALSE // No relocation needed
    END IF
    END FUNCTION
    ```

*   **Additional Considerations:**
    *   Dynamic Thresholds: Adapt thresholds based on real-time inventory levels and facility workload.
    *   User Override: Allow users to manually trigger or cancel relocation requests.
    *   Exception Handling: Implement robust error handling for cases where items are missing or AGVs/AMRs encounter obstacles.
    *   Integration with Warehouse Management System (WMS): Seamlessly integrate with existing WMS for comprehensive inventory control.
