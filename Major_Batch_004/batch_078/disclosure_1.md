**Dynamic Interest Space Projection – “Aura”**

**Concept:** Expand the interest space visualization beyond a flat representation. Project a 3D "aura" around the user reflecting the intensity of their engagement with different content sources. This aura dynamically shifts and changes color/brightness based on real-time navigation and interaction.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:** Real-time navigation data (URLs visited, time spent on page, interactions – likes, shares, comments), user profile data (explicit interests, demographics), and community data (shared interests within the user’s network).
*   **3D Projection:** Implement a 3D spatial model around the user's virtual representation (avatar/profile icon) within the browsing environment.  This projection space is defined by a spherical volume (radius adjustable by user preference).
*   **Content Source Mapping:**  Map each online content source (website, video channel, social media group) to a point within the 3D projection space.  Positioning is determined by semantic similarity (using NLP to analyze content), historical user interaction, and community overlap.
*   **Intensity Visualization:** Represent user engagement with each content source using visual properties within the 3D projection:
    *   **Distance from User:** Closer points = higher engagement/recency.
    *   **Brightness:** Intensity of interaction (time spent, number of actions).
    *   **Color:** Categorical representation of content type (news = blue, video = red, social = purple, etc.).  Color saturation could also reflect sentiment analysis of content consumed.
    *   **Size:** Number of shared connections/community members also engaging with that content.
*   **Real-Time Updates:** The 3D aura dynamically updates as the user navigates and interacts with content.  Transitions between states should be smooth and visually appealing.
*   **Interaction Layer:**
    *   **Click/Select:**  Allow users to click/select points within the aura to directly access the corresponding content source.
    *   **Filtering:** Implement filtering options to highlight specific content types or interests.
    *   **Community Overlay:** Display shared connections/community members who are also engaging with the selected content.
*   **Output:** A visually compelling and interactive 3D representation of the user’s interest space.

**Pseudocode (simplified update loop):**

```
For Each contentSource in interestSpace:
    engagementScore = calculateEngagementScore(contentSource, user)
    distance = mapEngagementScoreToDistance(engagementScore)
    brightness = mapEngagementScoreToBrightness(engagementScore)
    color = getContentSourceCategoryColor(contentSource)
    size = calculateCommunityOverlapSize(contentSource, user)
    
    update3DPoint(contentSource, distance, brightness, color, size)

Apply smoothing and transitions to 3D points
Render 3D Aura
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simple lists or graph-based visualizations. The 3D spatial representation provides a more intuitive and immersive way to understand the user’s interest space and discover new content. The dynamic aura adapts to the user’s behavior in real-time, creating a personalized and engaging experience. It moves away from the idea of 'displaying' community, and moves into the realm of 'experiencing' community, and dynamically visualizing the user's immediate sphere of influence based on interest.
