## Dynamic Predictive HDR based on User Gaze & Biofeedback

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Eye-tracking module integrated into device (phone, camera, AR/VR headset). Resolution: Minimum 60Hz tracking.
    *   Biofeedback sensor (heart rate variability (HRV), skin conductance) integrated into device.
    *   Dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for real-time analysis.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Gaze Prediction Module:**  Utilizes recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically LSTMs, to predict the userâ€™s focus of attention within the frame *before* image capture. Input:  Past gaze data, scene analysis (object detection, semantic segmentation), and device motion.  Output: Heatmap of predicted gaze focus with confidence scores.
    *   **Biofeedback Analysis Module:** Processes real-time HRV and skin conductance data to estimate user arousal and emotional state. Algorithms include time-domain and frequency-domain analysis of HRV. Output: Arousal/Emotional State score (e.g., 0-100 scale).
    *   **Dynamic HDR Engine:**  A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to adjust HDR parameters (tone mapping curves, local adaptation strength) *based* on the combined gaze prediction and biofeedback data.
    *   **Training Data:** Large dataset of images, gaze data, biofeedback data, and subjective HDR quality ratings.
    *   **Real-Time Pipeline:**
        1.  **Capture Pre-Analysis:** Before full image capture, the system rapidly analyzes the scene.
        2.  **Gaze Prediction:** The Gaze Prediction Module generates a predicted gaze heatmap.
        3.  **Biofeedback Acquisition:**  The Biofeedback Analysis Module collects and analyzes real-time HRV/skin conductance data.
        4.  **HDR Parameter Adjustment:** The Dynamic HDR Engine uses the predicted gaze heatmap, arousal/emotional state score, and scene information to dynamically adjust HDR parameters.  Priority is given to enhancing details in the area of predicted gaze. Higher arousal/emotional state scores can lead to more pronounced HDR effects.
        5.  **Image Capture & Processing:** Image is captured and processed with adjusted HDR parameters.
        6.  **Feedback Loop:** User interactions (e.g., manual HDR adjustment) are used to refine the model over time.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
load_model(HDR_Engine)
load_model(Gaze_Prediction)

// Real-time loop
while (device_active) {
    scene_data = capture_scene_data()
    gaze_heatmap = Gaze_Prediction(scene_data, past_gaze_data, device_motion)
    biofeedback_score = BiofeedbackAnalysis(HRV_data, skin_conductance_data)
    
    HDR_parameters = HDR_Engine(scene_data, gaze_heatmap, biofeedback_score)
    
    final_image = CaptureAndProcess(scene_data, HDR_parameters)
    
    display_image(final_image)
    
    //Feedback Loop (optional)
    if (user_adjustment) {
        update_model(HDR_Engine, user_adjustment)
    }
}
```

**Novelty:** Existing HDR systems typically rely on static scene analysis or user-defined settings. This system *predicts* where the user will look and *reacts* to their physiological state, creating a personalized HDR experience tailored to their attention and emotional response. It moves beyond simply enhancing the image to enhancing the *perception* of the image.
