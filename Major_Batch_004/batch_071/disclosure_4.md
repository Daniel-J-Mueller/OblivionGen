## Adaptive Acoustic Mapping with Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion

**System Overview:**

A mobile robotic platform (e.g., a smart speaker on a wheeled base, or a dedicated autonomous robot) equipped with:

*   **Microphone Array:** Similar to the patent's focus, but expanded to incorporate beamforming and spatial audio capture.
*   **Visual Sensor:** A depth camera (e.g., LiDAR or structured light) providing 3D point cloud data of the environment.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):**  Tracking the robot's orientation and movement.
*   **Processing Unit:**  Capable of real-time sensor fusion and acoustic mapping.

**Core Innovation:**  Dynamically generate and update a 3D acoustic map of a space by fusing audio source localization data with visual environmental mapping.  This goes beyond simply finding direction – it *reconstructs* the soundscape within the physical space.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:**
    *   Microphone array continuously captures audio.
    *   Depth camera generates a real-time 3D point cloud of the environment.
    *   IMU provides robot pose data.

2.  **Acoustic Source Localization (ASL):**
    *   Implement a modified SRP (Steered Response Power) algorithm.  Instead of directly determining azimuth, the algorithm outputs a *probability distribution* over potential 3D source locations within the observed point cloud.  This provides uncertainty estimation.
    *   Use the depth camera's point cloud to constrain the SRP search space, improving accuracy and reducing false positives.
    *   ASL runs at a frequency of 20-30 Hz.

3.  **Sensor Fusion – Kalman Filter:**
    *   Employ an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse the ASL data with the visual map and IMU data.
    *   **State Vector:** `[x, y, z, vx, vy, vz]` representing the 3D position and velocity of each detected sound source.
    *   **Process Model:**  Simple constant velocity model.
    *   **Measurement Model:**  ASL provides bearing and range estimates to the sound source.  The visual map provides constraints on the sound source's location (e.g., it cannot be located inside a wall).
    *   The EKF estimates the state vector for each detected sound source, providing a smoothed and accurate estimate of its location and velocity.

4.  **Acoustic Map Generation:**
    *   Represent the acoustic map as a voxel grid overlaid on the 3D point cloud.
    *   Each voxel stores:
        *   Average sound pressure level (SPL) over a time window.
        *   Estimated source location(s) contributing to the SPL.
        *   Confidence level of the source localization.
    *   Update the voxel grid in real-time based on the EKF output.

5.  **Dynamic Re-Mapping:**
    *   Implement a mechanism for dynamic re-mapping of the acoustic space.
    *   If a sound source disappears or moves significantly, the corresponding voxels are updated or cleared.
    *   This ensures that the acoustic map remains accurate and reflects the current soundscape.

**Pseudocode (EKF Update Step):**

```
// Assume:
// - State vector: x (position & velocity of sound source)
// - Measurement vector: z (bearing & range from ASL)
// - Process noise covariance: Q
// - Measurement noise covariance: R

// Prediction Step:
x_predicted = F * x_estimated // F is the state transition matrix
P_predicted = F * P_estimated * F.transpose() + Q

// Update Step:
y = z - H * x_predicted // Innovation (measurement residual)
S = H * P_predicted * H.transpose() + R // Innovation covariance
K = P_predicted * H.transpose() * S.inverse() // Kalman Gain
x_estimated = x_predicted + K * y
P_estimated = (I - K * H) * P_predicted
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Voice Assistants:** More accurate source localization for improved command recognition.
*   **Smart Security Systems:**  Detection and tracking of sound events for intrusion detection.
*   **Immersive Audio Experiences:**  Recreate realistic soundscapes for virtual and augmented reality applications.
*   **Acoustic Scene Understanding:**  Analyze the soundscape to identify objects and activities.
