## Modular, Self-Reconfiguring Container System

**System Overview:**

A network of foldable containers, as described in the provided patent, enhanced with magnetic coupling, internal pneumatic/hydraulic articulation, and a distributed processing network for automated reconfiguration and collective movement. These containers aren’t merely *transported* by robots; they *collaborate* with them and each other.

**Container Specifications:**

*   **Dimensions (Folded):** 60cm x 60cm x 15cm
*   **Dimensions (Unfolded):** 60cm x 60cm x 45cm
*   **Material:** Reinforced polymer composite with integrated magnetic elements. Walls include embedded pressure sensors.
*   **Magnetic Coupling:** High-strength neodymium magnets embedded in each wall and the bottom platform. Polarity control via internal electromagnets. Enables strong, directional connection to adjacent containers and robotic interfaces.
*   **Internal Articulation:** Miniature pneumatic/hydraulic pistons at each corner joint. Allows for minor adjustments in wall angle – crucial for creating complex configurations beyond simple unfolding.  Controlled by an internal microcontroller.
*   **Power:** Internal rechargeable battery. Wireless charging capability via induction.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth mesh network. Each container transmits and receives status information, configuration data, and commands.
*   **Payload Capacity:** 50kg
*   **Wheel Configuration:** Four omni-directional wheels, independently driven.
*   **Fiducial:** QR code on bottom platform, linked to container ID, contents, and destination.

**System Architecture:**

1.  **Container ID Assignment:** Each container receives a unique ID.
2.  **Central Control System (CCS):** A central server receives orders and manages the overall container network.
3.  **Distributed Processing:** Containers execute local commands and report status to the CCS.
4.  **Magnetic Locking Protocol:** The CCS sends signals to containers to engage/disengage magnetic locks, forming connections.
5.  **Articulation Protocol:** The CCS sends signals to containers to adjust internal articulation, optimizing configurations.
6.  **Collective Movement:** Containers coordinate wheel movements to move as a unified system.

**Pseudocode for Collective Movement & Reconfiguration:**

```
// CCS - Received Order: Transport Goods from Point A to Point B
function processOrder(order) {
  // 1. Route Planning
  route = planRoute(order.start, order.end);

  // 2. Container Allocation
  allocatedContainers = allocateContainers(order.goods, route);

  // 3. Container Configuration
  for (container in allocatedContainers) {
    // Based on goods size/shape and route constraints
    configuration = determineConfiguration(container.goods, route);

    // Send configuration command to container
    sendCommand(container.id, "configure", configuration);
  }

  // 4. Formation & Movement
  formation = determineFormation(allocatedContainers, route); // e.g., line, grid
  for (container in allocatedContainers) {
    sendCommand(container.id, "form", formation[container.id]); // Assign position/orientation
    sendCommand(container.id, "move", route); // Move to destination
  }
}

// Container - Received Command
function handleCommand(command) {
  switch (command.type) {
    case "configure":
      // Adjust internal articulation based on command parameters
      adjustArticulation(command.parameters);
      break;
    case "form":
      // Adjust wheel orientation and engage/disengage magnetic locks
      adjustPosition(command.parameters);
      break;
    case "move":
      // Follow route instructions and maintain formation
      followRoute(command.parameters);
      break;
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple transport to create a dynamic, self-reconfiguring network of containers. The integration of magnetic coupling, internal articulation, and distributed processing enables automated formation and movement, adapting to complex environments and payloads. This isn't just a container; it's a building block for a flexible logistics system.
