## Decentralized Organizational Identity Projection with Dynamic Trust Scoring

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting access permissions based on real-time trust scores derived from user behavior and resource interaction, extending the organization-level identity projection concept.

**Core Concept:** Instead of solely relying on hierarchical access granted through organization accounts and sub-accounts, integrate a dynamic trust scoring system that continuously evaluates user trustworthiness and adjusts resource access accordingly. This moves beyond static permissions toward a fluid, risk-adaptive access model.

**Components:**

*   **Trust Score Engine:**  A module responsible for calculating and maintaining trust scores for each user.  Inputs include:
    *   **Behavioral Biometrics:**  Keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, and usage patterns.
    *   **Resource Access History:** Frequency, type, and sensitivity of accessed resources.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Flags unusual behavior indicative of compromised accounts or malicious intent. (e.g., access attempts outside normal hours, from unusual locations).
    *   **External Threat Intelligence:** Integration with threat feeds to identify known malicious actors or compromised systems.
*   **Policy Engine:** Defines rules that map trust scores to access levels.  These rules are configurable and allow administrators to fine-tune the balance between security and usability.
*   **Dynamic Access Controller:**  Intercepts resource access requests and evaluates the user's current trust score against the policy engine rules. Based on this evaluation, access is either granted, denied, or subjected to additional security measures (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
*   **Organizational Hierarchy Integration:** Leverage the existing organizational hierarchy for initial access baselines, but allow trust scores to dynamically *override* or *augment* these permissions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// User attempts to access a resource
request = receiveResourceAccessRequest(user, resource)

// Retrieve user's current trust score
trustScore = getTrustScore(user)

// Retrieve organizational hierarchy access baseline
baselineAccess = getBaselineAccess(user, resource)

// Calculate dynamic access level
dynamicAccess = calculateDynamicAccess(baselineAccess, trustScore)

// Apply dynamic access control
if dynamicAccess == "granted":
    grantAccess(user, resource)
elif dynamicAccess == "denied":
    denyAccess(user, resource)
else if dynamicAccess == "challenge":
    triggerMultiFactorAuthentication(user)
    if authenticationSuccessful():
        grantAccess(user, resource)
    else:
        denyAccess(user, resource)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **User Profile:** {userID, organizationAccount, trustScore, lastActivityTimestamp, behavioralBiometrics}
*   **Resource Profile:** {resourceID, sensitivityLevel, accessControlList}
*   **Policy Rule:** {trustScoreThreshold, accessLevel, action}

**System Architecture:**

The system will operate as a modular extension to the existing identity management infrastructure.  A new "Trust Score Service" will be deployed, responsible for calculating and maintaining trust scores.  The Dynamic Access Controller will be implemented as a middleware component that intercepts resource access requests.

**Novelty:**  This system shifts from static, hierarchical access control to a dynamic, risk-adaptive model. It extends the organization-level identity projection concept by integrating real-time trust scoring, allowing organizations to respond to evolving security threats and adjust access permissions based on user behavior.
