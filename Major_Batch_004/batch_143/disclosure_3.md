## Dynamic Privilege Decay & "Ghost Access" Logging

**Concept:** Expand upon the similarity-based privilege expansion by introducing *temporal decay* to those granted privileges and a system for logging "ghost access" â€“ recording instances where a user *would* have had access based on past similarity, even after privilege decay. This builds a richer understanding of collaborative intent and potential knowledge gaps.

**Specifications:**

**1. Privilege Decay Function:**

*   **Parameter:** `DecayRate` (configurable per document/user group - e.g., 0.01/day, 0.1/week).  Represents the percentage of privilege lost per unit of time.
*   **Mechanism:**  Each granted privilege has an associated "Privilege Strength" value, initialized to 1.0. This value is reduced daily (or weekly, based on `DecayRate`).
*   **Threshold:**  When `PrivilegeStrength` falls below a configurable `AccessThreshold` (e.g., 0.2), access is revoked.  The user is *not* immediately informed; see "Ghost Access" below.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculate_privilege_strength(initial_strength, decay_rate, time_elapsed):
  return initial_strength * (1 - (decay_rate * time_elapsed))

function check_access(user, document, privilege_strength, access_threshold):
  if privilege_strength >= access_threshold:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

**2. "Ghost Access" Logging:**

*   **Mechanism:**  Even if `check_access` returns `False` due to decayed privileges, record the *attempted* access. This log entry includes:
    *   User ID
    *   Document ID
    *   Timestamp
    *   Previous `PrivilegeStrength` (at the time of the attempt)
    *   Reason: "Privilege Decay"

**3. Collaborative Intent Analysis:**

*   **Algorithm:**  Periodically (e.g., weekly), analyze the "Ghost Access" logs. Identify patterns:
    *   **Recurring Decay:**  Users repeatedly attempting to access the same document after privilege decay suggests ongoing interest.  This triggers a notification to the document owner/administrator with a recommendation to re-grant access or adjust the `DecayRate`.
    *   **"Follow" Detection:** If a user consistently attempts access to documents shortly *after* another user gains access, infer a potential collaborative "follow" relationship. Recommend proactive privilege expansion for the follower.

**4.  User Interface Integration:**

*   **"Access History" Panel:** Display a user's recent access attempts (including decayed access) alongside granted privileges.
*   **"Collaborative Insights" Dashboard:** For document owners/administrators, present summarized data from the Collaborative Intent Analysis, including recommendations for privilege adjustments.

**5. API Extensions:**

*   `getGhostAccessLog(userID, documentID, timeframe)`:  Retrieves a log of decayed access attempts.
*   `analyzeCollaboration(userID)`:  Returns a list of potential collaboration relationships based on access patterns.

**Novelty:**  Current systems focus on granting/revoking privileges based on static or infrequent re-evaluation of similarity. This expands that by modelling the *temporal* aspect of collaboration, inferring intent from access attempts even after privileges have decayed. The "Ghost Access" logging provides valuable data for proactive privilege management and improved collaboration discovery.
