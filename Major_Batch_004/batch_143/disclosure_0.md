## Dynamic Acoustic Mapping for Personalized Spatial Audio

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of miniature, low-power microphones (minimum 8, optimally 16+) integrated into wearable devices (earbuds, glasses, wristbands) and/or strategically placed static sensors within a defined space (room, vehicle).
    *   Dedicated edge processing unit within each device/sensor for initial signal processing and feature extraction.
    *   Central processing unit (cloud-based or on-premise) for data fusion, acoustic map generation, and audio rendering.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Data Acquisition:** Captures raw audio data from all microphones.  Data includes timestamp, microphone ID, and signal amplitude.
    *   **Source Localization Engine:** Uses Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and/or beamforming techniques to estimate the location of sound sources.  Handles multiple concurrent sound sources.
    *   **Acoustic Map Builder:** Creates a dynamic 3D representation of the acoustic environment.  The map stores information on sound source locations, material properties (absorption, reflection), and room geometry. This map is not static; it's continuously updated.
    *   **Personalized Audio Rendering Engine:**  Utilizes ray tracing and/or wave field synthesis techniques to render spatial audio tailored to the user's location and preferences.  Factors in head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) for realistic sound localization.
    *   **User Profile Management:** Stores user-specific preferences (preferred audio modes, volume levels, HRTF data) and device settings.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Microphones capture audio data.
    2.  Edge processing units perform noise reduction and feature extraction.
    3.  Processed data is streamed to the central processing unit.
    4.  The source localization engine estimates sound source locations.
    5.  The acoustic map builder updates the 3D acoustic map.
    6.  The personalized audio rendering engine generates spatial audio based on the acoustic map, user profile, and current listening context.
    7.  Rendered audio is streamed to the userâ€™s audio output devices.

**Innovation Detail:**

The system differs from traditional spatial audio solutions by actively *mapping* the acoustic environment in real-time and adapting audio rendering accordingly.  Instead of relying on pre-defined room models or static HRTFs, it creates a dynamic, personalized acoustic experience.

**Pseudocode for Acoustic Map Update:**

```
function updateAcousticMap(audioData, microphonePosition) {
  sourceLocation = localizeSoundSource(audioData);
  if (sourceLocation != null) {
    // Check if the source already exists in the map
    existingSource = findSourceInMap(sourceLocation);
    if (existingSource == null) {
      // Add new source to the map
      addSourceToMap(sourceLocation, audioData);
    } else {
      // Update existing source with new audio data
      updateSourceInMap(existingSource, audioData);
    }
  }

  // Apply ray tracing or wave field synthesis to create a rendered audio output
  renderedAudio = renderSpatialAudio(microphonePosition);
  return renderedAudio;
}

function renderSpatialAudio(microphonePosition) {
  //This function utilizes microphonePosition to determine where to render spatial audio
  //Based on the information derived from 'updateAcousticMap'
  //It performs all necessary calculations to deliver realistic and immersive sound.
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Immersive gaming and virtual reality experiences.
*   Enhanced teleconferencing and video calls.
*   Personalized audio for public spaces (e.g., airports, museums).
*   Accessibility tools for hearing-impaired individuals.
*   Advanced automotive audio systems.
