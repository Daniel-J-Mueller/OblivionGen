## Dynamic Contextual Keyword Generation via Multi-Modal Input

**Concept:** Expand keyword identification beyond text-based document analysis to incorporate visual and auditory data associated with the item being advertised. This creates a richer, more nuanced understanding of the item and identifies keywords that might be missed by traditional text-only methods.

**Specifications:**

**1. Input Module:**

*   **Textual Description:** Accepts the initial item description (as in the existing patent).
*   **Visual Input:** Accepts image(s) or video(s) of the item.
*   **Auditory Input:** Accepts audio related to the item (e.g., a demonstration, a jingle, ambient sound associated with its use).

**2. Multi-Modal Feature Extraction:**

*   **Textual Analysis:** Standard NLP techniques (tokenization, stemming, stop word removal) as per the provided patent.
*   **Visual Analysis:**
    *   Employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pre-trained on a large image dataset (e.g., ImageNet).
    *   Extract feature vectors representing visual characteristics (shapes, colors, textures, objects).
    *   Object Detection: Implement object detection (e.g., YOLO, SSD) to identify specific objects within the image.
*   **Auditory Analysis:**
    *   Employ a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Transformer model pre-trained on audio data.
    *   Extract feature vectors representing audio characteristics (frequencies, amplitudes, patterns).
    *   Audio Event Detection: Implement audio event detection to identify specific sounds (e.g., engine noise, music genre).

**3. Feature Fusion & Semantic Mapping:**

*   **Concatenation:** Concatenate the feature vectors from textual, visual, and auditory analyses into a single feature vector.
*   **Weighted Summation:** Assign weights to each modality based on its perceived relevance (configurable by user/algorithm).
*   **Semantic Embedding:** Map the combined feature vector into a semantic space using a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, GPT-3). This provides a contextualized representation of the item.

**4. Keyword Generation & Scoring:**

*   **Phrase Extraction:** Use the semantic embedding to identify potential phrases that are strongly associated with the item.  This is an evolution of the phrase identification in the existing patent, but now driven by multi-modal data.
*   **Keyword Scoring:**
    *   **Relevance Score:** Based on the distance between the semantic embedding of the phrase and the semantic embedding of the item.
    *   **Novelty Score:** Compare the phrase against a corpus of existing search terms (to identify potentially underserved niches).
    *   **Trend Score:** Analyze search volume data (Google Trends, etc.) to assess the popularity of the phrase.
*   **Keyword Filtering:** Remove irrelevant or low-scoring keywords based on configurable thresholds.

**5. Dynamic Adjustment & Feedback Loop:**

*   **Ad Performance Monitoring:** Track the performance of ads using the generated keywords (CTR, conversion rate).
*   **Keyword Weight Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust the weights assigned to each modality (text, visual, auditory) based on ad performance.
*   **Feedback to Model:** Use ad performance data to fine-tune the multi-modal feature extraction and keyword generation models.



**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateKeywords(itemDescription, image, audio):
  textFeatures = extractTextFeatures(itemDescription)
  visualFeatures = extractVisualFeatures(image)
  audioFeatures = extractAudioFeatures(audio)

  combinedFeatures = fuseFeatures(textFeatures, visualFeatures, audioFeatures)
  semanticEmbedding = mapToSemanticSpace(combinedFeatures)

  potentialPhrases = extractPhrases(semanticEmbedding)

  scoredPhrases = scorePhrases(potentialPhrases, semanticEmbedding)

  filteredPhrases = filterPhrases(scoredPhrases)

  return filteredPhrases
```
