## Adaptive Acoustic Mapping with Multi-Device Sensor Fusion

**Concept:** Extend inter-device bearing estimation to construct a dynamic, localized acoustic map. The system will leverage beamforming data *not* just for device-to-device localization, but to identify and map sound source locations relative to a network of devices. This creates a ‘sound bubble’ around the user/network, enhancing spatial audio, targeted notifications, and environmental awareness.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-device network (phones, tablets, smart speakers) equipped with microphone arrays and wireless communication (WiFi, Bluetooth).
    *   Each device includes a motion sensor (IMU) and a processor capable of running beamforming algorithms and sensor fusion.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Beamforming Engine:**  Processes microphone array data to identify direction-of-arrival (DoA) of sound sources. Output: Azimuth, elevation, and signal strength.
    *   **Motion Data Processor:** Filters and integrates IMU data to determine device orientation and movement. Output: Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw) and displacement vectors.
    *   **Sensor Fusion Engine:** Combines beamforming data and motion data to estimate the 3D location of sound sources relative to each device.  Utilizes a Kalman filter to smooth estimates and reduce noise.
    *   **Acoustic Mapping Module:**  Creates and maintains a dynamic 3D map of sound sources.  Uses a probabilistic occupancy grid to represent the spatial distribution of sound energy.
    *   **Localization Module:** Leverages existing inter-device bearing estimation (from the patent) *as a constraint* within the acoustic map.  If devices 'see' each other, their relative locations *must* be consistent with the map.
    *   **Notification/Audio Routing Engine:**  Routes audio or notifications to the device(s) closest to the sound source (or target location).

**Pseudocode (Sensor Fusion Engine):**

```
FUNCTION fuse_data(beamforming_data, motion_data):

    # beamforming_data: {azimuth, elevation, signal_strength}
    # motion_data: {roll, pitch, yaw, displacement}

    # 1. Transform beamforming angles (azimuth, elevation) from device coordinates to a global coordinate system using motion_data (roll, pitch, yaw).

    global_azimuth, global_elevation = transform_coordinates(beamforming_data, motion_data)

    # 2. Use ray tracing from the device to intersect with the probabilistic occupancy grid.
    #    The signal strength influences the occupancy probability at the intersection point.

    intersection_point = raytrace(global_azimuth, global_elevation)
    update_occupancy_grid(intersection_point, signal_strength)

    # 3. Apply Kalman filter to smooth occupancy grid data and reduce noise.

    filtered_occupancy_grid = kalman_filter(occupancy_grid)

    RETURN filtered_occupancy_grid
```

**Refinements & Potential Applications:**

*   **Echo Cancellation/Beam Steering:** Utilize the acoustic map to actively steer audio output to minimize reflections and create a more immersive experience.
*   **Privacy Zones:** Define ‘quiet zones’ where audio notifications are suppressed.
*   **Smart Home Control:** Trigger actions based on sound events (e.g., turn on lights when a voice is detected).
*   **Augmented Reality:** Overlay audio information onto the real world based on the location of sound sources.
*   **Emergency Alerts:**  Pinpoint the location of emergency sounds (e.g., a baby crying) and alert caregivers.
*   **Personalized Audio Spaces:** Create a ‘sound bubble’ that follows the user around, providing localized audio content.
