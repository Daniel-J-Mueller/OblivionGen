## Dynamic Attribute Importance Weighting

**Concept:** Expand the system to dynamically adjust attribute importance weights during classifier training and inference, based on real-time user interaction and catalog performance data. This moves beyond static weights generated solely from annotated images, allowing the system to adapt to evolving trends, nuanced item descriptions, and user preferences.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Streams:** Integrate three primary data streams:
    *   *User Correction Rate*: Track instances where users manually edit suggested attribute modifications. Higher correction rates for specific attributes indicate lower confidence in the classifier's initial prediction for those attributes.
    *   *Purchase Correlation*: Monitor the correlation between specific attributes and purchase completion rates. Attributes strongly correlated with purchases are deemed more important.
    *   *Search Query Data*: Analyze user search queries to identify frequently requested (but potentially missing) attributes for certain item categories.
*   **Weight Adjustment Algorithm:** Implement a dynamic weighting algorithm (e.g., a reinforcement learning model) that:
    *   *Receives* data from the three data streams.
    *   *Calculates* a 'relevance score' for each attribute based on the combined data.  A formula could be: `Relevance Score = (1 - Correction Rate) * Purchase Correlation * Search Query Frequency`.
    *   *Adjusts* the classifier's attribute weights proportionally to the relevance scores.  Higher relevance scores lead to increased weight.
*   **Training Pipeline Enhancement:**
    *   *Augment* the existing annotated image dataset with synthetically generated data.  For example, create variations of images with certain attributes subtly altered to emphasize those attributes during training.
    *   *Introduce* a ‘noise injection’ phase during training where attribute annotations are randomly perturbed to simulate real-world imperfections and encourage robust learning.
*   **Inference Optimization:**
    *   *Implement* a confidence threshold for attribute predictions. If the classifier’s confidence in a particular attribute falls below the threshold, prompt the user for clarification.
    *   *Use* a ‘multi-stage’ inference process. First, identify the most probable attributes with high confidence. Then, use a secondary classifier to refine the prediction for less confident attributes, incorporating contextual information from the item description and user history.

**Pseudocode (Weight Adjustment Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION update_attribute_weights(correction_rate_data, purchase_correlation_data, search_query_data, current_weights):

    // Calculate relevance scores for each attribute
    FOR each attribute in attribute_list:
        correction_rate = correction_rate_data[attribute]
        purchase_correlation = purchase_correlation_data[attribute]
        search_query_frequency = search_query_data[attribute]

        relevance_score = (1 - correction_rate) * purchase_correlation * search_query_frequency

        // Normalize relevance scores to ensure stability
        normalized_relevance_score = normalize(relevance_score)

        // Update attribute weights proportionally to normalized relevance scores
        new_weight = current_weight[attribute] + (normalized_relevance_score * learning_rate)

    // Ensure weights sum to 1
    normalize(new_weights)

    RETURN new_weights
```
