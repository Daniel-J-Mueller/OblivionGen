## Dynamic Voxel Resolution & Predictive Collision Mapping

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A hierarchical voxel map system combined with a short-term trajectory prediction engine.
*   **Voxel Hierarchy:** Multi-resolution voxels. Base layer: 1cm³. Higher layers progressively increase voxel size (e.g., 2cm³, 4cm³, 8cm³), representing larger areas with decreasing detail.
*   **Prediction Engine:** Estimates object trajectory for the next 0.5-2 seconds, based on velocity, acceleration, and pre-defined motion profiles (e.g., linear, circular, evasive maneuvers).
*   **Sensor Fusion:** Integrates data from depth sensors, cameras (for semantic understanding of obstacles), and inertial measurement units (IMUs) for accurate localization and object tracking.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance CPU/GPU cluster capable of real-time voxel map updates and trajectory prediction.
*   **Memory:** Large-capacity RAM for storing voxel maps, trajectory data, and prediction models.

**Operational Overview:**

1.  **Initial Map Creation:** Generate a base-resolution voxel map representing the static environment using sensor data.
2.  **Dynamic Layering:**  As objects move within the environment, populate higher-resolution voxel layers surrounding those objects, reflecting their dynamic boundaries.
3.  **Trajectory Prediction:** For each detected moving object, predict its trajectory over a short time horizon.
4.  **Predictive Voxel Projection:**  Project the predicted trajectory onto the voxel map, creating a "sweep volume" of occupied voxels representing the object’s predicted future positions.  This sweep volume is populated into the higher-resolution layers.
5.  **Collision Detection:**  Compare the sweep volume with the existing voxel map. Collisions are flagged if the sweep volume overlaps with occupied voxels.
6.  **Adaptive Resolution:** The system dynamically adjusts the voxel resolution based on object proximity and velocity.  Faster-moving objects and closer proximity trigger higher resolution for improved accuracy.
7.  **Evasive Maneuver Planning:**  If a collision is predicted, the system generates potential evasive maneuvers based on the object’s capabilities and the surrounding environment.  These maneuvers are then evaluated using the voxel map to identify collision-free paths.

**Pseudocode (Collision Prediction & Evasion):**

```
FUNCTION predict_collision(object, voxel_map, prediction_horizon)
  trajectory = predict_trajectory(object, prediction_horizon)
  sweep_volume = create_sweep_volume(trajectory)
  collision = check_collision(sweep_volume, voxel_map)
  RETURN collision

FUNCTION generate_evasive_maneuvers(object, obstacle, voxel_map)
  maneuvers = []
  // Define possible maneuvers (e.g., left, right, up, down, stop)
  FOR maneuver IN possible_maneuvers:
    new_trajectory = calculate_trajectory(object, maneuver)
    IF !predict_collision(object, voxel_map, prediction_horizon):
      maneuvers.append(maneuver)
  RETURN maneuvers

FUNCTION execute_maneuver(object, maneuver):
  // Implement the chosen maneuver
  // Update object's trajectory accordingly
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   **High-resolution depth sensor:** For detailed environmental mapping.
*   **Wide-angle camera:** For object detection and semantic understanding.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** For accurate object tracking and motion estimation.
*   **GPU-accelerated processing unit:** For real-time voxel map updates and collision detection.
*   **Solid-state storage:** For fast data access and storage.
