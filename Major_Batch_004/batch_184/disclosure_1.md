## Dynamic Cart Persona System

**Concept:** Extend shared cart functionality by allowing users to create and assign “Cart Personas” which define spending limits, item preferences, and notification settings within the shared cart. This goes beyond simple permission controls; it creates sub-accounts *within* the shared cart.

**Specs:**

**1. Persona Creation & Assignment:**

*   **Interface:** Within the shared cart application, a “Manage Personas” section.
*   **Fields:**
    *   Persona Name (e.g., “Sarah’s Gifts”, “Vacation Fund”, “Emergency Supplies”)
    *   Spending Limit: Maximum amount the persona can contribute/spend within the cart.
    *   Category Preferences:  List of item categories (e.g., electronics, clothing, books).  Assign weighting (high, medium, low) to indicate preference.
    *   Notification Settings: Specify what events trigger notifications for this persona (e.g., item added, price drop, purchase completed).  Granularity:  Notify only on preferred categories.
    *   Persona Owner: The user who created the persona.
*   **Assignment:**  Any user within the shared cart can be assigned to a persona.  One user can be assigned to multiple personas.

**2. Cart Filtering & Display:**

*   **Persona View:** Users can select a persona to filter the cart display. Only items relevant to that persona’s preferences are shown.
*   **Highlighting:**  Items matching a persona’s preferred categories are visually highlighted.
*   **Spending Tracker:** Display a spending tracker for each persona, showing how much has been spent and remaining balance.

**3.  Automated Cart Actions:**

*   **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Based on persona preferences, the system suggests items to add to the cart.
*   **Price Alerts:** Notify the persona owner when items in preferred categories drop below a specified price.
*   **Automatic Item Addition:** (Optional, user-controlled)  If a highly preferred item is on sale and within budget, automatically add it to the cart.
*    **Budget Allocation:** The system assists with budget allocation among personas, allowing the owner to split funds or reallocate them based on current needs.

**4.  Technical Implementation (Pseudocode):**

```
class SharedCart:
    personas = []

    def add_persona(self, persona):
        personas.append(persona)

    def filter_items(self, items, persona):
        filtered_items = []
        for item in items:
            if item.category in persona.preferred_categories and item.price <= persona.remaining_budget:
                filtered_items.append(item)
        return filtered_items

class Persona:
    def __init__(self, name, spending_limit, preferred_categories):
        self.name = name
        self.spending_limit = spending_limit
        self.preferred_categories = preferred_categories
        self.remaining_budget = spending_limit

    def spend(self, amount):
        self.remaining_budget -= amount

    def is_within_budget(self, price):
        return price <= self.remaining_budget
```

**5. Use Cases:**

*   **Family Gift Fund:** Create a persona for each family member, setting a budget and preferred gift categories.
*   **Vacation Planning:**  Create personas for different aspects of a vacation (e.g., "Flights," "Accommodation," "Activities").
*   **Group Project Supplies:**  Share a cart for a group project, assigning personas to different task areas and budgets.
*   **Emergency Preparedness:** Create a persona for emergency supplies, setting a budget and preferred items.
