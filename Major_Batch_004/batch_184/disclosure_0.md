## Adaptive Health Check Granularity

**Specification:** Implement a dynamic health check system where the frequency and depth of checks vary *based on observed traffic patterns and service dependencies*.  The existing heartbeat/gossip protocol is insufficient; it treats all nodes and services as equal. We need nuance.

**Components:**

1.  **Dependency Graph:**  A continuously updated graph representing service dependencies within the load-balanced environment. This is constructed via traffic analysis (observing which services call which others) and can be initially seeded with known architectural information.
2.  **Traffic Monitoring Agent:**  Deployed on each load balancer node.  Monitors request rates, latency, and error rates for all backend services.
3.  **Risk Assessment Engine:**  Analyzes data from the Dependency Graph and Traffic Monitoring Agent.  Calculates a “Risk Score” for each backend service.  Higher scores indicate greater potential impact if the service fails (high dependency, high traffic, increasing latency/errors).
4.  **Adaptive Health Check Controller:**  Adjusts the health check frequency and depth for each service *based on its Risk Score*.

**Health Check Levels:**

*   **Level 1 (Basic):** Heartbeat check (existing functionality) – lowest frequency. Applied to low-risk services.
*   **Level 2 (Standard):**  Heartbeat + basic request to a representative endpoint.  Moderate frequency. Applied to medium-risk services.
*   **Level 3 (Detailed):**  Heartbeat + multiple requests to different endpoints, including complex transactions. High frequency. Applied to high-risk services.  Simulates a typical user journey.
*   **Level 4 (Proactive):** Continuous monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs) via dedicated probes *before* an actual request is made.  Highest frequency. Used for critical services. This requires deeper integration with the service itself.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Health Check Controller):**

```
function adjust_health_check(service_name, risk_score):
  if risk_score < 30:
    level = 1 // Basic
    frequency = 60 seconds
  else if risk_score < 70:
    level = 2 // Standard
    frequency = 30 seconds
  else if risk_score < 90:
    level = 3 // Detailed
    frequency = 10 seconds
  else:
    level = 4 // Proactive
    frequency = 2 seconds

  // Update health check configuration for service_name
  configure_health_check(service_name, level, frequency)
end function

function configure_health_check(service_name, level, frequency):
  // Logic to update health check parameters on load balancer
  // (e.g., using configuration files, API calls)
end function

// Main loop (runs periodically)
for each service in dependency_graph:
  risk_score = calculate_risk_score(service)
  adjust_health_check(service, risk_score)
end for
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   The `calculate_risk_score` function should consider:
    *   Number of dependent services.
    *   Request rate to the service.
    *   Latency and error rate of the service.
    *   Criticality of the service (can be manually configured).
*   Level 4 requires service cooperation (e.g., exposing specific endpoints for KPI monitoring).
*   The system should be able to dynamically adjust health check parameters in response to changes in traffic patterns or service behavior.
*   Alerting and escalation policies should be integrated with the health check system.
