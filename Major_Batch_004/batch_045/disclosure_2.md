## Secure Device Attestation with Dynamic Root of Trust

**Concept:** Leverage the certificate registration system not just for initial trust establishment, but for *ongoing* device attestation, and dynamically shift the root of trust based on device behavior and security posture.

**Specs:**

**1. Attestation Agent (Device-Side):**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors device integrity (boot process, system calls, memory access).
*   **Hardware Binding:** Securely bound to a unique hardware identifier (e.g., TPM, secure enclave).
*   **Attestation Report Generation:** Generates a signed attestation report containing:
    *   Hardware identifier.
    *   Boot chain integrity measurements (hashes of each stage).
    *   System state measurements (running processes, critical system files).
    *   Timestamp.
    *   Current Root of Trust certificate chain identifier.
*   **Dynamic Root of Trust Selection:**  Based on device health, selects a Root of Trust certificate from a pre-approved list (managed by the Service Provider) or requests a new one. This list is tiered, with higher tiers representing stronger security postures.
*   **Report Submission:** Periodically submits attestation reports to the Attestation Verifier.

**2. Attestation Verifier (Service Provider-Side):**

*   **Report Reception:** Receives attestation reports from devices.
*   **Signature Verification:** Verifies the signature on the report using the device's registered public key (obtained during initial registration/provisioning).
*   **Integrity Check:** Validates the boot chain and system state measurements against a known-good baseline.
*   **Root of Trust Validation:** Verifies the selected Root of Trust certificate chain.
*   **Risk Scoring:** Assigns a risk score to the device based on attestation results and historical behavior.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** Based on the risk score, enforces access control policies (e.g., granting/denying access to sensitive resources, triggering security alerts).
*   **Dynamic Root of Trust Provisioning:**  If the device is deemed to be compromised, provisions a new, stronger Root of Trust certificate, and revokes the previous one.  This provisioning process *utilizes* the existing registration token mechanism to ensure authorized updates.

**3. Certificate Authority Integration:**

*   **Tiered Certificate Chains:** The CA issues tiered certificate chains, reflecting different security levels. A device may move between tiers based on its security posture.
*   **Automated Revocation:** Automated system for revoking compromised certificates.
*   **Certificate Revocation List (CRL) / Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Integration:** Robust CRL/OCSP mechanisms for checking certificate validity.

**Pseudocode (Attestation Verifier - Core Logic):**

```
function verifyAttestationReport(report, deviceId):
  signatureValid = verifySignature(report, deviceId)
  if not signatureValid:
    return false, "Invalid Signature"

  integrityValid = checkIntegrity(report)
  if not integrityValid:
    return false, "Integrity Check Failed"

  rootOfTrustValid = verifyRootOfTrust(report.rootOfTrustChain)
  if not rootOfTrustValid:
    return false, "Invalid Root of Trust"

  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(deviceId, riskScoreHistory)

  if riskScore > threshold:
    provisionNewRootOfTrust(deviceId)

  return true, "Attestation Successful"
```

**Novelty:**

This approach moves beyond simple certificate validation at registration and introduces continuous attestation.  The dynamic Root of Trust mechanism allows the service provider to adapt to changing security conditions and proactively mitigate threats. It utilizes the existing certificate registration framework as a foundational element for building a more robust and adaptive security system.  Existing methods typically rely on static trust anchors; this system offers a *dynamic* trust anchor, creating a much higher barrier to entry for attackers.
