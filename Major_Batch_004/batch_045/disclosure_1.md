## Transactional Event Stream Mirroring & Predictive Backfill

**Concept:** Extend the multi-stream transactional event processing to incorporate automated, predictive stream mirroring and backfill capabilities. This creates a self-healing and highly available system, drastically reducing data loss in failure scenarios and allowing for proactive scaling.

**Specifications:**

**1. Mirror Stream Creation:**

*   Upon initiating a new transaction spanning multiple data streams, *concurrently* create ‘mirror’ streams for each involved stream. These mirror streams are initialized as empty copies of the original streams, residing on *separate* shards (potentially in different availability zones).
*   The transaction coordinator manages these mirror streams transparently, ensuring any writes within the transaction are replicated to both the primary and mirror streams *before* committing.
*   Mirror stream shards are configured with lower replication factors initially, to minimize write amplification.

**2. Predictive Backfill Mechanism:**

*   Implement a background service – the “Predictive Backfill Agent” – that continuously analyzes transaction logs and identifies patterns of cross-stream event correlation.
*   The agent utilizes time-series analysis and machine learning (specifically, sequence prediction models) to *predict* future events that are likely to occur within ongoing transactions.
*   Based on these predictions, the agent proactively backfills data into mirror streams *before* the events are actually written by the client. This minimizes latency in failure scenarios.

**3. Failure Detection & Automatic Switchover:**

*   Implement health checks on primary stream shards.
*   Upon detecting a failure in a primary shard (e.g., due to node failure, network partition), the transaction coordinator automatically switches read/write operations to the corresponding mirror stream.
*   The switchover is designed to be near-instantaneous, minimizing disruption to client applications.

**4. Reconciliation & Conflict Resolution:**

*   Once the primary shard is restored, a reconciliation process is initiated.
*   The system compares the data in the primary shard with the mirror shard.
*   Any conflicts are resolved using a last-write-wins strategy (with configurable timestamps).  More advanced conflict resolution mechanisms (e.g., version vectors) can be integrated.

**5. Scalability & Dynamic Adjustment:**

*   The number of mirror streams, their shard allocation, and replication factors are configurable and adjustable based on traffic patterns and system load.
*   Auto-scaling rules can be defined to automatically increase or decrease the number of mirror streams and their resources.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Backfill Agent):**

```
function analyze_transaction_logs(logs):
  patterns = detect_cross_stream_patterns(logs)
  return patterns

function predict_future_events(patterns, current_transaction):
  predicted_events = sequence_prediction_model.predict(patterns, current_transaction)
  return predicted_events

function backfill_mirror_stream(predicted_events, mirror_stream):
  for event in predicted_events:
    write_event_to_mirror_stream(event, mirror_stream)

function main():
  logs = read_transaction_logs()
  patterns = analyze_transaction_logs(logs)
  current_transaction = get_current_transaction()
  predicted_events = predict_future_events(patterns, current_transaction)
  mirror_stream = get_mirror_stream()
  backfill_mirror_stream(predicted_events, mirror_stream)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `TransactionLogEntry`:  Includes transaction ID, stream IDs, shard IDs, event data, and transaction status.
*   `MirrorStreamMetadata`:  Contains information about the corresponding primary stream, shard location, replication factor, and status.
*   `PredictionModel`:  A trained machine learning model for sequence prediction.

**Dependencies:**

*   Machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Time-series analysis libraries.
*   Non-volatile storage (for transaction logs and mirror streams).
