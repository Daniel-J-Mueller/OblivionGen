## Dynamic Inventory "Aging" & Predictive Bundling

**Concept:** Extend the profitability evaluation to incorporate an "aging" factor for inventory, combined with a predictive bundling system. The core idea is to proactively bundle items *predicted* to become unprofitable soon with higher-margin items, effectively subsidizing the loss and encouraging offload. This moves beyond simple cost/revenue comparisons to dynamic, proactive risk mitigation.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Aging Factor Calculation:**
    *   Each inventory item receives an “aging score” derived from time since initial stocking *and* a predicted rate of diminishing profitability (based on historical sales data, seasonality, trends, etc.).
    *   Aging score is a value between 0-1 (0 = new, 1 = critically aged/unprofitable).
    *   Formula: `Aging Score = (Current Days in Stock / Predicted Lifespan) * WeightingFactor`. `WeightingFactor` is dynamically adjusted based on item category and demand volatility.

2.  **Bundle Prediction Engine:**
    *   Constantly analyzes inventory data, focusing on items with high aging scores.
    *   Utilizes machine learning (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering) to identify complementary items with strong current profitability.
    *   Predicts the "bundle uplift" - the increase in overall bundle revenue compared to selling items individually.
    *   Bundle uplift formula: `BundleUplift = (PredictedBundleRevenue - (Sum of Individual Item Revenues)) / Sum of Individual Item Revenues`.

3.  **Dynamic Bundle Creation & Pricing:**
    *   Automatically creates bundle recommendations based on bundle uplift threshold.  (e.g., only bundles with >5% uplift are considered).
    *   Pricing algorithm adjusts bundle price to maximize profit while incentivizing purchase. Considers:
        *   Individual item margins.
        *   Bundle uplift.
        *   Competitor pricing.
        *   Real-time demand.
    *   System generates a “bundle subsidy” amount - the amount of profit contributed by higher-margin items to offset the loss on aged items.

4.  **Real-Time Adjustment & A/B Testing:**
    *   System continuously monitors bundle performance (sales volume, profit margin).
    *   Automatically adjusts bundle composition and pricing based on real-time data.
    *   A/B testing of different bundle strategies (e.g., different bundle compositions, pricing models) to optimize performance.

**Pseudocode (Bundle Creation Logic):**

```
FUNCTION CreateBundles()
  FOR EACH Item IN Inventory:
    IF Item.AgingScore > Threshold:
      PotentialBundles = FindComplementaryItems(Item) //Use ML
      FOR EACH Bundle IN PotentialBundles:
        BundleUplift = CalculateBundleUplift(Bundle)
        IF BundleUplift > UpliftThreshold:
          BundlePrice = CalculateBundlePrice(Bundle)
          BundleSubsidy = CalculateBundleSubsidy(Bundle)
          CreateBundleOffer(Bundle, BundlePrice, BundleSubsidy)
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION FindComplementaryItems(AgedItem)
    // Machine learning algorithm to identify items frequently purchased with AgedItem OR 
    // items with high margin and relevant keywords/attributes
    RETURN ListOfPotentialBundleItems
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Detailed inventory records (cost, quantity, stocking date).
*   Sales history data (transaction details, items purchased together).
*   Product metadata (attributes, keywords, categories).
*   Real-time demand data (website traffic, search queries).
*   Competitor pricing data.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced inventory write-offs.
*   Increased revenue.
*   Improved inventory turnover.
*   Optimized pricing.
*   Proactive risk mitigation.
