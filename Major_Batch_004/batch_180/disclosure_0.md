## Secure Virtual Appliance Chaining with Dynamic Permission Drift

**Concept:** Extend the temporary credential system to facilitate secure, dynamically-chained virtual appliances operating across on-premises and remote environments.  Instead of simply granting access to resources, the system orchestrates a chain of virtual appliances, each performing a specific function, with credentials ‘drifting’ – being progressively refined and limited – as they move through the chain. This enables highly granular, auditable workflows without exposing broad permissions.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A “Drift Orchestrator” service residing on the on-premises computing management entity.
*   **Appliance Registry:** A central registry detailing available virtual appliances, their required input/output schemas, and permissible permission sets.  The registry supports versioning and rollback.
*   **Workflow Definition:**  Users define workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), specifying the appliance chain and data flow.
*   **Credential Drift Mechanism:** 
    *   Initial credentials, obtained as described in the base patent, are broad enough for the first appliance in the chain.
    *   Each appliance, upon completing its function, *modifies* the credentials – narrowing the scope of access, adding attestations about the processed data, or generating new credentials with limited lifespan.  This is done via a standardized API.
    *   The Drift Orchestrator enforces credential drift policies – ensuring credentials are only refined in permissible ways.
    *   Credential modification history is logged for auditability.
*   **Virtual Device Attachment:** Extend the existing virtual device attachment mechanism to support “credential containers.” These containers hold the current credential set and enforce access control policies.
*   **API Specification:**
    *   `RegisterAppliance(appliance_name, schema, permissions)` – Registers a new virtual appliance with the Drift Orchestrator.
    *   `CreateWorkflow(workflow_definition)` – Creates a new workflow based on a DAG.
    *   `ExecuteWorkflow(workflow_id, input_data)` – Executes a workflow, initiating the appliance chain.
    *   `GetCredentialHistory(workflow_id)` – Retrieves the credential drift history for a given workflow.
    *   `ModifyCredentials(current_credentials, modification_rules)` – API called by an appliance to modify credentials.  Drift Orchestrator validates the modification.

**Pseudocode (Drift Orchestrator - ExecuteWorkflow):**

```
function ExecuteWorkflow(workflow_id, input_data):
  workflow = GetWorkflow(workflow_id)
  initial_credentials = ObtainCredentials()  // As in the base patent

  current_credentials = initial_credentials
  current_data = input_data

  for appliance in workflow.appliance_chain:
    // Attach credential container to appliance’s virtual machine
    AttachCredentialContainer(appliance.vm, current_credentials)

    // Invoke appliance with data
    processed_data = InvokeAppliance(appliance.vm, current_data)

    // Obtain modified credentials from appliance
    modification_rules = GetModificationRules(appliance.vm) //Appliance provides rule set for refinement

    // Validate modification rules
    if ValidateModificationRules(modification_rules):
      current_credentials = ModifyCredentials(current_credentials, modification_rules)
      LogCredentialModification(current_credentials)
    else:
      //Error: Modification Rules Invalid
      return Error

    current_data = processed_data

  return current_data
```

**Example Workflow:**

1.  **Appliance 1 (Data Masking):** Receives raw customer data. Masks sensitive fields.  Modifies credentials to restrict access to the original, unmasked data.
2.  **Appliance 2 (Sentiment Analysis):** Receives masked data. Performs sentiment analysis.  Adds an attestation to the credentials confirming the data has been masked.
3.  **Appliance 3 (Reporting):** Receives analyzed data with attestation. Generates reports.  Credentials are further restricted to only allow report generation.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Minimizes the attack surface by limiting credentials at each step.
*   **Granular Control:** Enables fine-grained access control based on data processing stages.
*   **Auditability:** Provides a complete history of credential modifications.
*   **Automation:** Automates complex data processing workflows.
