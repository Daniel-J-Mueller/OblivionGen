## Modular Haptic Feedback System – Temple Integration

**Concept:** Integrate localized haptic feedback directly into the temples of the wearable device, using micro-actuators and a network of flexible sensors to simulate textures, impacts, and directional forces. This goes beyond simple vibration and aims for more nuanced, realistic sensory input.

**Specifications:**

*   **Actuator Type:** Piezoelectric micro-actuators arranged in a 3x3 grid within each temple. Each actuator capable of independent control of amplitude and frequency. Target actuator size: 2mm x 2mm x 1mm.
*   **Sensor Network:** Array of capacitive pressure sensors (approximately 1mm diameter) embedded within the temple padding, covering the contact area with the user’s skin. Density: 1 sensor per 5mm². Sensors to measure both static pressure and dynamic force.
*   **Temple Module Design:** Temples designed as modular units. The core structural component will accept interchangeable "sensory shells" containing the actuator/sensor network. Different shell configurations can be swapped to tailor haptic feedback intensity and area.
*   **Power/Data Interface:** Low-voltage DC power supply for actuators (3.3V). Data transmission via a high-speed serial interface (SPI or I2C) connecting to a central processing unit within the device.
*   **Software Control:** API for developers to define haptic patterns, intensity, and spatial distribution of feedback.  Support for procedural generation of haptic textures and effects.  Realtime processing of sensor data to enable adaptive haptic responses.
*   **Material Considerations:** Flexible and biocompatible materials for all components in contact with the skin (e.g., silicone, TPU). Durable and lightweight materials for the structural components (e.g., carbon fiber reinforced polymer).
*   **Data Processing Unit Requirements**: Dedicated co-processor integrated into the device to handle haptic data processing and control. Minimum specifications: ARM Cortex-M7 processor, 256KB SRAM, 1MB Flash Memory.
*   **Calibration Routine**: Automated calibration routine to adjust actuator and sensor parameters based on individual user physiology and skin properties.
*   **Adaptive Algorithms**: Algorithms to compensate for varying skin hydration levels, temperature, and pressure.
*   **Pseudocode – Haptic Texture Generation:**

```
function generateHapticTexture(textureMap, scaleFactor) {
  for (each pixel in textureMap) {
    intensity = pixel.brightness * scaleFactor;
    actuatorIndex = mapPixelToActuator(pixel.coordinates);
    setActuatorIntensity(actuatorIndex, intensity);
  }
}

function mapPixelToActuator(pixelCoordinates) {
  // Calculate corresponding actuator index based on pixel coordinates
  // Consider actuator grid dimensions and spacing
  return actuatorIndex;
}

function setActuatorIntensity(actuatorIndex, intensity) {
  // Send command to actuator driver to set intensity level
  // Ensure intensity value is within valid range
}
```

*   **Potential Applications**: Virtual reality/augmented reality interfaces, gaming, assistive technology for visually impaired individuals, medical simulations, communication devices for deaf/hard-of-hearing individuals.
