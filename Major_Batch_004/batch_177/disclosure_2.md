## Secure Multi-Party Computation with Federated Learning Integration

**Concept:** Extend the secure join protocol to incorporate federated learning techniques, enabling collaborative data analysis *without* directly sharing raw data between parties. This creates a system where multiple entities can benefit from combined datasets for complex queries and model training, all while maintaining a high degree of privacy and security.

**Specs:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Participants:** Multiple data owners (e.g., hospitals, banks, retailers) each possessing encrypted datasets.
*   **Coordinator:** A trusted (or consortium-managed) entity responsible for orchestrating the federated learning and secure join processes. This doesn't *need* decryption access, primarily managing communication and aggregation.
*   **Compute Servers (A & B):**  Similar to the original patent, two servers are required for the secure join, but now also capable of performing federated learning operations. Server A handles the initial homomorphic computations and server B decrypts partial results.
*   **Client:** An entity submitting the query, potentially benefiting from the aggregated insights.

**2. Data Preparation & Encryption:**

*   Each data owner encrypts their data using a homomorphic encryption scheme (e.g., Paillier) *and* prepares it for federated learning by representing it as feature vectors.
*   Data owners locally train a *small* model (e.g., a single layer perceptron) on their encrypted data to create initial model weights. These weights are also encrypted.

**3. Federated Learning & Secure Join Process:**

1.  **Weight Sharing:** Data owners send their encrypted model weights to the coordinator.
2.  **Aggregated Weight Calculation:** The coordinator aggregates the weights (using a secure aggregation protocol, potentially homomorphic summation) and distributes the aggregated encrypted weights to Compute Server A.
3.  **Query Processing:** The client submits a query that requires joining data from multiple sources.  The query is transformed into a set of join conditions and feature requests.
4.  **Secure Join with Feature Extraction:** Compute Server A performs a homomorphic join operation on encrypted data from different sources, *concurrently* extracting relevant features (determined by the query) from the joined records. This utilizes the pre-trained weights (received via the coordinator) to focus on meaningful feature combinations. The result is an encrypted join indicator *and* encrypted feature vectors.
5.  **Decryption & Feature Aggregation:** Compute Server B decrypts the join indicator and encrypted feature vectors.
6.  **Local Model Training & Refinement:** The decrypted feature vectors are used to train a *local* model on Compute Server B. The weights of this local model are sent back to the coordinator. This process can be iterated multiple times.
7.  **Result Delivery:** The coordinator delivers the final model to the client, or the client receives aggregated insights derived from the model.

**4. Pseudocode (Compute Server A - Key Steps):**

```pseudocode
function secure_join_and_feature_extract(encrypted_data_sources, query, global_weights):
    encrypted_join_indicators = []
    encrypted_feature_vectors = []

    for data_source in encrypted_data_sources:
        for row1 in data_source:
            for row2 in data_source:  # join within/across sources

                join_indicator = homomorphic_join_condition(row1, row2, query)
                encrypted_join_indicators.append(join_indicator)

                if join_indicator == TRUE:
                    feature_vector = extract_features(row1, row2, global_weights)
                    encrypted_feature_vectors.append(feature_vector)

    return encrypted_join_indicators, encrypted_feature_vectors
```

**5.  Security Considerations:**

*   Differential Privacy: Integrate differential privacy mechanisms during feature extraction and model training to further protect individual data records.
*   Secure Aggregation:  Employ robust secure aggregation protocols to prevent malicious parties from manipulating the aggregated model weights.
*   Key Management:  Implement a secure key management system to protect the decryption key used by Compute Server B.
*   Homomorphic Encryption Scheme Selection: Choose a homomorphic encryption scheme that is appropriate for the specific query and data types.  Paillier is a good starting point, but other schemes may offer better performance or security properties.



This allows complex analysis across disparate, encrypted datasets without direct data sharing, enhancing privacy and facilitating collaboration. The integration of federated learning allows the system to adapt and improve its insights over time.
