## Adaptive Sensor Fusion & Predictive State Management - “Chameleon”

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple presence detection to create a system that *predicts* user needs based on learned behavior and environmental context, proactively adjusting device state – not just power, but functional configuration – for optimal experience.  The core idea is a dynamically weighted sensor fusion engine coupled with a short-term predictive model.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**  Existing sensors (accelerometer, microphone, camera) *plus* ambient light sensor, temperature sensor, barometric pressure sensor, and an optional low-resolution infrared proximity sensor.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Continuous, low-power sampling of all sensors.  Sampling rates are adaptive based on detected activity – minimal when idle, increased during detected movement or sound events.
*   **Sensor Fusion Engine:** A multi-layer system using a Kalman filter approach *plus* a trainable neural network. 
    *   **Layer 1 (Kalman Filter):** Handles immediate data smoothing and noise reduction for accelerometer, gyroscope, and microphone data, creating a stable ‘motion and sound’ profile.
    *   **Layer 2 (Neural Network):**  Combines outputs from Layer 1 with data from ambient sensors (light, temp, pressure, IR proximity). The network is trained on user-specific data to identify patterns associated with different activities (e.g., reading, watching video, commuting, sleeping).
*   **Predictive Model:** A short-term Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on the output of the Sensor Fusion Engine. 
    *   The RNN predicts the *next* likely device state (e.g., “user will begin watching a video in 5 seconds”, “user is likely to answer a phone call”, “user is preparing to navigate”).
    *   Prediction horizon: 5-30 seconds.
*   **State Management:**  Device transitions are *proactive*, based on RNN predictions. Examples:
    *   **Video Prediction:** If RNN predicts video playback, pre-load video streaming app, adjust screen brightness, enable Bluetooth headphones.
    *   **Call Prediction:** If RNN predicts an incoming call, increase speaker volume, initiate voice assistant.
    *   **Navigation Prediction:** If RNN predicts navigation, launch maps app, pre-download map data.
    *   **Sleep Prediction:** Dim display, enable Do Not Disturb, adjust room temperature (if integrated with smart home system).
*   **Adaptive Weighting:**  Weights assigned to each sensor input in the fusion engine are dynamically adjusted based on context. 
    *   Example:  At night, the microphone becomes less important; the accelerometer and ambient light sensor become more important.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  All data processing occurs on-device.  User data is not uploaded to the cloud without explicit consent.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
sensors = [accelerometer, microphone, light, temp, pressure, IRproximity]
fusionEngine = initializeKalmanFilter()
predictionModel = initializeRNN()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    sensorData = readAllSensors(sensors)
    smoothedData = fusionEngine.processData(sensorData)
    predictedState = predictionModel.predictNextState(smoothedData)

    // Adjust Device State
    if (predictedState == "watchingVideo") {
        preloadVideoApp()
        adjustBrightness()
        enableHeadphones()
    } else if (predictedState == "incomingCall") {
        increaseVolume()
        activateVoiceAssistant()
    } else if (predictedState == "navigating") {
        launchMapsApp()
        downloadMapData()
    } else if (predictedState == "sleeping") {
        dimDisplay()
        enableDoNotDisturb()
        adjustRoomTemperature()
    }

    // Adaptive Weighting (example)
    if (timeIsNight()) {
        fusionEngine.setSensorWeights(accelerometer=0.7, microphone=0.1, light=0.2)
    }
}
```

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond *reactive* presence detection to *proactive* state management based on short-term prediction, optimizing the user experience before the user even explicitly interacts with the device. It leverages a broad sensor suite and adaptive weighting to achieve higher prediction accuracy and relevance.
