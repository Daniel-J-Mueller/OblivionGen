## Adaptive Haptic Feedback Profiles Linked to Accessory & Operation Mode

**Concept:** Expand upon the accessory-triggered operation mode shift by introducing dynamically adjustable haptic feedback profiles tailored to both the detected accessory *and* the current operation mode. This moves beyond visual UI changes to incorporate tactile cues, enhancing user awareness and streamlining interaction.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Enhanced Haptic Engine:** The device must feature a high-fidelity haptic engine capable of producing a wide range of nuanced vibrations, textures, and intensities.  Linear resonant actuators (LRAs) or ultrasonic haptics are preferred over eccentric rotating mass (ERM) motors for greater precision.
*   **Accessory Identification Module:**  The existing accessory detection system (likely via USB-PD, Bluetooth, or physical connection) must be extended to provide detailed accessory *type* information to the software layer.
*   **Proximity Sensors (Optional):** Integration of proximity sensors could allow for anticipatory haptic feedback based on predicted user actions (e.g., a subtle pulse as the user’s finger approaches the screen).

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Haptic Profile Database:** A database storing pre-defined haptic profiles. Each profile is associated with:
    *   Accessory Type (e.g., charging dock, headphones, car mount, game controller).
    *   Operation Mode (e.g., locked/voice-forward, standard application mode, media playback, gaming).
    *   Event Triggers (e.g., incoming call, notification, button press, screen interaction, accelerometer data).
    *   Haptic Waveform Parameters (frequency, amplitude, duration, shape, texture).
*   **Accessory & Mode Detection Module:**  This module receives input from the accessory identification hardware and the operation mode manager.  It uses this information to select the appropriate haptic profile.
*   **Haptic Engine Control Module:**  This module translates the selected haptic profile into control signals for the haptic engine. It should support real-time adjustments of haptic parameters based on user input or system events.
*   **User Customization Interface:**  A settings menu allowing users to customize haptic feedback preferences, create custom profiles, and adjust the intensity of haptic effects.

**3. Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// On Accessory Connect/Disconnect
function onAccessoryChange(accessoryType) {
  currentAccessory = accessoryType;
  updateHapticProfile();
}

// On Operation Mode Change
function onOperationModeChange(mode) {
  currentMode = mode;
  updateHapticProfile();
}

function updateHapticProfile() {
  profile = getHapticProfile(currentAccessory, currentMode);
  // If no specific profile found, use a default.
  if (profile == null) {
    profile = getDefaultHapticProfile();
  }

  // Apply the profile to the haptic engine.
  setHapticEngineProfile(profile);
}

// Example Event Trigger: Incoming Notification
function onNotificationReceived(notificationData) {
  hapticPattern = getHapticPatternForNotification(notificationData);
  playHapticPattern(hapticPattern);
}

// Haptic pattern could be:
// - Short pulse for low-priority notifications
// - Rhythmic vibration for reminders
// - Distinct pattern for specific app notifications
```

**4. Use Case Examples:**

*   **Charging Dock:** When placed on a charging dock, the device activates a “pulse” haptic effect, indicating a secure connection and the start of charging. A different pattern could indicate fast charging.
*   **Headphones Connected:** Connection triggers a “confirmation” haptic, and subsequent audio playback uses subtle vibrations synchronized with the beat.
*   **Voice-Forward Mode:**  Subtle, rhythmic vibrations confirm voice command reception and processing.
*   **Car Mount:** Detects car mount connection and activates a “steady” haptic indicating secure mounting. The vibration could subtly increase when navigation directions are spoken.
*    **Gaming Controller:** Haptic effects synchronized to in-game actions.
