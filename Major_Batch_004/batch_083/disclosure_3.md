## Adaptive Environmental Response System

**Concept:** Extend the USB dongle's functionality beyond doorbell alerts to create a localized environmental response system. Leverage the USB power and communication link to control smart home devices based on alert type *and* environmental sensor data.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Core Module:** Existing USB Dongle architecture (Processor, Memory, Communication Module).
*   **Environmental Sensor Suite:** Integrated into the dongle housing:
    *   Temperature Sensor (Range: -20°C to 60°C, Accuracy: ±0.5°C).
    *   Humidity Sensor (Range: 0-100% RH, Accuracy: ±3% RH).
    *   Ambient Light Sensor (Range: 0-100,000 Lux).
    *   Air Quality Sensor (PM2.5, TVOC detection).
*   **Wireless Communication:**
    *   Zigbee/Z-Wave Module: For direct communication with smart home devices.
    *   Bluetooth 5.0: For configuration and data logging to a mobile app.
*   **Power:** USB-powered (5V, 500mA max).
*   **Housing:** Durable plastic with ventilation for sensors.

**Software Specifications:**

1.  **Alert Processing:**
    *   Receive doorbell alert signals (as in the original patent).
    *   Decode alert type (button press, motion detection, etc.).

2.  **Sensor Data Acquisition:**
    *   Continuously read data from the environmental sensors.
    *   Data logging and transmission to a local server or cloud.

3.  **Rule Engine:**
    *   User-configurable rules based on:
        *   Alert Type
        *   Sensor Data (Temperature, Humidity, Light, Air Quality)
        *   Time of Day
    *   Example Rules:
        *   “If Doorbell Press AND Temperature < 10°C THEN activate smart thermostat to 20°C.”
        *   “If Motion Detected at Doorbell AND Air Quality = Poor THEN activate air purifier.”
        *   “If Doorbell Press AND Time = Night THEN turn on porch light and interior hallway light.”

4.  **Device Control:**
    *   Zigbee/Z-Wave commands to control:
        *   Smart Thermostats
        *   Smart Lights
        *   Smart Locks
        *   Air Purifiers
        *   Other compatible devices.

5.  **Mobile Application:**
    *   Device configuration and setup.
    *   Rule creation and management.
    *   Sensor data visualization.
    *   Remote control of connected devices.

**Pseudocode (Rule Engine):**

```
FUNCTION evaluate_rule(alert_type, temperature, humidity, light_level, air_quality, time_of_day, rule) {
  IF rule.condition_alert_type == alert_type AND
     rule.condition_temperature_min <= temperature AND
     rule.condition_temperature_max >= temperature AND
     rule.condition_humidity_min <= humidity AND
     rule.condition_humidity_max >= humidity AND
     rule.condition_light_level_min <= light_level AND
     rule.condition_light_level_max >= light_level AND
     rule.condition_air_quality == air_quality AND
     rule.condition_time_of_day == time_of_day THEN {
    execute_action(rule.action_type, rule.action_parameter);
  }
}
```

**Expansion Potential:** Integration with IFTTT or other automation platforms for expanded device compatibility and rule complexity. Voice control via integration with Alexa or Google Assistant.
