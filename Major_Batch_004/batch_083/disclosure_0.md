## Adaptive Session Entropy

**Concept:** Dynamically modulate the complexity of the session token itself – not just the values within it – based on observed session behavior and threat modeling.

**Specification:**

1.  **Entropy Profile Generation:** A server-side module maintains entropy profiles for different session risk levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical). Each profile defines:
    *   `Token Field Count`: Number of data fields within the session token.
    *   `Field Encryption Depth`: Level of encryption applied to each field (None, Symmetric, Asymmetric).
    *   `Field Data Type Variety`: Number of distinct data types used within fields (Integer, String, Boolean, Array).
    *   `Token Padding Length`: Amount of random padding added to the token to increase its size.
    *   `Redundancy Factor`: Number of redundant, but cryptographically sound, fields.

2.  **Session Risk Assessment:** Continuously analyze session activity (request frequency, operation types, data accessed, geographic location, device fingerprint) to assign a real-time risk score. Machine learning models (trained on historical attack data) can be leveraged here.

3.  **Dynamic Token Construction:** When issuing a new session token or updating an existing one, the server dynamically constructs the token based on the session’s current risk score:
    *   Low Risk: Minimal fields, no encryption, simple data types.
    *   Medium Risk: Increased field count, symmetric encryption for sensitive data, mixed data types.
    *   High Risk: Significant field count, asymmetric encryption for critical data, diverse data types, substantial padding.
    *   Critical Risk: Maximal field count, multi-layered encryption, complex data structures, significant padding, redundant fields.

4.  **Client-Side Validation:** The client (browser/app) must be capable of parsing and validating the dynamically constructed token. The validation process verifies:
    *   Token structure conforms to the expected format.
    *   Encryption keys are valid.
    *   Data types are consistent.

5.  **Adaptive Challenge:**  If token validation fails, the client is presented with an adaptive challenge (e.g., multi-factor authentication, CAPTCHA).  Challenge severity is proportional to the degree of token corruption and the session's risk score.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side – Token Generation)**

```
function generateSessionToken(sessionId, riskScore, initialData) {
  profile = selectEntropyProfile(riskScore);

  token = {};
  token.sessionId = sessionId;
  token.timestamp = currentTime();

  // Add data fields based on profile
  for (i = 0; i < profile.fieldCount; i++) {
    fieldKey = "field_" + i;
    fieldType = randomSelect(profile.fieldTypes);
    if (fieldType == "encrypted") {
      token[fieldKey] = encrypt(generateRandomData(), profile.encryptionKey);
    } else {
      token[fieldKey] = generateRandomData();
    }
  }

  // Add padding
  token.padding = generateRandomString(profile.paddingLength);

  // Sign the token
  signedToken = signToken(token, profile.signingKey);
  return signedToken;
}
```

**Engineer Deliverables:**

*   Server-side module for risk assessment and dynamic token construction.
*   Client-side library for token parsing, validation, and adaptive challenge handling.
*   API for integration with existing authentication and authorization systems.
*   Robust key management system.
*   Monitoring and logging infrastructure to track token entropy levels and potential attacks.
