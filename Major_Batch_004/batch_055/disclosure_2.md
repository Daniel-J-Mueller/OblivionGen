## Dynamic Content Segmentation via Predictive Behavioral Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the proxy server’s ability to route traffic based not only on URL patterns, but also on *predicted* user behavior and content type, dynamically adjusting security levels *during* a session. This moves beyond static ‘secured’ vs. ‘unsecured’ partitioning.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profile Module:**

*   **Data Collection:**  Monitor user interaction data via the proxy: request frequency, time spent on page, data volume transferred, client device type, geographic location, referrer URL. *Do not store Personally Identifiable Information (PII)*.  Hash/anonymize data aggressively.
*   **Machine Learning Model:** Train a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, an LSTM – to predict user intent and content type.  Inputs: historical user behavior (anonymized), current session data. Outputs: probability scores for defined “risk profiles” (e.g., "browsing," "transaction," "data upload," "API access").  The model *must* allow for online learning – adapting in real-time to changing behavior.
*   **Risk Thresholds:**  Define configurable thresholds for each risk profile.  Crossing a threshold triggers a change in routing policy.

**2. Dynamic Routing Policy Engine:**

*   **Baseline Policy:** Initial routing determined by URL patterns (as in the base patent).
*   **Behavioral Override:**  During a session, the Behavioral Profile Module’s output overrides the baseline policy *if* a risk profile’s probability exceeds its threshold.
*   **Granular Routing:** Implement the following routing options:
    *   **Standard (Unsecured):**  Traffic routed to the customer-managed server (untrusted network).
    *   **Secure (Firewalled):** Traffic routed via the organization's firewall to a secure server.
    *   **Isolated (Sandboxed):**  Traffic routed to a fully isolated virtual machine or container for deep inspection (e.g., malware analysis).
    *   **Rate Limited:** Limit bandwidth or request frequency.
*   **Adaptive Firewall Rules:**  Dynamically adjust firewall rules based on the chosen routing option.

**3.  Content Type Inference Engine:**

*   **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** Analyze packet payloads (within privacy constraints) to infer content type (e.g., images, videos, documents, API calls).
*   **Content-Aware Routing:** Combine content type with behavioral analysis.  Example: high probability of “data upload” *and* detection of a document file -> route to a secure sandboxed environment for scanning.

**4. Pseudocode (Routing Decision):**

```
FUNCTION determine_route(request):
  baseline_route = get_baseline_route(request.url)
  behavioral_profile = analyze_behavior(request.user_session)
  content_type = infer_content_type(request.payload)

  IF behavioral_profile.risk_score["transaction"] > TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD AND content_type == "credit_card_data":
    route = SECURE
  ELSE IF behavioral_profile.risk_score["upload"] > UPLOAD_THRESHOLD AND content_type == "executable":
    route = ISOLATED
  ELSE IF behavioral_profile.risk_score["api_access"] > API_THRESHOLD:
    route = RATE_LIMITED
  ELSE:
    route = baseline_route

  RETURN route
```

**5. System Components:**

*   **Proxy Server Module (Base Patent):** Extended to integrate with Behavioral Profile Module and Dynamic Routing Policy Engine.
*   **Behavioral Analysis Service:**  Dedicated service for training and running the ML model.
*   **Content Inspection Service:**  Service for DPI and malware analysis.
*   **Policy Management Interface:**  Web interface for configuring risk thresholds, routing rules, and ML model parameters.
