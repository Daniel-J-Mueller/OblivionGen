## Adaptive Task "Swarming" & Skill Synthesis

**Concept:** Extend the idea of pre-allocating tasks to performer nodes, not just based on affinity, but by dynamically synthesizing skills across those nodes to tackle *complex* tasks that no single performer could handle. This goes beyond simple task division; it's about assembling temporary, specialized "swarms" of performers.

**Specifications:**

**1. Skill Graph Construction:**

*   **Data Source:**  Analyze historical task performance data (from the existing system) to build a skill graph. Nodes represent individual task performer users. Edges represent demonstrated skills (e.g., 'data entry', 'image labeling', ‘python scripting’, 'sentiment analysis'). Edge weight represents proficiency (derived from task completion rate, accuracy, speed, and requester approval).
*   **Skill Extraction:** Employ NLP on task descriptions and user-submitted “about me” information to automatically identify and tag skills.  Machine learning models should be trained to handle synonymy and nuanced skill descriptions.
*   **Skill Decay:**  Implement a ‘decay’ function for skills.  Skills not actively used over a defined period gradually lose weight in the graph. This keeps the graph current with performers’ evolving capabilities.

**2. Complex Task Decomposition & Skill Requirement Analysis:**

*   **Task Input:** When a complex task is submitted, a dedicated module analyzes it to decompose it into smaller sub-tasks.
*   **Skill Mapping:** For each sub-task, the module identifies the required skills (using NLP and a knowledge base).  A 'skill requirement vector' is created for each sub-task, detailing the necessary skills and proficiency levels.
*   **Dependency Graph:** A dependency graph is constructed, showing the order in which sub-tasks must be completed and the data flow between them.

**3. Dynamic Swarm Formation:**

*   **Node Selection:**  The system searches the skill graph for performer nodes that collectively possess the skills required to complete the task’s sub-tasks.  Optimization criteria:
    *   **Skill Coverage:** Prioritize nodes that cover the *entire* skill requirement vector.
    *   **Proximity:** Favor nodes within the same computing node to minimize communication latency.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Distribute tasks evenly across available nodes.
    *   **Cost:** Factor in performer compensation rates.
*   **Temporary Swarm Creation:** A temporary "swarm" of performer nodes is created, with each node assigned a subset of the sub-tasks.
*   **Role Assignment:**  Within the swarm, performers are assigned specific roles based on their skills and experience.

**4. Collaborative Task Execution & Real-time Adaptation:**

*   **Communication Protocol:** A secure, real-time communication protocol (e.g., WebSockets) is established between swarm members.
*   **Data Sharing:**  A shared data repository (e.g., cloud storage) is used to store intermediate results and ensure data consistency.
*   **Monitoring & Adaptation:**  The system continuously monitors swarm performance (task completion rate, error rate, communication latency).
    *   If a performer fails or becomes unavailable, the system automatically reassigns tasks to other swarm members.
    *   If the task requirements change, the system dynamically adjusts the swarm composition and role assignments.
*   **Collective Intelligence:** Implement a simple consensus mechanism for ambiguous tasks. Swarm members vote on the best approach, promoting collective intelligence.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Formation):**

```
function formSwarm(complexTask) {
  subTasks = decomposeTask(complexTask);
  skillRequirements = analyzeSubTasks(subTasks);
  candidateNodes = findNodes(skillRequirements);
  swarm = selectNodes(candidateNodes, optimizationCriteria); // Optimization: coverage, load, cost
  assignRoles(swarm, subTasks);
  return swarm;
}
```

**Scalability:** The system must be designed to handle a large number of tasks and performers.  Consider using distributed computing techniques and message queues to improve scalability and reliability.
