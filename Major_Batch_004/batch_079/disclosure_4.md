## Actor System Resource Prediction & Pre-Migration

**Concept:** Expand the reactive actor movement concept to *predict* resource contention and proactively migrate actors *before* performance degradation occurs. This moves beyond simply reacting to high message frequency to anticipating future needs.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Collection & Modeling:**

*   **Metrics:** Collect the following metrics per actor:
    *   Message frequency (as in the original patent) – To/From all other actors.
    *   Message size distribution – Track message sizes to predict bandwidth needs.
    *   CPU utilization – Measure CPU usage of the actor’s current host server.
    *   Memory utilization – Measure memory usage of the actor’s current host server.
    *   Actor state size – Estimate the memory footprint of the actor’s internal state.
    *   Dependency graph – Map out all actors this actor directly interacts with.
*   **Historical Data Storage:** Store collected metrics in a time-series database (e.g., Prometheus, InfluxDB).  Retain data for at least 30 days.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM neural network, ARIMA) to predict future resource utilization based on historical data. Separate models should exist per metric (CPU, memory, message frequency, etc.).
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., standard deviation thresholds, isolation forests) to identify unusual patterns in resource usage.

**2. Proactive Migration Logic:**

*   **Prediction Thresholds:** Define thresholds for predicted resource utilization (e.g., “If predicted CPU utilization exceeds 80% within the next 5 minutes…”).
*   **Migration Candidate Selection:** When prediction thresholds are met, identify actors as potential migration candidates. Prioritize actors with high dependency graphs (migrating these consolidates resources).
*   **Resource Availability Assessment:** Before migration, evaluate resource availability on other servers in the actor system. Consider:
    *   CPU availability
    *   Memory availability
    *   Network bandwidth
    *   Proximity to frequently communicated-with actors (latency consideration)
*   **Cost Function:**  A cost function will score each potential server for migration based on a weighted combination of:
    *   Resource availability score
    *   Network latency score (based on inter-actor message frequency)
    *   Migration overhead score (estimated time/resources to migrate actor state)
*   **Migration Initiation:** Initiate actor migration to the server with the lowest cost function score. Implement a phased migration strategy.
    *   **Phase 1: State Replication:** Replicate the actor's state to the target server.
    *   **Phase 2: Traffic Redirection:** Gradually redirect incoming messages to the replicated actor on the target server.
    *   **Phase 3: Decommissioning:** Decommission the actor on the original server.

**3.  Self-Adaptive Thresholds:**

*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Implement a feedback loop to dynamically adjust prediction thresholds based on observed system performance. If false positives (unnecessary migrations) are frequent, raise the thresholds. If performance degradation occurs *before* the prediction triggers, lower the thresholds.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Explore the use of reinforcement learning to optimize threshold values and migration strategies over time. Reward successful migrations and penalize unsuccessful ones.

**Pseudocode (Migration Trigger):**

```
function check_migration_trigger(actor):
  predicted_cpu = predict_cpu_utilization(actor, 5_minutes)
  predicted_memory = predict_memory_utilization(actor, 5_minutes)
  current_cpu = get_cpu_utilization(actor.server)
  current_memory = get_memory_utilization(actor.server)

  if predicted_cpu > 80% or predicted_memory > 80%:
    candidate_servers = find_candidate_servers(actor)
    best_server = select_best_server(actor, candidate_servers)

    if best_server != null:
      initiate_migration(actor, best_server)
```
