## Dynamic DNS with Predictive Health & Automated Rollback

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple health checks to *predictive* health monitoring, coupled with automated DNS rollback to previous healthy states. This adds a proactive layer to the existing rule-based DNS system, minimizing downtime due to service degradation *before* a full outage occurs.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Health Module:**

*   **Data Collection:** Integrate with existing monitoring systems (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network latency, application-specific metrics – e.g., queue lengths, error rates).  Extend data collection to *rate of change* of these metrics (derivatives).
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Employ time-series anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Prophet, LSTM autoencoders) to establish baseline behavior for each service.  These models learn expected metric ranges and deviations.
*   **Prediction Engine:** Use the anomaly detection models to *predict* potential service degradation.  For example, if CPU utilization is rapidly increasing and approaching a threshold, predict a future performance bottleneck.
*   **Scoring System:** Assign a “Health Score” to each service based on the prediction engine’s output.  The score represents the likelihood of future impairment.

**2. DNS Rollback Mechanism:**

*   **Historical DNS Record Storage:** Maintain a history of DNS records for each service, indexed by timestamp.  This is a rolling window, configurable in duration (e.g., 7 days, 30 days).
*   **Rollback Threshold:** Configure a “Rollback Threshold” for each service, based on the Health Score.  When the Health Score falls below this threshold, initiate the rollback process.
*   **Automated Rollback:** When triggered, the system automatically:
    1.  Identifies the most recent healthy DNS record (based on Health Score at the time of record creation).
    2.  Updates the DNS records to point to the IP address(es) associated with the healthy record.
    3.  Logs the rollback event.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:**  Continuously monitor the service after rollback to confirm restoration of health.  Alert administrators if the rollback is unsuccessful.

**3. Rule Integration:**

*   **Rule Enhancement:** Extend the existing DNS rule system to include parameters for:
    *   Predictive Health Monitoring: Enable/disable predictive health for a specific rule.
    *   Rollback Threshold: Define the Health Score threshold that triggers a rollback.
    *   Rollback Window: Specify the duration of the historical DNS record window to search for healthy records.
*   **Dynamic Rule Updates:** Allow administrators to dynamically adjust the rollback threshold and window without restarting the DNS resolution system.

**Pseudocode (Rollback Logic):**

```
function rollbackDNS(serviceName):
  historicalRecords = getHistoricalDNSRecords(serviceName)
  sortedRecords = sortRecordsByHealthScore(historicalRecords, descending=True)

  for record in sortedRecords:
    if record.healthScore >= rollbackThreshold:
      updateDNS(serviceName, record.ipAddress)
      logRollbackEvent(serviceName, record.timestamp)
      return True # Rollback successful

  logRollbackFailure(serviceName)
  return False # Rollback failed – no healthy records found
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `DNS Record`: `serviceName`, `timestamp`, `ipAddress`, `healthScore`

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   A/B testing of DNS rollbacks – gradually shift traffic back to the potentially degraded service to validate recovery.
*   Integration with auto-scaling systems to automatically provision new instances in case of widespread failures.
*   Machine learning to automatically tune the rollback threshold and window based on service performance.
