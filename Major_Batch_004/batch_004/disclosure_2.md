## Dynamic Request Shadowing & Predictive Defect Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the existing request-to-code mapping by dynamically “shadowing” requests in a staging/test environment and *predictively* identifying potential defects *before* they manifest in production. This moves beyond simple mapping to proactive risk mitigation.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Request Interceptor & Shadow Generator:**
    *   Intercepts all HTTP requests in a designated staging/test environment.
    *   Creates a “shadow” request – an identical request routed to a parallel, instrumented instance of the application.
    *   Instrumentation includes detailed logging of execution paths, variable states, and resource usage.
    *   Shadow requests *do not* affect the primary application or user experience.
*   **Component 2: Execution Path Profiler:**
    *   Analyzes the execution path of each shadow request.
    *   Builds a detailed profile of code sections executed, functions called, and data accessed.
    *   Profiles are timestamped and associated with the original request parameters.
*   **Component 3: Anomaly Detection Engine:**
    *   Employs machine learning models trained on “normal” execution profiles.
    *   Detects anomalies in shadow request profiles – unexpected code execution, unusual resource consumption, or significant deviations from baseline behavior.
    *   Anomaly scores are assigned to each shadow request.
*   **Component 4: Predictive Defect Reporter:**
    *   Aggregates anomaly scores and associated execution data.
    *   Prioritizes potential defects based on severity and likelihood.
    *   Provides developers with detailed reports, including:
        *   Request parameters that triggered the anomaly.
        *   Affected code sections (with line numbers).
        *   Execution trace leading to the anomaly.
        *   Suggested remediation steps.
*   **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   The existing code indexing system is used to map request parameters to code locations.
    *   The anomaly detection engine leverages this mapping to provide context-specific defect reports.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Engine):**

```
function detect_anomaly(execution_profile, code_mapping):
    # Load baseline execution profiles for similar requests
    baseline_profiles = load_baseline(execution_profile)

    # Calculate anomaly score based on deviation from baseline
    anomaly_score = calculate_deviation(execution_profile, baseline_profiles)

    # If anomaly score exceeds threshold:
    if anomaly_score > threshold:
        # Identify affected code sections using code_mapping
        affected_code = code_mapping.get_code_from_request(execution_profile)

        # Generate detailed defect report
        report = generate_defect_report(execution_profile, affected_code, anomaly_score)

        return report
    else:
        return None
```

**Novelty:** This shifts the focus from *reactive* debugging to *proactive* defect prevention. It allows developers to identify and fix potential issues before they impact users. The predictive aspect, enabled by machine learning and dynamic request shadowing, is the key innovation. It’s about predicting where things *will* break, not just understanding why they *did* break.
