## Multi-Dimensional Audio Scene Reconstruction & Personalized Spatial Audio

**Concept:** Extend synchronized multi-device audio beyond simple content replication to reconstruct a 3D audio scene, dynamically adapting to user position and preferences.  The system creates a localized 'sound field' that isn't tied to physical speaker locations.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:**  ‘Acoustic Mesh Generator’ - Software module creating a dynamically updating spatial audio representation. This mesh isn't a visual construct, but a data structure representing sound source positions, sound propagation characteristics, and listener location.
*   **Device Roles:**
    *   **Anchor Devices:**  Devices with known physical positions (e.g., smart speakers, displays).  These transmit base audio streams and positioning data.
    *   **Transient Devices:**  Mobile devices (phones, tablets, headphones) that dynamically join/leave the audio ‘mesh’. They contribute localized sound rendering and user preference data.
    *   **Processing Hub:** Cloud or local server responsible for the Acoustic Mesh Generator and distributing optimized audio streams to devices.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   **Anchor Device Audio:**  Raw audio streams and location data from anchor devices.
    *   **Transient Device Audio:** Audio originating directly from transient devices (e.g., a phone call) or relayed audio from external sources.
    *   **User Location Data:**  Real-time location tracking of users (via device sensors, or external positioning systems).
    *   **User Preference Data:** User-defined spatial audio settings (e.g., preferred reverb, equalization, sound source prioritization)
*   **Processing Steps:**
    1.  **Scene Mapping:**  The Processing Hub builds the Acoustic Mesh based on anchor device locations and detected sound sources.
    2.  **User Localization:** User location is determined and incorporated into the mesh.
    3.  **Audio Decomposition:**  Each sound source's audio is deconstructed into directional components.
    4.  **Spatial Rendering:** The directional components are rendered, applying HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) filtering and reverb based on user location and preferences.
    5.  **Stream Optimization:** Optimized audio streams are generated for each device, containing only the spatialized components that device is responsible for rendering. This minimizes bandwidth and processing load.
    6.  **Dynamic Adaptation:**  The mesh is continuously updated based on user movement, device additions/removals, and changes in the sound environment.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On Processing Hub:

function UpdateAcousticMesh(anchorDevices, transientDevices, userLocations, userPreferences):
  mesh = CreateEmptyMesh()

  // Add Anchor Devices to Mesh
  for each anchorDevice in anchorDevices:
    AddDeviceToMesh(mesh, anchorDevice.position, anchorDevice.audioStream)

  // Add Transient Devices to Mesh
  for each transientDevice in transientDevices:
    AddDeviceToMesh(mesh, transientDevice.position, transientDevice.audioStream)

  // Adjust Mesh based on User Location and Preferences
  for each user in userLocations:
    ApplyUserPreferences(mesh, user.preferences, user.location)

  return mesh

function ApplyUserPreferences(mesh, preferences, location):
  //Apply individual preferences to each sound source
  //Adjust reverb, equalization, volume, panning based on preferences and location
  //Prioritize sound sources based on user preference
  //Calculate HRTF filters based on user location and head orientation

function GenerateOptimizedAudioStreams(mesh, deviceList):
  for each device in deviceList:
    stream = CreateEmptyAudioStream()
    //Determine which sound sources the device is responsible for rendering
    //Spatializes sound sources based on HRTF filters and device position
    //Adds spatialized sound sources to the audio stream
    return stream

// On each Device:
function PlayAudioStream(stream):
  //Decodes audio stream
  //Renders spatialized audio using built-in audio processing capabilities
  //Plays audio through connected speakers or headphones

```

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond simple synchronization to create a truly immersive spatial audio experience that adapts to the user and their environment. Focuses on *reconstruction* of a sound field rather than simple replication, allowing for experiences beyond the limitations of fixed speaker locations. Leverages the network of devices as a distributed rendering engine.
