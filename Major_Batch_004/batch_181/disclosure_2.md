## Dynamic Device Persona Creation & Proactive Routine Suggestion

**Concept:** Extend device naming/grouping beyond simple identification. Create dynamic "personas" for devices based on learned usage *and* proactively suggest routines tailored to these personas *before* explicit user command.  This goes beyond just renaming; it's about the system *understanding* how a device is being used and anticipating needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Engine:** A core component responsible for building and maintaining device personas.
*   **Usage Data Inputs:** Beyond standard operational data (on/off times, connected services), ingest data from multiple sources:
    *   **Sensor Data:** Microphone (ambient sound analysis – “is this device used primarily during music playback?”), Camera (visual scene understanding – “is this device frequently pointed at a cooking area?”), Accelerometer (motion analysis – “is this device often moved while in use?”).
    *   **Network Data:** Connected device types (smart bulbs, streaming sticks), bandwidth usage patterns.
    *   **User Interaction Data:** Voice command history, manual control patterns.
*   **Persona Attributes:**  Each persona is defined by a set of weighted attributes. Example:
    *   "Kitchen Speaker" -  Attributes:  "Cooking" (weight 0.7), "Music" (weight 0.6), “News/Podcast” (weight 0.4), “Timer/Alarm” (weight 0.8)
    *   "Living Room Lamp" - Attributes: “Relaxation” (weight 0.9), “Movie Watching” (weight 0.7), “Reading” (weight 0.6)
*   **Routine Suggestion Engine:** Analyzes current context (time of day, day of week, user location, environmental factors) *and* active device personas.  Proposes routines based on highly probable combinations.
    *   Example:  If "Kitchen Speaker" persona is active and it’s 7:00 AM on a weekday, suggest routine: “Good Morning Routine: Play News, Read Calendar, Start Coffee Maker.”
    *   Routines are presented as non-intrusive suggestions (visual indicator on device, brief audio prompt).
*   **Proactive State Adjustment:** Based on persona and context, automatically adjust device states *before* command. (Dim Living Room Lamp if persona = "Movie Watching" and user is in the living room). This requires user-configurable sensitivity levels.
*   **Persona Overlap & Conflict Resolution:** Devices can belong to multiple personas. System must prioritize based on context and user preferences.
*   **User Feedback Loop:** Explicit user feedback on suggested routines and proactive state adjustments to refine persona models.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** All sensor data processing must be opt-in, anonymized where possible, and with clear user control.

**Pseudocode (Routine Suggestion Engine):**

```
function suggest_routine(context, device_personas):
  best_routine = null
  highest_probability = 0

  for each device in device_personas:
    routine_options = get_routine_options(device.persona) // Returns list of potential routines for that persona
    for each routine in routine_options:
      probability = calculate_routine_probability(routine, context, device.persona) // Algorithm factoring in context, persona weights, and historical success rate
      if probability > highest_probability:
        highest_probability = probability
        best_routine = routine

  if best_routine != null and highest_probability > threshold: // Threshold to avoid false positives
    display_routine_suggestion(best_routine)

  return
```
