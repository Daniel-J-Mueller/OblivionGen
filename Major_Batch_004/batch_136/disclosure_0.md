## Dynamic Path Stitching with Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of shifting traffic between primary and secondary paths, not as a reactive steering mechanism for failure or maintenance, but as a *proactive* system that anticipates network congestion and dynamically ‘stitches’ together optimal paths based on predicted load. This moves beyond simple path selection to a granular, multi-path flow management system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Load Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time network telemetry (bandwidth utilization, latency, packet loss), historical traffic patterns, application-level QoS requirements (if available).
*   **Processing:** Employ time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict bandwidth demands across network segments over a defined prediction horizon (e.g., 5-30 seconds). Incorporate machine learning models trained on historical data to anticipate congestion hotspots.
*   **Output:** A 'Load Prediction Map' indicating predicted congestion levels for various network segments and potential alternate paths.

**2. Path Stitching Engine:**

*   **Input:** Load Prediction Map, current network topology (discovered via routing protocols), available paths for each destination prefix (primary, secondary, and potentially tertiary paths), application-level requirements (if available).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Cost Function:** Define a cost function that considers bandwidth availability, latency, packet loss, and hop count. This function will be used to evaluate the suitability of different paths.
    *   **Multi-Path Flow Splitting:** For each destination prefix, determine an optimal flow splitting ratio across available paths that minimizes the overall cost function. This can be achieved through linear programming or heuristic algorithms.
    *   **Micro-Flow Steering:** Instead of steering entire flows, divide flows into micro-flows (e.g., based on source/destination ports, or using a randomized hashing scheme). Steer micro-flows across different paths based on the calculated flow splitting ratios. This provides finer-grained control and avoids large-scale flow disruptions.

**3. Dynamic Steering Route Injection:**

*   **Mechanism:** Utilize a steering route injection mechanism similar to the original patent but extend its capabilities.
*   **Granularity:** Inject steering routes that are specific to individual micro-flows, not just entire prefixes. This can be achieved through the use of MPLS labels or similar tagging mechanisms.
*   **Frequency:** Adjust steering routes dynamically based on changes in the Load Prediction Map. The update frequency should be optimized to balance responsiveness and overhead.

**4.  Feedback Loop & Learning:**

*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the performance of steered traffic (latency, packet loss) and compare it to predictions.
*   **Learning:** Use reinforcement learning techniques to refine the accuracy of the Load Prediction Map and the effectiveness of the flow splitting algorithms.
*   **Adaptive Parameters:** Automatically adjust the parameters of the cost function and the flow splitting algorithms based on feedback from the monitoring system.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Flow Splitting Algorithm):**

```
function calculate_flow_splitting_ratios(prefix, available_paths, load_prediction_map):
  // available_paths is a list of paths: [path1, path2, path3...]
  // load_prediction_map contains predicted load for each path

  path_costs = []
  for path in available_paths:
    cost = calculate_path_cost(path, load_prediction_map)  // Uses cost function
    path_costs.append(cost)

  total_cost = sum(path_costs)

  splitting_ratios = []
  for cost in path_costs:
    ratio = cost / total_cost
    splitting_ratios.append(ratio)

  return splitting_ratios

function steer_micro_flow(micro_flow, splitting_ratios, available_paths):
  // Randomly select a path based on the splitting ratios
  random_number = random()
  cumulative_probability = 0
  for i, ratio in enumerate(splitting_ratios):
    cumulative_probability += ratio
    if random_number <= cumulative_probability:
      selected_path = available_paths[i]
      break
  
  // Inject steering route for the micro-flow to direct it along the selected path
  inject_steering_route(micro_flow, selected_path)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires high-performance network devices capable of handling granular flow steering and dynamic route updates.
*   Software-defined networking (SDN) architecture can simplify the implementation and management of the system.
*   Machine learning models can be deployed on dedicated hardware accelerators for improved performance.
