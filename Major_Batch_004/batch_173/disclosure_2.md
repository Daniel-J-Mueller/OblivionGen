## Adaptive Resonance Sensor Network

**Concept:** A distributed sensor network employing multiple adjustable light sensors (based on the core adjustable housing concept) to create a dynamic, self-calibrating field of detection. This moves beyond simple object detection at a single point (like a conveyor end) toward environmental mapping and nuanced interaction.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Node:** Each node comprises the adjustable sensor housing (as per the referenced patent) coupled with a miniature microcontroller (ESP32 or similar). Each sensor will have a narrow field of view.
*   **Network Topology:** Nodes are arranged in a mesh network, communicating wirelessly (LoRaWAN, Zigbee, or custom protocol).  Power can be supplied via PoE (Power over Ethernet) or local batteries.
*   **Resonance Frequency Mapping:** Each sensor node is programmed to emit a unique, low-intensity infrared “ping”.  The network software then calculates the time-of-flight of the IR ping as it reflects off objects within the sensor field. This provides distance and relative position data.
*   **Dynamic Calibration Routine:**
    *   Each sensor cycles through its full range of adjustment (using the provided adjustable housing mechanism) while emitting its IR ping.
    *   The system analyzes the reflected IR signal at each adjustment position.
    *   The software identifies the sensor position that maximizes signal clarity and minimizes interference.
    *   This establishes the sensor's ‘optimal’ calibration point for its immediate environment.
    *   Calibration happens continuously, adapting to changes in lighting, object position, and environmental factors.
*   **Data Fusion and Environmental Mapping:**
    *   Data from all nodes is aggregated by a central server or edge computing device.
    *   Algorithms process the distance, position, and signal strength data to create a 3D map of the environment.
    *   The map identifies objects, their shapes, and their movement.
*   **Adaptive Sensitivity and Thresholds:**  Based on the environmental map, the system automatically adjusts the sensitivity and thresholds of each sensor to optimize performance. This minimizes false positives and false negatives.
*   **Interaction Modes:**
    *   **Proximity Detection:** Standard trigger for automation based on object presence.
    *   **Shape Recognition:** Identify objects based on their silhouette within the sensor field.
    *   **Gesture Control:** Detect hand movements for user interaction (e.g., wave to activate a machine).
    *   **Occlusion Handling:**  The network compensates for objects blocking the view of other sensors, utilizing data from surrounding nodes to maintain accurate environmental mapping.

**Pseudocode (Calibration Routine – Single Node):**

```
loop:
  for angle = 0 to 359: // Rotate sensor through full range
    adjustSensor(angle) // Use housing mechanism to set angle
    emitIRPing()
    receiveIRReflection()
    signalStrength = analyzeReflection()
    store(angle, signalStrength)
  end for

  bestAngle = findMax(signalStrengthData)
  adjustSensor(bestAngle)
  delay(calibrationInterval)
end loop
```
