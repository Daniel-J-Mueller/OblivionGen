## Adaptive Diagnostic “Shadowing” & Predictive Failure Analysis

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the idea of capturing service-specific diagnostic data, but extends it to *proactively* shadow user sessions and build predictive failure models. Instead of simply responding to reported issues, the system anticipates them.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Session Shadow:** When a user begins an interaction with an application, a “shadow session” is initiated. This shadow isn’t visible to the user but passively records:
    *   All API calls made by the application on behalf of the user.
    *   Resource utilization (CPU, memory, network I/O) associated with each API call.
    *   Timestamps for all operations.
    *   User interaction data (mouse movements, keystrokes – anonymized/aggregated to preserve privacy).

2.  **Anomaly Detection Engine:**  The core of the system. This engine runs in the background and continuously analyzes the data from shadow sessions. It employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks) to establish baseline behavior for each user/application combination.

3.  **Predictive Failure Model:** Based on the anomaly detection, the system builds a predictive failure model. This model identifies patterns that precede failures.  For example, a consistent increase in latency for a specific API call, coupled with a specific user interaction pattern, might indicate an impending problem.

4.  **Automated Diagnostic Probe Launch:**  When the predictive model indicates a high probability of failure, the system *automatically* launches targeted diagnostic probes. These probes aren't initiated by the user; they’re triggered by the system's prediction.  Probes can include:
    *   Detailed log collection from relevant services.
    *   Heap dumps or thread dumps.
    *   Network packet captures.
    *   Performance profiling.

5.  **“Time Capsule” Data Storage:** All shadow session data, anomaly detection results, and diagnostic probe data are stored in a “time capsule” – a historical record that can be used for post-mortem analysis and to refine the predictive models.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Anomaly Detection):**

```
// Define baseline performance metrics for API 'X' (average latency, CPU usage)
baseline_latency_X = calculate_average_latency(API_X_data)
baseline_cpu_X = calculate_average_cpu_usage(API_X_data)

// For each new API call 'X':
current_latency_X = get_latency(API_X_call)
current_cpu_X = get_cpu_usage(API_X_call)

// Calculate deviation from baseline
latency_deviation = abs(current_latency_X - baseline_latency_X) / baseline_latency_X
cpu_deviation = abs(current_cpu_X - baseline_cpu_X) / baseline_cpu_X

// Define thresholds for triggering an alert
latency_threshold = 0.2  // 20% deviation
cpu_threshold = 0.15 // 15% deviation

// If deviation exceeds threshold:
if (latency_deviation > latency_threshold) or (cpu_deviation > cpu_threshold):
    // Trigger alert and initiate diagnostic probe
    trigger_alert("High deviation detected for API X")
    launch_diagnostic_probe(API_X)
```

**User Interface Integration:**

*   A “Health Monitor” dashboard displays real-time system health and predictive risk scores.
*   Users can view historical data and diagnostic reports.
*   Users can configure alert thresholds and diagnostic probe settings.

**Data Privacy Considerations:**

*   All user interaction data is anonymized and aggregated.
*   Data retention policies are clearly defined and enforced.
*   Users have the ability to opt-out of data collection.
