## Dynamic Authentication Beacon Network

**Concept:** Expand the scope of authentication beyond the device itself, creating a localized 'trust network' using Bluetooth beacons and proximity data. This aims to preemptively identify potential theft *before* a challenge is even presented to the user, and add layers of authentication tailored to the user’s typical environment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Beacon Deployment:**

*   **Hardware:** Small, low-energy Bluetooth beacons deployed in locations frequently used by the owner (home, office, car, favorite coffee shop, etc.). These beacons should be configurable with unique IDs.
*   **Beacon Density:**  Variable, depending on location type.  Higher density in potentially sensitive areas (e.g., near frequently accessed data ports) and lower density in open areas.
*   **Owner Configuration:**  App-based interface allows the owner to “teach” the system their frequented locations by manually associating beacon IDs with those places.

**2. Device Integration:**

*   **Continuous Scanning:** The user device constantly scans for nearby Bluetooth beacons.
*   **Proximity Mapping:**  The device maintains a running map of detected beacon IDs and their relative signal strengths (RSSI).
*   **Deviation Detection:**  Algorithm monitors for deviations from the “normal” beacon map.  Deviations are categorized by severity.
    *   **Minor Deviation:** Signal strength changes suggest moving within a known location.  No action required.
    *   **Moderate Deviation:**  A known beacon is missing, or a new, unknown beacon is detected. Initiate a low-level authentication challenge (e.g., a simple PIN or biometric prompt).
    *   **Major Deviation:**  Significant shift in the beacon map, suggesting the device is in an unknown location.  Initiate a full-scale authentication sequence including the challenge mechanisms described in the provided patent *and* activation of the audible alert.

**3. Dynamic Challenge Generation:**

*   **Location-Aware Challenges:**  Challenges are tailored to the user's current location based on the beacon map. For example:
    *   **Home:** "What is the name of your pet?" or "What year did you purchase this device?"
    *   **Office:** “Which department is located to the west of yours?”
    *   **Coffee Shop:** “How many sugars do you usually add to your coffee?”
*   **Challenge Difficulty Adjustment:** The difficulty of the challenge adjusts based on the severity of the deviation detected.
*   **AI Powered Data:** The challenge questions/answers can be pulled from a locally hosted AI trained on personal information.

**4.  Alert & Tracking:**

*   **Audible Alert Enhancement:** The audible alert can be customized by the user to include a spoken message (e.g., “This device has been marked as potentially stolen.”).
*   **Last Known Location:**  The device records the last known beacon map (i.e. the locations of the beacons it last saw before triggering the alert) to help with recovery. This can be relayed to the item providing system.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Continuous Loop

scanForBeacons()

beaconMap = buildBeaconMap(scannedBeacons)

deviation = detectDeviation(beaconMap, expectedBeaconMap)

if (deviation == "Minor") {
  // No action
} else if (deviation == "Moderate") {
  presentLowLevelChallenge()
} else if (deviation == "Major") {
  recordLastKnownLocation()
  presentFullAuthenticationSequence()
  activateAudibleAlert()
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   User device with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capability
*   Deployable BLE beacons
*   Secure storage for beacon IDs and expected beacon maps

**Software Requirements:**

*   Mobile app for beacon configuration and management
*   BLE scanning library
*   Deviation detection algorithm
*   Challenge generation engine
*   Secure data storage
*   AI engine for intelligent challenge creation.
