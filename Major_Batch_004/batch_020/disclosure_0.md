## Dynamic Network Slice Allocation for Mobile Compute

**Concept:** Extend the mobility-aware compute instance launching to incorporate dynamic network slice allocation tailored to the application running within the compute instance. Instead of simply launching a new instance, proactively adjust network characteristics (bandwidth, latency guarantees, security policies) *before* or concurrent with the mobility event.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Network Slice Orchestrator (NSO) – a new module integrated with the existing Control Plane Services.
*   **Data Input:**
    *   Mobility Event data (as in the provided patent).
    *   Application Profile – A metadata tag associated with the compute instance indicating application requirements (latency sensitivity, bandwidth needs, security level). This profile is established during instance creation/deployment.
    *   Real-time Network Conditions – Data from the communications service provider network regarding available bandwidth, congestion levels, and signal strength in the vicinity of the mobile device.
*   **Processing:**
    1.  Upon receiving a mobility event, the NSO retrieves the Application Profile associated with the compute instance serving the mobile device.
    2.  The NSO queries the CSP network for real-time conditions at the target access point (where the mobile device is moving to).
    3.  Based on the Application Profile and real-time network conditions, the NSO determines the optimal network slice configuration (bandwidth allocation, latency guarantees, security policies).
    4.  The NSO dynamically allocates a network slice to the mobile device's connection, configuring the CSP network to prioritize traffic from/to the compute instance.
    5.  If necessary, a new compute instance is launched *after* the network slice is allocated, ensuring the new instance benefits from the pre-configured network characteristics.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function handleMobilityEvent(mobilityEvent) {
  applicationProfile = getApplicationProfile(mobilityEvent.computeInstanceId);
  networkConditions = getNetworkConditions(mobilityEvent.targetAccessPoint);

  sliceConfig = determineSliceConfig(applicationProfile, networkConditions);

  allocateNetworkSlice(mobilityEvent.mobileDeviceId, sliceConfig);

  if (needNewInstance(sliceConfig)) {
    launchComputeInstance(sliceConfig); // Launch within the allocated slice
  }

  transferState(mobilityEvent.oldComputeInstanceId, mobilityEvent.newComputeInstanceId);
  terminateOldInstance(mobilityEvent.oldComputeInstanceId);
}

function determineSliceConfig(profile, conditions) {
    // Logic to analyze profile (latency, bandwidth, security) and conditions
    // Return a slice configuration object (bandwidth, latencyGuarantee, securityPolicy)
}

function allocateNetworkSlice(deviceId, config) {
  // Interface with CSP network to dynamically allocate a network slice
  // Configure slice with bandwidth, latency, security settings
}

function needNewInstance(config) {
    // Logic to determine if a new instance is required based on slice configuration
    // If slice config cannot be satisfied on existing instance, return true
}
```

*   **Hardware/Software Requirements:**
    *   Integration with existing CSP network orchestration systems.
    *   Software-defined networking (SDN) capabilities within the CSP network.
    *   API integration between Control Plane Services and CSP network systems.
    *   Secure communication channels for configuration data.
    *   Monitoring and analytics tools to track slice performance and adjust configurations dynamically.
