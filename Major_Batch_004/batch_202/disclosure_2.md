## Adaptive Spatial Audio Cancellation

**Concept:** Extend feedback suppression beyond frequency-based attenuation to incorporate spatial audio processing, actively nullifying feedback paths based on microphone and speaker positioning.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum of 4 microphones strategically positioned to capture ambient sound and identify feedback sources.
*   **Speaker Array:**  Array of speakers capable of phased audio output. Minimum of 4 speakers.
*   **High-Performance DSP:** Dedicated Digital Signal Processor for real-time audio processing, including beamforming, spatial filtering, and adaptive algorithm execution.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** Integrated IMU to track the deviceâ€™s orientation and movement. This provides crucial data for calibrating the spatial audio processing.

**2. Software Algorithm:**

*   **Feedback Path Analysis:**
    *   Utilize a swept sine wave or broadband noise injection to map the acoustic transfer function between each speaker and each microphone.
    *   Employ Time-Delay Estimation (TDE) and beamforming to pinpoint the dominant feedback paths (speaker-microphone pairings contributing most to the feedback loop).
*   **Spatial Nullification:**
    *   Implement adaptive beamforming algorithms (e.g., Delay-and-Sum, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response) to create spatial nulls in the direction of identified feedback paths.
    *   Dynamically adjust the phase and amplitude of each speaker's output to constructively interfere with the feedback signal at the microphone, while minimizing distortion to the desired audio.
*   **Dynamic Calibration:**
    *   Continuously monitor the acoustic environment using the microphone array and IMU.
    *   Adapt the spatial nullification parameters in real-time to account for changes in room acoustics, device position, and user movement.
*   **Frequency Domain Processing:**
    *   Perform the above in the frequency domain. The existing frequency band attenuation logic should be integrated with spatial nullification, layering frequency attenuation onto spatial beamforming to further reduce feedback.
*    **Gain Control Integration:**
    *   Integrate the existing gain control logic. The spatial nullification should be prioritized but if the spatial system is unable to completely resolve the feedback, existing frequency band attenuation should be engaged.

**3. Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Initialize Microphone Array
Initialize Speaker Array
Initialize IMU
Calibrate Spatial Audio System

// Main Loop
While (Device is Active) {
    // Capture Audio Data
    audioData = Capture Audio from Microphone Array

    // Analyze Feedback Paths
    feedbackPaths = Analyze Feedback (audioData, IMU Data) // Returns array of Speaker-Microphone pairs

    // Calculate Spatial Nullification Parameters
    nullificationParameters = Calculate Nullification Parameters (feedbackPaths)

    // Apply Spatial Nullification
    modifiedAudio = Apply Spatial Nullification (audioData, nullificationParameters, Speaker Array)

    // Perform Frequency Band Attenuation (existing logic)
    attenuatedAudio = Apply Frequency Band Attenuation (modifiedAudio)

    // Output Audio
    Output Audio to Speakers

    // Update Calibration (periodic)
    Update Calibration (IMU Data, Acoustic Environment)
}
