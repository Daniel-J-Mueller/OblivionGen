## Secure Data "Bubbles" with Dynamic Permissions

**Concept:** Extend the inter-application communication to create ephemeral, secure "data bubbles" where data exists *only* within the bubble, with permissions dynamically adjusted based on real-time user activity and contextual awareness. This moves beyond simple file copies to a system of controlled data access, independent of the underlying filesystem.

**Specifications:**

**1. Bubble Creation & Membership:**

*   **API Call:** `CreateBubble(BubbleID, OriginAppID, DataObjectTypes)` – An initiating application requests a bubble, specifying allowed data types (e.g., video, image, text). Returns a BubbleID for future interactions.
*   **JoinBubble(BubbleID, AppID, AccessLevel):** Applications request access to a bubble, defining their access level (Read, Write, Execute).  Access is granted/denied by the bubble’s originating app.
*   **BubbleID:** Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).
*   **AccessLevel:**  Enum: ReadOnly, ReadWrite, Execute (for scripts/plugins operating *within* the bubble).

**2. Data Handling – “Virtual Files”**

*   Data isn’t copied to a shared directory. Instead, applications operate on "virtual files" within the bubble’s namespace.
*   **VirtualFile API:** (Read, Write, Delete, GetMetadata, Enumerate). All file operations are routed through this API.
*   **Data Storage:**  Data remains in the originating application’s memory space or encrypted storage. The VirtualFile API acts as a proxy, controlling access.
*   **Data Serialization/Deserialization:**  Automatic handling of data format conversions as needed between applications (e.g., converting an image format on read).

**3. Dynamic Permissions & Contextual Awareness**

*   **Permission Rules:** Bubbles can define rules based on:
    *   **Time of Day:** Restrict access during certain hours.
    *   **Location:** Geofencing – limit access based on the user's location.
    *   **Network:** Restrict access to trusted networks.
    *   **User Activity:**  If the user is actively using a specific app, grant increased access.
*   **Real-time Policy Enforcement:** A central “Bubble Manager” service constantly evaluates permissions based on the defined rules and current context.  Access is dynamically granted or revoked.
*   **Event Triggers:** Applications can emit events signaling changes in context (e.g., “User started video playback”). The Bubble Manager subscribes to these events to trigger permission updates.

**4. Bubble Lifecycle & Destruction**

*   **Auto-Destruct:** Bubbles can be configured to automatically destroy after a period of inactivity or upon specific events.
*   **Manual Destruction:** The originating application can destroy the bubble at any time.
*   **Data Wipe:** Upon destruction, all data associated with the bubble is securely wiped from memory and storage.

**Pseudocode (Bubble Manager - Permission Check):**

```
function CheckPermission(BubbleID, AppID, Action, VirtualFilePath) {

  bubble = GetBubble(BubbleID);
  if (bubble == null) {
    return false; // Bubble doesn't exist
  }

  // Check global bubble permissions
  if (!IsAppAuthorized(bubble.AuthorizedApps, AppID)) {
    return false;
  }

  // Evaluate dynamic rules
  context = GetCurrentContext(); // Get time, location, network, user activity
  rules = bubble.PermissionRules;

  for (rule in rules) {
    if (RuleMatchesContext(rule, context)) {
      if (rule.Action == "Deny" && rule.Resource == VirtualFilePath) {
        return false;
      }
      if (rule.Action == "Allow" && rule.Resource == VirtualFilePath) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }

  // Default permission
  return bubble.DefaultPermission;
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Secure collaboration on sensitive documents.
*   Ephemeral sharing of multimedia content.
*   Sandboxed execution of third-party plugins.
*   Privacy-focused data sharing within a group.
