## Dynamic Palette-Driven Scene Generation

**Concept:** Expand the color palette recommendation system to drive *procedural scene generation*. Instead of simply recommending images *containing* colors, use the generated palette as seed data for creating entirely new visual scenes – effectively turning color preference into environment creation.

**Specs:**

**I. Core Module: Palette-to-Scene Engine**

*   **Input:** Custom Color Palette (3-5 dominant colors + weighting – derived from user input/affiliation as per the base patent).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Biome/Theme Assignment:**  Assign a primary biome/theme based on palette analysis.  (e.g., Blues/Greens = Ocean/Forest; Reds/Yellows = Desert/Savannah; Purples/Grays =  Alien Landscape/Urban Decay).  A lookup table will categorize palettes.
    2.  **Asset Selection:** Using the assigned theme, select 3D assets (trees, rocks, buildings, props) with color profiles that align with the input palette.  Color matching will employ a weighted color distance metric in a suitable color space (e.g., Lab).
    3.  **Procedural Layout:**  Employ a procedural generation algorithm (e.g., Wave Function Collapse, or a custom system) to arrange selected assets within a defined space. Asset placement is biased toward colors in the palette – assets matching dominant palette colors are placed more frequently and prominently.
    4.  **Atmospheric Effects:** Generate atmospheric effects (fog, lighting, skybox) based on the palette. (e.g., A palette with deep blues/purples creates a night scene with bioluminescent fog; A palette with bright yellows/oranges generates a hazy, sun-drenched desert scene).
    5.  **Texture Generation:** Procedurally generate or modify textures for assets to further emphasize palette colors.  This might involve color shifting, adding gradients, or applying colorized noise.
*   **Output:** A 3D scene represented as a scene graph or similar format.

**II. User Interface Integration**

*   **Palette Creation:** Integrate the existing color palette generation system into a 3D scene creation tool.
*   **Scene Preview:** Allow users to preview generated scenes in real-time.
*   **Customization:**  Provide options for:
    *   **Scene Scale:** Adjust the overall size of the generated scene.
    *   **Density:** Control the number of assets placed in the scene.
    *   **Theme Overrides:**  Manually select a theme, overriding the automatic assignment.
    *   **Asset Filtering:**  Allow users to filter available assets by category or keyword.
*   **Export:**  Enable users to export generated scenes in standard 3D formats (e.g., OBJ, FBX, GLTF).

**III. Technical Considerations**

*   **Asset Library:** Requires a large library of 3D assets with detailed color information.
*   **Procedural Generation Algorithm:** The choice of algorithm will impact the realism and variety of generated scenes.
*   **Performance Optimization:**  Procedural generation can be computationally intensive.  Optimization techniques (e.g., level of detail, caching) will be necessary.
*   **AI Integration (Future):**  Train a generative AI model to create more realistic and diverse scenes based on input palettes.  This could allow for the creation of truly unique and imaginative environments.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Scene Generation):**

```
function generateScene(palette) {
  theme = determineTheme(palette);
  assets = selectAssets(theme, palette);
  scene = createScene();

  for (i = 0; i < sceneDensity; i++) {
    asset = chooseAsset(assets);
    position = generateRandomPosition();
    color = adjustColorToPalette(asset.color, palette); //Modifies asset color
    placeAsset(scene, asset, position, color);
  }

  generateAtmosphere(scene, palette);

  return scene;
}
```
