**Adaptive Environmental Sonification System**

**Concept:** Extend the acoustic echo cancellation framework to create an immersive, adaptive environmental sonification system. Instead of *cancelling* unwanted sound, selectively *enhance* and spatialise environmental sounds to provide contextual awareness or even artistic experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum of four microphones, optimally arranged in a tetrahedral configuration for 3D sound localization. High sensitivity, low noise floor.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance embedded processor (e.g., ARM Cortex-A72 or equivalent) with dedicated DSP capabilities.
*   **Memory:** 8GB RAM, 64GB Flash Storage.
*   **Loudspeaker Array:**  Minimum of eight micro-loudspeakers, distributed strategically around the device’s perimeter.  Wide frequency response, capable of accurate spatial audio reproduction.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Scene Analysis:**  Utilize machine learning models (trained on a vast dataset of environmental sounds) to classify detected sounds (e.g., speech, traffic, birdsong, running water).  Confidence level threshold for sound identification.
    *   **Sound Source Localization:** Implement beamforming and time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) algorithms to pinpoint the location of sound sources in 3D space.  Accuracy within 10cm.
    *   **Adaptive Filtering & Spatialization:** Leverage the existing adaptive filter framework to *enhance* the amplitude of specific identified sounds. Apply Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) to spatialise the sound to its perceived location, creating a 3D audio effect.  User-adjustable spatialization intensity.
    *   **Sonification Engine:**  Allow mapping of non-audible environmental data (e.g., temperature, air quality, proximity of objects) to audible sound parameters (e.g., pitch, timbre, volume).  User-definable sonification rules.
    *   **User Interface:** Mobile app or web interface for controlling sonification rules, spatialization intensity, and sound source prioritization.
    *   **Coefficient Management:** Retain and modify adaptive filter coefficients from the echo cancellation process. Instead of minimizing coefficients during AEC, use these coefficients as a baseline for enhancement.
*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Awareness Mode:** Enhance important sounds (e.g., approaching vehicles, emergency alerts) while suppressing less relevant sounds.
    *   **Artistic Mode:** Map environmental data to musical parameters, creating a dynamic ambient soundscape.
    *   **Accessibility Mode:** Enhance speech for hearing-impaired users while suppressing background noise.
*   **Pseudocode – Sound Enhancement:**

```
//Receive audio data from microphone array
audioData = getMicrophoneData()

//Perform acoustic scene analysis
soundEvents = analyzeAudio(audioData)

//If desired sound event detected (e.g., speech)
if (soundEvents.contains("speech")) {

    //Determine sound event location using beamforming
    location = localizeSound(audioData)

    //Retrieve appropriate HRTF based on location
    hrtf = getHRTF(location)

    //Apply HRTF to sound event audio
    enhancedAudio = applyHRTF(soundEventAudio, hrtf)

    //Play enhanced audio through loudspeakers
    playAudio(enhancedAudio)
}
```

*   **Power:** USB-C, 5V/3A.  Battery backup (minimum 4 hours runtime).
