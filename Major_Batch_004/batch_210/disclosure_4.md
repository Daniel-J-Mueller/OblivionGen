## Adaptive Camouflage Housing

**Concept:** A security camera housing incorporating electrochromic or thermochromic materials to dynamically blend with its surroundings, rendering it visually less conspicuous.

**Specs:**

*   **Housing Material:** Polymer composite layered with electrochromic/thermochromic film. The composite must be weatherproof and UV resistant.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Ambient Light Sensor: Detects luminance levels for electrochromic film adjustment.
    *   Temperature Sensor: Measures surrounding temperature for thermochromic film adjustment.
    *   Color Sensor: Captures dominant colors in the camera's field of view.
    *   Micro-camera (optional): Analyzes textures and patterns in the background to refine camouflage.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Microcontroller: Processes sensor data and controls the electrochromic/thermochromic film.
    *   Algorithm:
        1.  Input: Raw data from ambient light, temperature, and color sensors. Micro-camera data (if present).
        2.  Processing:
            *   Color Matching: Algorithm analyzes the dominant colors in the background.
            *   Pattern Replication (if micro-camera present): The algorithm extracts dominant textures/patterns.
            *   Dynamic Adjustment: The microcontroller adjusts the voltage applied to the electrochromic film (or regulates heating/cooling for thermochromic film) to match the background color and, potentially, texture.
        3.  Output: Control signals to the electrochromic/thermochromic film.
*   **Power:** Low-voltage DC power supply. Option for solar-powered operation with integrated rechargeable battery.
*   **Communication:** Wireless communication (Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) for remote configuration and monitoring.
*   **Housing Dimensions:** Variable; designed to fit standard security camera housings.
*   **Layers:**
    1.  Outer Protective Layer (UV resistant, weatherproof polymer)
    2.  Electrochromic/Thermochromic Film Layer
    3.  Light Diffuser Layer (optional, for smoother color blending)
    4.  Structural Polymer Layer
*   **Modes:**
    1.  Auto: Continuously adjusts camouflage based on sensor data.
    2.  Manual: User-defined color and pattern settings.
    3.  Static: Display a user-defined static color.
