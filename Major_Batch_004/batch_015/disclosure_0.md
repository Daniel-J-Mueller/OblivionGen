## Dynamic Script Partitioning & Edge-Based Compilation

**Concept:** Instead of aggregating execution profiles *before* compilation, analyze script execution in real-time *during* usage and dynamically partition the script into 'hot', 'warm', and 'cold' regions. These regions are then compiled *differently* at the edge – closer to the user – utilizing varying degrees of optimization and code size reduction. 

**Specifications:**

*   **Component 1: Real-time Execution Monitor (REM):**
    *   Deployed as a lightweight agent on client devices (or within a sandboxed browser environment).
    *   Captures granular execution data: function call frequency, execution time, memory usage, code path variations.
    *   Data is not transmitted centrally. Aggregation happens locally.
    *   Monitors for a 'warm-up' period (e.g., 5-10 seconds) to establish baseline behavior.
    *   Outputs a dynamic 'heat map' of the script's execution.
*   **Component 2: Partitioning Engine (PE):**
    *   Runs locally on the client (or within a nearby edge server).
    *   Receives the heat map from the REM.
    *   Applies a configurable threshold to define 'hot', 'warm', and 'cold' regions.
    *   'Hot' regions: Frequently executed, performance-critical.
    *   'Warm' regions: Occasionally executed, moderate performance needs.
    *   'Cold' regions: Rarely executed, lowest priority.
*   **Component 3: Differential Compilation Module (DCM):**
    *   Receives partitioned script from PE.
    *   Employs varying compilation strategies:
        *   **'Hot' Regions:** Aggressive optimization, code inlining, loop unrolling.  Prioritize speed.  May use Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation where possible.
        *   **'Warm' Regions:** Moderate optimization, balance speed and code size. Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
        *   **'Cold' Regions:** Minimal optimization, focus on minimal code size.  Potentially interpreted or compiled with lowest-effort flags.  Could be delivered as bytecode for a virtual machine.
    *   Generates a 'compiled package' containing optimized code for each region.
*   **Component 4: Dynamic Package Loader (DPL):**
    *   Loads and executes the compiled package.
    *   Manages memory allocation and code execution for each region.
    *   Provides a unified interface for script execution.
    *   Potentially caches compiled regions for faster subsequent execution.

**Pseudocode (Partitioning Engine):**

```
function partitionScript(script, executionData):
  hotThreshold = 0.8  // 80% of execution time
  warmThreshold = 0.2 // 20% of execution time

  totalExecutionTime = sum(executionData.functionExecutionTimes)

  hotRegions = []
  warmRegions = []
  coldRegions = []

  for functionName, functionData in executionData:
    if functionData.executionTime / totalExecutionTime > hotThreshold:
      hotRegions.append(functionName)
    elif functionData.executionTime / totalExecutionTime > warmThreshold:
      warmRegions.append(functionName)
    else:
      coldRegions.append(functionName)

  return hotRegions, warmRegions, coldRegions
```

**Innovation Highlights:**

*   **Per-Client Optimization:**  Tailors optimization to individual usage patterns, unlike traditional aggregate profiling.
*   **Edge-Based Compilation:** Reduces latency and server load by performing compilation closer to the user.
*   **Granular Control:**  Allows for precise optimization of different script regions based on their importance.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:**  Can adjust partitioning and optimization strategies over time based on changing usage patterns.
