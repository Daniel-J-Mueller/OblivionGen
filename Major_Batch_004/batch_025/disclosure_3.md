## Adaptive Resource Mirroring & Predictive Scaling

**Concept:** Extend the rule-based triggering to not just *react* to conditions, but to proactively *mirror* resource configurations based on predicted future states, and then scale mirrored resources *before* demand hits. This moves beyond simple action execution to a dynamic, predictive infrastructure management system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Prediction Engine Integration:**

*   **Input:** Real-time resource metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O, disk I/O) plus historical data. Application-level metrics (transactions per second, queue depth, API latency). External data feeds (marketing campaign schedules, seasonal trends, global events).
*   **Model:** Time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM). Machine learning models trained on historical data to predict future resource demands.
*   **Output:** Predicted resource utilization curves for each resource pool over a configurable time horizon (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week). Probability distribution of future resource needs.

**2. Mirroring Configuration:**

*   **Mirror Definition:**  A configurable setting for each resource or resource pool. Defines the percentage of the primary resource to mirror.
*   **Mirror Location:**  Configurable geographic location for mirrored resources. May be the same data center, a different region, or even a different cloud provider.
*   **Mirror State:**  Mirrored resources initially exist in a paused or minimized state (e.g., virtual machines powered off, storage allocated but not actively serving data).
*   **Synchronization:** Continuous synchronization of configuration data (e.g., application code, database schemas, security policies) between primary and mirrored resources.

**3. Predictive Scaling Logic:**

*   **Trigger Condition:** When the prediction engine forecasts resource utilization exceeding a configurable threshold *within* the prediction horizon.
*   **Action Sequence:**
    1.  **Activate Mirrored Resources:** Bring the corresponding mirrored resources online.
    2.  **Load Balancing Adjustment:**  Dynamically adjust load balancing weights to distribute traffic to both primary and mirrored resources.  Can be a gradual ramp-up or an immediate switchover.
    3.  **Autoscaling Adjustment:** Initiate an autoscaling event on the *primary* resources, preparing them for the predicted increase in demand.
    4.  **Monitoring & Feedback:** Continuously monitor resource utilization. If the prediction proves inaccurate, dynamically adjust load balancing weights and autoscaling parameters.
*   **Rollback Logic:** If demand does *not* materialize as predicted, gracefully scale down mirrored resources and adjust primary resources to their original configuration.

**4. Rule Enhancement:**

*   **Predictive Rules:** Allow users to define rules based on *predicted* resource utilization, rather than just current utilization.
    *   Example: "If CPU utilization is predicted to exceed 80% within 30 minutes, activate mirrored web servers."
*   **Weighted Rules:** Allow users to assign weights to different rules. This allows for prioritization of actions when multiple rules are triggered simultaneously.

**Pseudocode Example (Simplified):**

```
// Monitor resources and collect metrics
metrics = getResourceMetrics()

// Predict future resource utilization
predictedUtilization = predictResourceUtilization(metrics)

// Check for trigger conditions
IF predictedUtilization.cpu > 80% WITHIN 30 minutes THEN
  // Activate mirrored resources
  activateMirroredResources(resourceGroup)

  // Adjust load balancing
  adjustLoadBalancer(resourceGroup, mirroredResources)

  // Initiate autoscaling
  initiateAutoscaling(resourceGroup)
ENDIF

// Continuously monitor and adjust
LOOP
  metrics = getResourceMetrics()
  predictedUtilization = predictResourceUtilization(metrics)
  // ... (adjust load balancing and autoscaling as needed) ...
ENDLOOP
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Proactive Scalability:** Reduces response time to sudden spikes in demand.
*   **Improved Resource Utilization:** Optimizes resource allocation and minimizes wasted capacity.
*   **Enhanced Reliability:** Provides redundancy and failover capabilities.
*   **Reduced Costs:** Lowers infrastructure costs by avoiding over-provisioning.
