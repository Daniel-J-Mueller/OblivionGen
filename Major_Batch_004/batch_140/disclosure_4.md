## Dynamic Resource 'Health' Forecasting & Proactive Policy Adjustment

**System Overview:**

This system expands upon the concept of metric-based access control by introducing predictive analysis of resource 'health' and dynamically adjusting policy enforcement *before* a potential security event. Instead of reacting to breaches of a static threshold, the system anticipates problematic behavior and preemptively modifies access controls.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Historical Data Collection:** Continuously gather all monitored metrics (as in the base patent) with precise timestamps.  Expand beyond anomalous activity to include performance metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O), user behavior patterns, and external threat intelligence feeds.

2.  **Time-Series Forecasting Engine:** Utilize machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM recurrent neural networks) to forecast future metric values.  Each resource will have a dedicated forecasting model, continuously trained and refined with incoming data.  Outputs include:
    *   Predicted metric value for a specific time horizon (e.g., 15 minutes, 1 hour).
    *   Confidence interval around the predicted value.
    *   Probability of exceeding a pre-defined 'warning' threshold.

3.  **Dynamic Policy Adjustment Module:**  This module receives predictions from the forecasting engine and adjusts policy enforcement parameters *proactively*.  Key features:
    *   **Risk Scoring:** Calculate a ‘risk score’ based on the predicted probability of exceeding thresholds. This score factors in the criticality of the resource and the potential impact of a security event.
    *   **Tiered Access Control:** Implement tiered access controls based on the risk score.
        *   **Low Risk:** Normal access.
        *   **Medium Risk:** Trigger multi-factor authentication (MFA) or step-up verification.
        *   **High Risk:** Block access entirely or require explicit administrator approval.
    *   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Adjust the anomalous activity threshold values dynamically based on the predicted resource 'health'.  If the model predicts increased normal activity, the threshold is temporarily raised to avoid false positives.  Conversely, if a decline in performance is forecast, the threshold is lowered to increase sensitivity.
    *   **Policy 'Shadowing':** Before implementing a change, 'shadow' the new policy by logging actions that *would* have been taken. This allows for analysis and validation of the adjustments before impacting users.

4.  **Anomaly Detection Refinement:** Use the shadow logging to refine anomaly detection. The shadow logs will contain data that shows potential false positives.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Policy Adjustment Module):**

```
FUNCTION AdjustPolicy(resourceID, predictedMetrics, riskScore, currentPolicy)

  IF riskScore > HIGH_THRESHOLD THEN
    newPolicy = BlockAccess(resourceID)
  ELSE IF riskScore > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD THEN
    newPolicy = EnableMFA(resourceID)
  ELSE
    newPolicy = currentPolicy

  #Shadow logging
  LogShadowEvent(newPolicy, resourceID)
  
  RETURN newPolicy
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION LogShadowEvent(policy, resourceID)
  # Log the action that *would* have been taken
  logEntry = {
    timestamp: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    resourceID: resourceID,
    policy: policy,
    action: "SHADOWED"
  }
  WriteToLog(logEntry)
END FUNCTION

```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Resource monitoring agents collect metrics.
2.  Metrics are sent to the time-series forecasting engine.
3.  Forecasting engine generates predictions.
4.  Dynamic Policy Adjustment Module receives predictions and calculates risk score.
5.  Module adjusts policy enforcement parameters.
6.  New policy is deployed to the policy enforcement service.
7.  Shadow logging occurs for validation.

**Novelty:**

This system shifts from *reactive* security to *predictive* security. By forecasting resource health and dynamically adjusting policies *before* anomalies occur, it reduces the attack surface and minimizes the impact of potential security events.  The shadow logging provides a safe and controlled way to validate policy changes, preventing disruptions caused by false positives. This moves beyond static thresholds, making the system far more adaptive and intelligent.
