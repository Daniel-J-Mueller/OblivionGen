## Temporal Data Sharding with Predictive Pre-Eviction

**Concept:** Extend the backend-specific cache eviction by introducing temporal data sharding *and* predictive pre-eviction based on client behavior. Instead of just TTLs determined by backend capability, we dynamically shard data based on *when* itâ€™s likely to be needed, and preemptively evict less critical data *before* its TTL expires if prediction indicates a low probability of future access.

**Specs:**

1.  **Temporal Sharding:** Divide the cache into 'time slices' (e.g., 5-minute, 15-minute, hourly).  Each time slice holds data likely needed within that timeframe.  Data is tagged with its expected time of use.
2.  **Client Behavior Profiler:** Track client request patterns (time of day, day of week, frequency, specific data requested). This creates a probabilistic model for each client.
3.  **Predictive Eviction Engine:**
    *   Continuously monitors client behavior profiles.
    *   Calculates a 'relevance score' for each cached data item *per client*.  This score represents the probability of the client requesting the data within the current time slice.
    *   If the relevance score falls below a threshold (configurable), the data is flagged for pre-eviction.
4.  **Eviction Prioritization:** When cache space is needed:
    *   First, evict flagged pre-eviction candidates.
    *   Then, apply standard TTL-based eviction.
5.  **Dynamic Time Slice Adjustment:**  The size of time slices (5-min, 15-min, etc.) is dynamically adjusted based on overall system load and the variability of client request patterns. Higher variability = shorter time slices.
6.  **Backend-Aware Prediction:**  Incorporate backend service capabilities into the prediction model. If a backend service is known to be slow, prioritize caching data frequently accessed by that service.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Eviction Engine):**

```
function predict_eviction(client_id, data_item, current_time_slice):
    client_profile = get_client_profile(client_id)
    relevance_score = calculate_relevance_score(client_profile, data_item, current_time_slice)

    if relevance_score < eviction_threshold:
        return True  # Flag for pre-eviction
    else:
        return False # Keep in cache

function calculate_relevance_score(client_profile, data_item, current_time_slice):
    # Use client's historical access data to calculate probability of requesting data_item within current_time_slice
    # (e.g., Bayesian inference, Markov models)

    # Consider factors like:
    # - Time of day
    # - Day of week
    # - Frequency of access
    # - Recency of access

    return probability_score
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ClientProfile`:  Stores historical access data (timestamps, data items requested, etc.).
*   `CacheEntry`:  Includes data, TTL, relevance score, and time slice tag.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Requires significant data collection and analysis to build accurate client profiles.
*   The eviction threshold needs to be carefully tuned to avoid excessive pre-eviction.
*   Could leverage machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
*   The system should be designed to handle high throughput and low latency.
