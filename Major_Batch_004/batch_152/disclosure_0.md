## Adaptive Bio-Impedance & Photoplethysmography Fusion for Continuous Calibration

**Concept:** Combine near-infrared imaging (like the patent) with bio-impedance analysis (BIA) to create a truly calibration-free, continuous blood pressure & physiological parameter monitoring system. The patent focuses on *detecting* blood vessel changes. This builds on that by *actively calibrating* the system *without* relying on external devices like sphygmomanometers.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Wearable band (wrist, upper arm, or chest) incorporating:
        *   NIR Camera Array: Multiple NIR cameras (wavelength range 700-1000nm) arranged in a circular or linear configuration for wider field of view and redundancy. Resolution: 640x480 minimum. Frame rate: 30-60fps.
        *   Multi-Frequency BIA Module: Four or more frequencies (e.g., 5kHz, 50kHz, 100kHz, 200kHz) to measure impedance across the body segment.  Four-electrode configuration for accurate measurement.
        *   Stimulation Electrodes:  Small electrodes for delivering very low-amplitude, high-frequency electrical stimulation to influence localized blood vessel diameter *without* causing discomfort.
        *   Processing Unit:  Embedded ARM Cortex-A72 or equivalent with dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) for on-device data analysis.
        *   Memory: 8GB RAM, 64GB Flash storage.
        *   Communication: Bluetooth 5.2, Wi-Fi 6.
        *   Power: Rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery (minimum 8 hours runtime).
*   **Software & Algorithm:**
    *   **BIA Baseline:** Initial BIA measurement establishes baseline body composition (water, fat, muscle) and impedance characteristics.
    *   **NIR Vessel Tracking:** NIR camera tracks diameter changes of radial & ulnar arteries (and potentially other superficial vessels) over time.
    *   **Stimulation Protocol:** Algorithm initiates brief, low-level electrical stimulation to the forearm (between BIA electrodes) to induce *temporary* and controlled vasodilation/vasoconstriction.  Stimulation amplitude is dynamically adjusted based on BIA readings and NIR vessel diameter responses.
    *   **Calibration Loop:**
        1.  Initiate Stimulation.
        2.  Monitor BIA changes (reflecting fluid shifts due to vasodilation/vasoconstriction).
        3.  Simultaneously monitor NIR vessel diameter changes.
        4.  Use machine learning (specifically a recurrent neural network like LSTM or GRU) to correlate BIA signal changes with NIR vessel diameter changes *in real-time*.  This creates a personalized calibration curve for each user.
        5.  Repeat calibration loop periodically (e.g., every 15-30 minutes) to account for physiological changes.
    *   **Blood Pressure Estimation:** Use calibrated relationship between NIR vessel diameter changes and BIA signals to continuously estimate systolic and diastolic blood pressure. 
    *   **Physiological Parameter Derivation:**  Derive other parameters like heart rate variability (HRV), arterial stiffness, and vascular resistance from combined NIR and BIA data.
    *   **Data Logging & Visualization:**  Store data locally and sync to a cloud platform for analysis and visualization.

**Pseudocode (Calibration Loop):**

```
function calibrate() {
  stimulation_amplitude = base_amplitude;
  while (calibration_required()) {
    apply_stimulation(stimulation_amplitude);
    bia_signal = read_bia();
    vessel_diameter = read_vessel_diameter();
    correlation = calculate_correlation(bia_signal, vessel_diameter);

    if (correlation < threshold) {
      stimulation_amplitude = adjust_amplitude(stimulation_amplitude); // Increase/Decrease amplitude
    } else {
      // Calibration successful
      store_calibration_data(bia_signal, vessel_diameter, stimulation_amplitude);
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This approach moves beyond static calibration with a sphygmomanometer and creates a *dynamic*, *self-calibrating* system.  The combination of BIA (providing information about fluid shifts and overall body composition) with NIR imaging (providing direct visualization of vessel dynamics) offers a more robust and accurate method for continuous blood pressure monitoring.  The closed-loop calibration using electrical stimulation ensures the system adapts to individual physiological variations and maintains accuracy over time.  The stimulation is localized and low-level, minimizing discomfort.
