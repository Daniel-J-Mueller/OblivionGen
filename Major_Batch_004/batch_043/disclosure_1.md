## Dynamic Item ‘Mood Boards’

**Concept:** Extend the personalized layout concept to incorporate visual ‘mood boards’ within search results, adapting not just *how* items are displayed, but *with* what aesthetic context. This moves beyond category-specific layouts to a more nuanced, visually-driven personalization.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Mood Profile Generation:**

*   **User Visual Preference Data:**  Collect explicit (user-selected themes/styles) and implicit (image dwell time, image saves/shares, color palette preference from previously viewed/purchased items) data about user visual preferences.
*   **Item Image Feature Extraction:** Employ computer vision to extract dominant colors, textures, styles (e.g., minimalist, rustic, modern) from item images.  Store these as feature vectors associated with each item.
*   **Mood Profile Creation:** Construct a user ‘Mood Profile’ – a weighted vector representing preferred visual attributes (colors, textures, styles).  The weights are determined from the user’s visual preference data. This profile is dynamic, adjusting with user interactions.

**2. Search Result ‘Mood Board’ Generation:**

*   **Keyword & Mood Profile Matching:** During a search, match the keyword with the user’s Mood Profile.  This isn't about finding *items* within a category; it’s about finding a *visual style* for presenting the results.
*   **Background & Accent Generation:** Generate a subtle background image or color scheme for the search result block, based on the Mood Profile. This isn’t a full-page takeover, but a contextual visual cue.  Accent colors can be used for price tags, "Add to Cart" buttons, etc., to maintain consistency.
*   **Item Image Filtering/Adjustment:**  Slightly adjust item images to better align with the Mood Profile. This could involve:
    *   **Color Tinting:** Apply a subtle color tint to item images.
    *   **Texture Overlay:** Overlay a subtle texture (e.g., linen, wood grain) on item images.
    *   **Stylized Filters:** Apply a light filter that mimics a specific photographic style (e.g., vintage, high-contrast). *These are subtle adjustments, preserving the item's core visual appearance.*
*   **Dynamic Mood Board Variety:** Offer a small number (e.g., 3-5) of dynamically generated Mood Boards per search query, allowing the user to choose their preferred aesthetic.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Mood Profile Service:** A dedicated service responsible for storing and managing user Mood Profiles.
*   **Image Processing Pipeline:** A scalable pipeline for extracting image features and applying visual adjustments.
*   **Search Result Rendering Service:** Integrates with the existing search rendering infrastructure to inject the Mood Board elements.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateSearchResults(user, query):
  moodProfile = MoodProfileService.getUserMoodProfile(user)
  searchResults = SearchService.getSearchResults(query)

  for each item in searchResults:
    adjustedImage = ImageProcessingPipeline.adjustImage(item.imageUrl, moodProfile)
    item.imageUrl = adjustedImage

  moodBoardStyle = moodProfile.getPreferredStyle()
  searchResultBlock = SearchResultBlock.render(searchResults, moodBoardStyle)

  return searchResultBlock
```

**Expansion possibilities:**

*   **Mood-Based Filtering:** Allow users to filter search results based on specific moods or styles.
*   **AI-Generated Mood Boards:** Use AI to create unique and personalized Mood Boards on the fly.
*   **Collaborative Mood Boards:** Allow users to share and collaborate on Mood Boards with friends or family.
