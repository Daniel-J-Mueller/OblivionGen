## Adaptive Sensor Fusion Network for Predictive Collision Avoidance

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply *detecting* objects within zones and instead create a continuously learning, predictive collision avoidance system leveraging a distributed sensor network and probabilistic trajectory modeling. This moves from reactive avoidance to proactive anticipation.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **UAV Sensor Suite:** Each UAV equipped with:
    *   High-resolution LiDAR (range: 200m, FOV: 90 degrees)
    *   Stereo Vision System (baseline: 0.5m, resolution: 4K)
    *   Millimeter Wave Radar (range: 300m, frequency: 77GHz)
    *   Acoustic Sensor Array (frequency range: 20Hz - 20kHz) - focused on detecting rotor wash from other UAVs.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and GPS for precise localization.
*   **Ground-Based Sensor Network (Optional):** Strategically placed ground sensors (LiDAR, Radar, Cameras) to provide a broader environmental understanding – especially in areas with limited UAV visibility.
*   **Edge Computing Units:** Each UAV and ground sensor equipped with a powerful processing unit (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin) for real-time data processing.
*   **Secure Communication Link:** Dedicated, low-latency communication channel (e.g., 5G, dedicated mesh network) for data exchange between UAVs and ground stations.

**II. Software Architecture:**

1.  **Sensor Fusion Module:**
    *   Employs a Kalman Filter (or Extended Kalman Filter) to fuse data from all sensors.
    *   Adaptive weighting of sensor data based on environmental conditions (e.g., LiDAR prioritized in clear weather, radar prioritized in fog).
    *   Confidence estimation for each fused data point.
2.  **Object Tracking & Prediction Module:**
    *   Utilizes a multi-hypothesis tracking algorithm (e.g., Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter - JPDAF) to maintain track of multiple objects simultaneously.
    *   Employs a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to predict object trajectories. LSTM trained on historical flight data, object maneuverability models, and environmental factors (wind, altitude, etc.).
    *   Probabilistic trajectory representation: Output is a probability distribution over possible future trajectories, not a single predicted path.
3.  **Collision Risk Assessment Module:**
    *   Calculates collision risk based on the predicted trajectories of all objects.
    *   Utilizes a collision time-to-impact (TTI) metric, weighted by the probability of each trajectory.
    *   Dynamic risk threshold adjustment based on UAV speed, maneuverability, and mission criticality.
4.  **Cooperative Path Planning Module:**
    *   Communicates collision risk information to neighboring UAVs.
    *   Employs a decentralized, consensus-based path planning algorithm.
    *   Each UAV locally optimizes its path to minimize collision risk while achieving its mission objectives.
    *   Potential use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train UAVs to collaboratively avoid collisions in complex scenarios.
5.  **Data Sharing & Network Management:**
    *   Uses a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for efficient data sharing between UAVs.
    *   Nodes maintain a local copy of the environmental map and object tracks.
    *   DHT handles node discovery, data replication, and fault tolerance.

**III. Pseudocode (Cooperative Path Planning):**

```
// UAV Node i

function plan_path() {
  // 1. Receive collision risk data from neighboring UAVs (DHT)
  risk_data = get_risk_data_from_DHT();

  // 2. Calculate own collision risk based on sensor data
  own_risk = calculate_own_risk();

  // 3. Combine own risk and received risk
  combined_risk = merge_risk_data(own_risk, combined_risk);

  // 4. Generate candidate paths
  candidate_paths = generate_candidate_paths();

  // 5. Evaluate candidate paths based on risk and mission cost
  evaluated_paths = evaluate_paths(candidate_paths, combined_risk);

  // 6. Select optimal path
  optimal_path = select_optimal_path(evaluated_paths);

  // 7. Communicate path to neighboring UAVs (DHT)
  publish_path_to_DHT(optimal_path);

  // 8. Execute path
  execute_path(optimal_path);
}
```

**IV. Novel Aspects:**

*   **Probabilistic Trajectory Prediction:** Moves beyond deterministic prediction to account for uncertainty in object behavior.
*   **Distributed Risk Assessment:** Leverages a cooperative sensor network to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the airspace.
*   **Decentralized Path Planning:** Enables rapid adaptation to changing conditions without relying on a central authority.
*   **Adaptive Sensor Fusion:** Dynamically adjusts sensor weighting based on environmental conditions and data quality.
