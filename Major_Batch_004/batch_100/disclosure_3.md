## Adaptive Component Granularity & Staged Rendering

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust the granularity of speculatively generated network page components, combined with a staged rendering pipeline prioritizing visible content.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on *what* to speculatively generate. This specification addresses *how much* and *when* to render, optimizing for perceived performance and resource utilization.  Current web pages often over-render – generating components far beyond the viewport, wasting resources. This system aims to address that waste.

**Components:**

*   **Granularity Controller:** Responsible for dividing network page components into sub-components based on visual complexity and viewport proximity.
*   **Viewport Prediction Engine:**  Predicts viewport movement based on user input (mouse, touch, scroll) and device sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer).
*   **Resource Budget Manager:** Tracks available computing resources (CPU, GPU, memory) and dynamically adjusts the granularity of speculative generation.
*   **Staged Rendering Pipeline:**  A rendering pipeline that prioritizes visible content, rendering high-priority components first, followed by progressively lower-priority components.
*   **Component Cache (Expanded):** The existing cache is expanded to include sub-component caches, optimized for quick assembly and rendering.

**Operation:**

1.  **Initial Request:** A request for a network page is received. The system initiates speculative generation, but *not* of entire components, but of sub-components. The Granularity Controller divides components based on a pre-defined complexity hierarchy.  A simple button might be a single sub-component, while a complex data table would be divided into rows, columns, and individual cells.
2.  **Viewport Prediction:** The Viewport Prediction Engine analyzes user input and device sensors to predict the visible region of the page.
3.  **Resource Allocation:** The Resource Budget Manager determines the available computing resources.  If resources are limited, the Granularity Controller increases the granularity of speculative generation – generating smaller sub-components.
4.  **Speculative Generation (Granular):**  Speculative generation focuses on sub-components within and near the predicted viewport. The prioritization within speculative generation is based on the probability (as per the patent) and visual prominence.
5.  **Staged Rendering:** The Staged Rendering Pipeline renders the highest-priority, visible sub-components first.  As the viewport moves, lower-priority sub-components are rendered on demand.
6.  **Cache Management:** Sub-components are cached based on usage frequency and resource availability.  Frequently used sub-components are kept in a fast cache (e.g., GPU memory), while less frequently used sub-components are stored in a slower cache (e.g., system memory).
7.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The Granularity Controller and Staged Rendering Pipeline continuously adjust the granularity of speculative generation and rendering based on user interaction, device sensors, and resource availability.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Controller):**

```
function determineSubComponentGranularity(component, viewport, resourceBudget) {
  complexityScore = calculateComponentComplexity(component)
  distanceFromViewport = calculateDistanceToViewport(component, viewport)

  if (resourceBudget < LOW_THRESHOLD) {
    granularity = HIGH // Generate very small sub-components
  } else if (complexityScore > HIGH_THRESHOLD && distanceFromViewport < MEDIUM_THRESHOLD) {
    granularity = MEDIUM // Generate moderately sized sub-components
  } else {
    granularity = LOW // Generate large or entire components
  }

  return granularity
}

function calculateComponentComplexity(component) {
  // Logic to calculate complexity based on DOM size, number of images, etc.
  // Returns a score from 0 to 100
}

function calculateDistanceToViewport(component, viewport) {
  // Logic to calculate distance between component and viewport
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced network latency.
*   Improved perceived performance.
*   Reduced resource utilization.
*   Enhanced user experience.
