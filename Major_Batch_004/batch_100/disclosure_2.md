## Adaptive Predictive Alert Zones - "Guardian"

**Concept:** Expand beyond static alert/detection zones by implementing a system that *predicts* potential intrusion paths based on observed movement patterns and environmental data, dynamically adjusting alert zones *before* an event occurs.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Two (or more) PIR motion sensors (as in the base patent) – “Broad Scan” and “Fine Scan”.
    *   Low-resolution thermal camera – for basic heat signature detection and environmental temperature mapping.
    *   Microphone array – for sound event detection (glass break, shouting) and directional audio analysis.
    *   Optional: Weather sensor (temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction) – for environmental data correlation.

*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated edge computing module (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano) – handles real-time data processing and predictive modeling.

*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Baseline Behavior Learning:** Algorithm that continuously monitors sensor data to establish “normal” movement patterns within the monitored area. Uses time-series analysis and anomaly detection techniques.
    *   **Path Prediction Engine:** Core module. Based on observed movement *towards* the defined alert zones (from Baseline Behavior Learning), uses a simplified physics model to predict potential trajectories.  Considers:
        *   Movement speed & direction
        *   Obstacle avoidance (learned from environment map - see below)
        *   Likelihood of continuing along the predicted path (based on historical data)
    *   **Dynamic Zone Adjustment:** Alters the alert zone boundaries based on Path Prediction Engine output.  “Preemptive” zones expand or shift to cover predicted intrusion paths.
    *   **Environmental Mapping:** Builds a simplified 3D map of the monitored area using thermal camera data and potentially, LiDAR (optional).  Used to enhance path prediction accuracy.
    *   **Alert Prioritization:**  Assigns risk levels to predicted intrusions based on predicted path, speed of movement, and sound event analysis. Higher-risk predictions trigger immediate alerts.

*   **Communication:** WiFi/Cellular connectivity for remote monitoring and alert transmission.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Zone Adjustment):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Gather sensor data (PIR, Thermal, Microphone)
  sensorData = getSensorData()

  // 2. Update baseline behavior model
  updateBaseline(sensorData)

  // 3. Predict potential intrusion paths
  predictedPaths = predictPaths(sensorData, baselineModel)

  // 4. Adjust alert zones
  for each path in predictedPaths {
    if (path.riskLevel > threshold) {
      // Expand alert zone to encompass path
      adjustAlertZone(path)
    }
  }

  // 5. Send alerts if intrusion detected within adjusted zone
  sendAlerts()

  // 6. Sleep for a short period
  sleep(0.1 seconds)
}

// Function: adjustAlertZone(path)
// Expands the alert zone to cover the predicted path.
// Considers the speed and direction of the movement.
adjustAlertZone(path) {
  zoneWidth = path.speed * 0.5  // Example: Wider zone for faster movement
  zoneHeight = path.speed * 0.2
  zoneX = path.x
  zoneY = path.y

  // Apply zone expansion to current alert zone boundaries
  // (Implementation details dependent on specific hardware)
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced false alarms by only alerting on *predicted* intrusions.
*   Increased security by proactively anticipating potential threats.
*   Adaptive security tailored to specific environments and user behaviors.
*   Could be used for automated security patrols (e.g., drones or robots).
