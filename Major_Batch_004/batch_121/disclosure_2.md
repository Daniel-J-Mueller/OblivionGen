## Adaptive Semantic Drift Correction for Multi-Turn Dialogue

**Concept:** The provided patent focuses on routing requests based on initial semantic interpretation and user feedback. This inspires a system which *actively* corrects semantic drift during a multi-turn conversation, not just at the point of routing, but *during* the interpretation itself. Instead of simply selecting a skill based on an initial interpretation and later feedback, this system builds a probabilistic model of how the user's *intended* meaning evolves over the course of the dialogue.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Data Structures:**

*   `DialogueState`:  A data structure holding the complete conversational history. Includes:
    *   `UtteranceList`: List of all utterances in the dialogue.
    *   `SemanticInterpretationList`: List of semantic interpretations for each utterance.
    *   `ConfidenceScores`: List of confidence scores associated with each semantic interpretation.
    *   `DriftVector`: A multi-dimensional vector representing the current estimated semantic drift.  Each dimension corresponds to a semantic feature (e.g., topic, intent, entity type).
*   `SemanticFeature`:  A class representing a specific semantic feature. Includes:
    *   `FeatureName`: String identifier for the feature.
    *   `FeatureValue`: Current value of the feature.
    *   `Volatility`: A measure of how likely the feature is to change during the conversation.
    *   `DriftRate`: The rate at which the feature is drifting.

**2. Modules:**

*   **Semantic Interpreter (SI):**  Receives user utterance.  Outputs initial semantic interpretation and confidence score. Standard NLP pipeline.
*   **Drift Estimator (DE):**
    *   Input: `DialogueState`, `SemanticInterpretationList`, `ConfidenceScores`.
    *   Function:  Analyzes changes in semantic interpretation over time.  Calculates the `DriftVector` representing the estimated semantic drift. Uses a Kalman filter to smooth the drift estimation and predict future drift.
    *   Output: Updated `DialogueState` with revised `DriftVector`.
*   **Interpretation Corrector (IC):**
    *   Input: User utterance, initial interpretation from SI, `DialogueState` (including `DriftVector`).
    *   Function:  Applies the `DriftVector` to the initial interpretation. This involves:
        *   Adjusting semantic feature values based on the drift.
        *   Re-scoring the confidence of the adjusted interpretation.
    *   Output: Corrected semantic interpretation and confidence score.
*   **Feedback Integrator (FI):**
    *   Input: User feedback (explicit or implicit), corrected semantic interpretation, actual outcome of interaction.
    *   Function:  Compares the predicted outcome (based on the corrected interpretation) with the actual outcome.  Adjusts the `Volatility` and `DriftRate` of relevant semantic features in the `DialogueState`. Uses a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to optimize the adjustment process.
    *   Output: Updated `DialogueState`.

**3. Pseudocode (Interpretation Correction):**

```
FUNCTION CorrectInterpretation(utterance, initial_interpretation, dialogue_state):

  drift_vector = dialogue_state.drift_vector
  corrected_interpretation = initial_interpretation.copy()

  FOR each feature IN corrected_interpretation.features:
    feature_name = feature.name
    drift_value = drift_vector.get_value(feature_name)  // Get drift for this feature
    feature.value = feature.value + drift_value  // Apply drift
    feature.confidence = recalibrate_confidence(feature.confidence, drift_value) // Adjust confidence

  RETURN corrected_interpretation
```

**4.  Implementation Notes:**

*   **Semantic Features:** The choice of semantic features is crucial. Examples include: topic, intent, entities, sentiment, user preferences, conversational context.
*   **Confidence Recalibration:** The `recalibrate_confidence` function should account for the magnitude and direction of the drift.  Larger drifts should result in lower confidence.
*   **Feedback Mechanisms:**  Explicit feedback could be collected through user ratings or clarification prompts. Implicit feedback could be inferred from user behavior (e.g., rephrasing, abandonment).
*   **Model Training:** The system should be trained on a large dataset of conversational data to learn the typical patterns of semantic drift.
