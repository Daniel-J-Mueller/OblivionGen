## Dynamic Decoy Network Generation

**Concept:** Extend the “misleading attacker” approach by not just altering responses *to* probes, but by dynamically generating entire decoy network segments *in response* to detected scanning activity. This moves beyond simple service misidentification to a full-scale illusion.

**Specifications:**

**1. Network Topology Mapping & Response Engine:**

*   **Input:** Real-time network traffic data, detected port scans (as per existing patent), network topology database (internal mapping of legitimate services/IPs).
*   **Process:** Upon detecting a port scan, analyze scan patterns (port ranges, timing, source IP).  Based on this analysis, generate a *customized* decoy network segment. This segment is *not* pre-built.
*   **Output:**  A network configuration file defining the decoy segment.

**2. Decoy Segment Generation:**

*   **Dynamic IP Allocation:** Allocate a block of unused IPs (from a pre-defined range, or dynamically acquired via DHCP reservation).
*   **Virtual Machine (VM) Provisioning:**  Spin up lightweight VMs (containerized preferred) – number determined by scan intensity.  These VMs host 'fake' services.
*   **Service Emulation:** Based on the scan, select and configure services to emulate.  Prioritize services *similar* to those being probed, but with subtle differences in versions or configurations.  The system should support a library of emulated services (web servers, databases, SSH, etc.).  These aren't full implementations – they just need to *respond* believably to basic probes.
*   **Network Routing:**  Configure routing rules to direct traffic from the attacker’s IP address *to* the generated decoy segment.  Use Network Address Translation (NAT) to mask the decoy IPs.
*   **Traffic Mirroring (Optional):**  Mirror a small percentage of legitimate traffic to the decoy segment to add realism.

**3. Adaptive Response & Monitoring:**

*   **Behavioral Analysis:**  Monitor the attacker’s interaction with the decoy segment. Track requests, exploits attempted, data accessed.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Adjust the decoy segment in real-time based on attacker behavior.  For example, if the attacker tries to exploit a specific vulnerability, create more instances of the vulnerable service.
*   **Delayed Detection of Real Services:** Introduce artificial latency on the *real* services being targeted, making the attacker spend more time interacting with the decoys.
*   **Attack Surface Expansion:** Proactively expand the attack surface within the decoy network (introducing new, emulated services) to further divert the attacker's attention.
*   **Honeypot Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with existing honeypot systems to enhance threat intelligence gathering.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
function handle_port_scan(source_ip, scan_data):
  decoy_network = create_decoy_network(source_ip, scan_data)
  configure_routing(source_ip, decoy_network)
  monitor_interaction(source_ip, decoy_network)

function create_decoy_network(source_ip, scan_data):
  allocate_ip_range()
  num_vms = determine_vm_count(scan_data)
  for i in range(num_vms):
    vm = provision_vm()
    service = select_emulated_service(scan_data)
    configure_service(vm, service)
  return decoy_network

function select_emulated_service(scan_data):
  # Analyze scan data to determine which services to emulate
  # (e.g., if the scan probes port 80, emulate a web server)
  return service

function configure_service(vm, service):
  # Configure the VM to run the emulated service
  # (e.g., install web server software, configure virtual hosts)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Virtualization platform (e.g., VMware, KVM, Docker)
*   Network monitoring tools
*   Traffic analysis software
*   Database for storing network topology and attack data
*   High-bandwidth network connection

This system allows for a far more robust defense by not simply hiding services, but creating an entirely fabricated network environment to ensnare and mislead attackers. It shifts the burden from detection *and* response to *deception* and *containment*.
