## Dynamic Network Persona Construction & Behavioral Drift Detection

**Concept:** Extend tiered analysis to build and maintain "network personas" for individual communication endpoints, dynamically adjusting risk profiles based on observed behavioral drift. This moves beyond simple signature/criteria matching to proactive anomaly detection rooted in established baseline behavior.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Database:** A scalable database (key-value store recommended) storing network personas. Persona data includes:
    *   Endpoint Identifier (IP address, MAC address, etc.)
    *   Communication History (timestamped logs of destination IPs, ports, protocols, data volumes, packet sizes, request types - categorized)
    *   Behavioral Baseline: Statistical models (moving averages, standard deviations, Markov chains) representing expected communication patterns for each category (e.g., DNS requests, web browsing, file transfer).
    *   Risk Score: A weighted score reflecting deviations from the behavioral baseline.
    *   Trust Level: Initial trust level assigned to the endpoint (e.g., based on source network, known reputation).

*   **Tier 1 – Persona Acquisition & Baseline Establishment:**
    *   Incoming traffic triggers persona lookup. If persona exists, update communication history. If not, create a new persona with an initial (low) trust level.
    *   Initial communication data is used to establish a preliminary behavioral baseline for each communication category.
    *   Pseudocode:

    ```
    function on_new_flow(flow_data):
      persona = get_persona(flow_data.source_ip)
      if persona is null:
        persona = create_persona(flow_data.source_ip)
      persona.add_communication(flow_data)
      persona.update_baseline()
      return persona
    ```

*   **Tier 2 – Behavioral Drift Analysis:**
    *   Upon receiving communication data, calculate a "drift score" for each communication category.  This score represents how much the current communication deviates from the established baseline (e.g., using a z-score or similar statistical measure).
    *   Update the persona’s overall risk score based on the weighted average of drift scores across all categories.
    *   Pseudocode:

    ```
    function analyze_drift(persona, flow_data):
      drift_scores = {}
      for category in categories:
        drift_score = calculate_drift(persona.baseline[category], flow_data[category])
        drift_scores[category] = drift_score

      persona.risk_score = calculate_weighted_average(drift_scores)
      return persona.risk_score
    ```

*   **Tier 3 – Dynamic Response:**
    *   Based on the risk score, trigger a dynamic response:
        *   Low Risk: Allow traffic.
        *   Medium Risk:  Mirror traffic to a sandboxing environment for deeper analysis, implement rate limiting, or require multi-factor authentication.
        *   High Risk: Terminate the connection, quarantine the endpoint, or alert security personnel.
    *   Adaptive Trust: Adjust the endpoint's trust level based on observed behavior. Positive behavior increases trust, while negative behavior decreases it.

*   **Data Enrichment:** Integrate with threat intelligence feeds to supplement behavioral analysis. Cross-reference endpoint information with known malicious actors and indicators of compromise.

*   **Feedback Loop:** Incorporate feedback from security analysts and incident responders to refine behavioral models and improve accuracy.



This system moves beyond static criteria to create a proactive, adaptive security posture that learns and responds to evolving threats based on individual endpoint behavior. It's less about blocking known bad actors and more about identifying anomalous behavior that could indicate a compromised system or a novel attack.
