## Dynamic Inventory Mapping & Predictive Replenishment with Drone Swarms

**System Overview:** This system extends the core concept of event/actor association by integrating a drone swarm for real-time inventory analysis and predictive replenishment based on observed actor behaviors. It shifts the focus from *detecting* events to *anticipating* needs based on pre-event indicators.

**Core Components:**

*   **Drone Swarm:** A network of small, autonomous drones equipped with:
    *   High-resolution RGB-D cameras
    *   Edge computing units for initial data processing (object detection, pose estimation)
    *   Secure wireless communication modules
    *   Limited payload capacity (for small item delivery - contingency)
*   **Central Processing Unit (Server):** Hosts the AI models for:
    *   Actor tracking and behavior analysis
    *   Inventory mapping and object recognition
    *   Predictive modeling of item demand
    *   Swarm coordination and task allocation
*   **Sensor Network:** Existing camera system + weight sensors/RFID/LIDAR (as detailed in the original patent) + the drones themselves contribute to the sensor network.
*   **Virtual Inventory Model:** A dynamically updated 3D representation of the shelf/storage area, maintained by the system.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Drones autonomously patrol the storage area, capturing visual and depth data.
2.  **Actor Tracking & Behavior Analysis:** The AI system tracks actorsâ€™ movements, gaze direction, and interaction with items on the shelf. It identifies "pre-event" behaviors (e.g., prolonged gazing at a specific item, reaching for a nearby item, checking price tags).
3.  **Virtual Inventory Update:** Drone-captured data continuously updates the virtual inventory model, detecting changes in item quantities, positions, and orientations.  This system would use a point cloud registration process, updating the model in real time.
4.  **Predictive Modeling:**  The AI system uses historical data and real-time behavior analysis to predict which items are likely to be purchased or removed from the shelf in the near future. This could leverage recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.
5.  **Automated Replenishment:** Based on the predictive model, the system automatically generates replenishment requests, triggering restocking processes (either manual or automated via robotics). 
6.  **Anomaly Detection:** The system monitors for unusual behavior (e.g., an actor attempting to conceal an item) and alerts security personnel.

**Pseudocode - Predictive Replenishment Engine:**

```
// Data Structures
Item: {id, name, quantity, last_updated}
Actor: {id, position, gaze_direction, interaction_history}
PreEvent: {type, item_id, confidence}

// Function: PredictDemand
Input: Actor actor, List<Item> inventory
Output: List<PreEvent> predicted_demand

predicted_demand = []

// Analyze actor behavior
behavior_data = AnalyzeBehavior(actor)

// Identify pre-event indicators
for each pre_event_type in pre_event_types:
    if IsPreEventDetected(behavior_data, pre_event_type):
        item_id = GetAssociatedItemId(pre_event_type)
        confidence = CalculateConfidence(item_id, behavior_data)

        pre_event = {type: pre_event_type, item_id: item_id, confidence: confidence}
        predicted_demand.append(pre_event)

return predicted_demand

// Function: UpdateInventory
Input: List<PreEvent> predicted_demand, List<Item> inventory
Output: List<Item> updated_inventory

for each pre_event in predicted_demand:
    item_id = pre_event.item_id
    confidence = pre_event.confidence

    //Adjust predicted demand based on confidence
    predicted_quantity = confidence * 0.5 //example weighting

    //Update quantity in virtual inventory
    item = FindItem(item_id, inventory)
    item.quantity -= predicted_quantity

    //Trigger replenishment if below threshold
    if item.quantity < replenishment_threshold:
        GenerateReplenishmentRequest(item)
```

**Novelty & Differentiation:** This system moves beyond *reacting* to events (item removal) to *proactively anticipating* demand. By integrating drone swarms and predictive modeling, it offers a more efficient and automated inventory management solution. The integration of behavior analysis (gaze tracking, interaction history) adds a layer of intelligence that enhances the accuracy of demand prediction.
