## Dynamic Topical Graph Evolution & Personalization

**Concept:** Extend the keyword-based suggestion system by evolving the collaborative filtering graph *itself* based on emerging topical trends *and* individual user interaction drift. Rather than a static graph, continuously reshape connections based on a rolling analysis of keyword commonalities *and* deviations.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Collaborative Filtering Graph (existing)
    *   Item Descriptions (existing)
    *   User Interaction Data (existing – clicks, purchases, ratings, time spent)
    *   Real-Time News/Trend APIs (e.g., Google Trends, Twitter API – focused on item categories)
*   **Modules:**
    *   **Trend Detection Module:** Monitors news/trend APIs for topical shifts within item categories.  Assigns "Trend Scores" to keywords based on external validation.
    *   **Graph Evolution Module:**
        *   **Connection Weighting:**  Existing edges in the CF graph have weights based on co-occurrence counts. These weights are *dynamically adjusted* based on:
            *   Trend Scores of shared keywords between connected nodes.
            *   User interaction data – If users are increasingly diverging from historical patterns for a given item pairing, the edge weight *decreases*. If engagement increases, weight increases.
        *   **Edge Creation/Deletion:** New edges are created between nodes based on:
            *   Significant shared keywords *and* Trend Scores exceeding a threshold.
            *   User behavior – If a substantial number of users are interacting with previously unconnected items in close proximity, an edge is created.
            *   Edges are deleted if weights fall below a threshold *and* there's been no interaction in a defined timeframe.
        *   **Node Splitting:** If a node represents a broad category (e.g., “shoes”), and Trend Scores indicate a significant sub-trend (e.g., "sustainable running shoes"), the node *splits* into two nodes, inheriting existing connections and keywords.
    *   **Personalized Graph Replication:**  Each user has a *local copy* of the CF graph.  This graph is initialized from the global graph but is *updated independently* based on their interactions.  The rate of divergence from the global graph is controlled by a ‘personalization factor’.
    *   **Suggestion Generation:**  Suggestions are generated by:
        *   Analyzing keywords common to the user’s current context (e.g., viewed items, search query).
        *   Traversing the user’s personalized graph to identify closely connected nodes.
        *   Prioritizing suggestions based on combined graph proximity, keyword relevance, *and* Trend Scores.

**Pseudocode (Graph Evolution Module - Simplified):**

```
function update_graph(global_graph, user_interactions, trend_data, timeframe):
  for each edge in global_graph:
    edge.weight = base_weight * (1 + trend_score_influence * trend_data[edge.keywords]) * (1 + user_interaction_influence * user_interactions[edge.nodes])

  for each node pair not connected:
    shared_keywords = find_shared_keywords(node1, node2)
    trend_score = average(trend_data[shared_keywords])
    if trend_score > threshold and user_interaction_potential(node1, node2) > threshold:
      create_edge(node1, node2, weight = initial_weight)

  for each edge where edge.weight < deletion_threshold and last_interaction > timeframe:
    delete_edge(edge)

  if significant_trend_detected(trend_data):
    split_node(broad_category_node, new_sub_category_node)
```

**Innovation:** The system is not merely suggesting items based on static relationships and keywords, but *adapting* the relationships themselves to reflect evolving trends and individual user preferences, creating a continuously refining recommendation engine. This addresses the problem of "filter bubbles" and provides more dynamic, relevant suggestions.
