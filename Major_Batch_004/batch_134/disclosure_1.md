**Adaptive Haptic Decision Tree Navigation**

**Specification:**

**Device:** Mobile computing device with haptic feedback engine (advanced vibratory/texture simulation) and touchscreen display.

**Core Concept:** Replace visual decision tree navigation within the text message interface with *haptic* navigation. The user ‘feels’ the decision tree, rather than sees it.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Node Representation:** Each node in the decision tree is assigned a unique haptic signature. This signature could be a distinct vibration pattern (frequency, amplitude, duration), a simulated texture (roughness, smoothness, pattern), or a combination of both.

2.  **Branch Indication:**  Branches emanating from a node are represented by directional haptic cues.  For example:
    *   Swipe Right:  Branch 1
    *   Swipe Left: Branch 2
    *   Long Press:  Expand Node (reveal further sub-branches)
    *   Double Tap: Return to parent node.

3.  **Initial State:** When the application reaches a decision point, the device delivers the haptic signature of the current node to the user's fingertips.

4.  **User Interaction:** The user *feels* the node and then performs a swipe gesture (direction dictated by the branch) to select a path. The haptic feedback engine confirms the selection with a different, short haptic pulse.

5.  **Dynamic Haptic Adjustment:** The intensity and complexity of the haptic signatures adapt based on user context and decision tree depth. Shallower nodes might have simpler vibrations, while deeper nodes with more branches might use more complex patterns.

6.  **Error Handling:** If an invalid gesture is detected, the device provides a distinct ‘error’ haptic cue.

7.  **Accessibility Mode:** The system incorporates an accessibility mode that allows users to customize haptic feedback strength, patterns, and gesture sensitivity to suit their individual needs.

8.  **Multi-Node Display:** The device will support haptic display of multiple nodes simultaneously, enabling complex selection and comparison of options. These simultaneous signatures will be distinct enough to allow differentiation.

**Pseudocode (Interaction Loop):**

```
function handleDecisionNode(node):
  displayHapticSignature(node.hapticSignature)
  while userHasNotMadeSelection():
    gesture = detectUserGesture()
    if gesture == "swipeRight":
      if node.hasBranch("right"):
        nextNode = node.getBranch("right")
        handleDecisionNode(nextNode)
      else:
        displayErrorHaptic()
    else if gesture == "swipeLeft":
      if node.hasBranch("left"):
        nextNode = node.getBranch("left")
        handleDecisionNode(nextNode)
      else:
        displayErrorHaptic()
    else if gesture == "longPress":
       expandNodeHaptically(node)
    else if gesture == "doubleTap":
        returnToParentNode()
    else:
      displayErrorHaptic()

function expandNodeHaptically(node):
    // Render haptic signatures for all child nodes simultaneously
    // Allow user to 'feel' the branches
function returnToParentNode():
    // Navigate to parent node in the decision tree
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Hands-Free Interaction:**  Allows navigation without requiring the user to look at the screen, useful in scenarios where visual attention is limited (e.g., driving, walking).
*   **Enhanced Accessibility:** Provides an alternative navigation method for visually impaired users.
*   **Immersive Experience:** Creates a more engaging and intuitive user experience.
*   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Minimizes the need for visual processing, freeing up cognitive resources.
