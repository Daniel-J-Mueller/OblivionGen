## Personalized Intent ‘Blending’ for Multi-Modal Content

**Concept:** Extend the intent modeling beyond discrete ‘explore’ vs. ‘action’ to a continuous ‘intent blend’ space, dynamically adjusting content presentation based on *predicted* intent drifts observed across multiple input modalities (text, image, audio, video).  This moves beyond classifying *what* the user intends and towards predicting *how* their intent is evolving in real time.

**Specs:**

*   **Multi-Modal Input:** System accepts real-time data streams from various modalities:
    *   Text: Search queries, typed input, chat logs.
    *   Image: User-uploaded images, viewed images.
    *   Audio: Voice searches, background audio analysis (mood detection).
    *   Video: Viewed videos, live video feeds (facial expression analysis).
*   **Intent Embedding Layer:** A dedicated neural network layer learns to embed each modality’s input into a high-dimensional ‘intent vector’.  These vectors are *not* intent classifications (e.g., ‘purchase’, ‘learn’), but continuous representations capturing nuanced intent states.
*   **Intent Drift Prediction:** A recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically a GRU or LSTM, processes the sequence of intent vectors from all modalities. This RNN is trained to predict *future* intent vectors based on past sequences. The *difference* between predicted and actual intent vectors represents ‘intent drift’.
*   **Content Adaptation Engine:** Based on the predicted intent drift, the system dynamically adapts content presentation in the following ways:
    *   **Content Re-ranking:** Content items are re-ranked based on their alignment with the *predicted* future intent.
    *   **Content Remixing:** For multi-part content (e.g., video series, articles with sub-sections), the order of presentation is adjusted to optimize for predicted intent.
    *   **Content Augmentation:** New content elements are dynamically added or removed to better align with predicted intent. For example, if the system predicts a shift towards ‘action’ intent, it might add a ‘call to action’ button or highlight relevant product features.
    *    **Presentation Style:** Dynamically adjust visual style, language and length of content presented.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input Streams
text_stream = get_text_stream()
image_stream = get_image_stream()
audio_stream = get_audio_stream()
video_stream = get_video_stream()

// Intent Embedding Layer
text_intent = embed(text_stream)
image_intent = embed(image_stream)
audio_intent = embed(audio_stream)
video_intent = embed(video_stream)

// Combine Modalities
combined_intent = concatenate(text_intent, image_intent, audio_intent, video_intent)

// Intent Drift Prediction (RNN)
predicted_intent = rnn(combined_intent)
drift = combined_intent - predicted_intent // Measure difference

// Content Adaptation
adapted_content = adapt_content(content_pool, drift)

// Output
display(adapted_content)
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus on classifying intent. This extends that by predicting how intent changes over time. Multi-modal integration with dynamic content adaptation based on predicted drift is novel. The system shifts from reactive intent recognition to proactive intent anticipation.  This is a move beyond simply understanding *what* a user wants and towards understanding *where* they are going.
