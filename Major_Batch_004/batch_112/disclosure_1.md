## Adaptive Data Prefetching based on Predictive Access Patterns

**Specification:** Implement a system that dynamically predicts object access patterns at the object gateway level and prefetches data accordingly, leveraging machine learning models trained on historical access data. This goes beyond simple caching by proactively retrieving data *before* it is requested, significantly reducing latency for frequently accessed data and improving overall system responsiveness.

**Components:**

*   **Access Pattern Analyzer (APA):** A module within the object gateway responsible for monitoring and analyzing object access requests. It tracks which objects are requested, the frequency of requests, the time intervals between requests, and the compute instances making the requests.
*   **Predictive Model Trainer (PMT):** A separate service (possibly cloud-based) that receives historical access data from multiple object gateways. It utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., recurrent neural networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks) to build and refine predictive models for each object store and even individual compute instances. The models predict the probability of a specific object being requested within a given time window.
*   **Prefetching Engine (PE):** Resides within the object gateway. It receives predictions from the PMT and initiates prefetch requests to the object store for objects with a high probability of being accessed. It maintains a prefetch queue and manages the concurrency of prefetch operations.
*   **Prefetch Cache (PFC):** A dedicated cache within the object gateway specifically for prefetched data. It has a separate eviction policy optimized for predictive data (e.g., Least Recently Predicted).
*   **Feedback Loop:** Monitors the accuracy of predictions (hit rate of prefetched data) and feeds this information back to the PMT to improve model training.

**Operation:**

1.  The APA continuously monitors object access requests and logs relevant data (object ID, timestamp, requester ID).
2.  This data is periodically sent to the PMT.
3.  The PMT trains machine learning models to predict future object access patterns.
4.  The PMT sends the trained models to the object gateways.
5.  The PE uses the model to predict which objects will be requested.
6.  For objects with a high prediction score, the PE initiates a prefetch request.
7.  Prefetched data is stored in the PFC.
8.  When a compute instance requests an object, the object gateway first checks the PFC. If the object is found, it is served immediately from the PFC. Otherwise, it is retrieved from the object store.
9.  The feedback loop monitors the hit rate of the PFC and provides data to the PMT for model refinement.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Engine):**

```pseudocode
function handle_request(object_id, requester_id):
  if object_id in prefetch_cache:
    return prefetch_cache[object_id]
  else:
    object_data = fetch_from_object_store(object_id)
    prefetch_cache[object_id] = object_data
    return object_data

function prefetch_loop():
  while True:
    predictions = get_predictions_from_pmt(requester_id)
    for prediction in predictions:
      object_id = prediction.object_id
      probability = prediction.probability
      if probability > PREFETCH_THRESHOLD:
        if object_id not in prefetch_cache:
          # Asynchronously fetch object
          start_prefetch(object_id)
    sleep(PREFETCH_INTERVAL)

function start_prefetch(object_id):
  # Fetch object from object store (using a worker thread)
  object_data = fetch_from_object_store(object_id)
  # Store in prefetch cache
  prefetch_cache[object_id] = object_data
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   `PREFETCH_THRESHOLD`: The minimum prediction probability required to initiate a prefetch request.
*   `PREFETCH_INTERVAL`: The frequency at which the prefetch loop is executed.
*   `MAX_PREFETCH_CONCURRENCY`: The maximum number of concurrent prefetch requests.
*   `PREFETCH_CACHE_SIZE`: The maximum size of the prefetch cache.
*   `MODEL_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: The frequency at which the object gateway requests a new predictive model from the PMT.
