## Dynamic Watermarking via Perceptual Hash Drift

**Concept:** Embed covert, dynamic watermarks within image/document data by subtly altering perceptual hashes over time. Instead of static embedding, the watermark *evolves* based on a key/timestamp, making it significantly more resistant to removal and detection.

**Specifications:**

**1. Perceptual Hash Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Image/Document Data (any supported format).
*   **Process:**
    *   Resize input to a standard size (e.g., 256x256).
    *   Convert to grayscale.
    *   Apply Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).
    *   Extract a subset of low-frequency DCT coefficients (e.g., top 8x8).
    *   Calculate a hash value from the extracted coefficients. (e.g., using a simple bitwise XOR operation or a more complex cryptographic hash function). This is the 'base hash'.
*   **Output:** Base Perceptual Hash (e.g., 64-bit hexadecimal string).

**2. Watermark Encoding Module:**

*   **Input:** Base Perceptual Hash, Watermark Data (e.g., timestamp, user ID, device ID), Watermark Key.
*   **Process:**
    *   Generate a 'drift vector' based on the Watermark Data and Key.  This vector represents the desired changes to the base hash. The drift vector could be generated using a pseudorandom number generator seeded with the Key and Data.
    *   Apply the drift vector to the base hash.  This could involve adding/subtracting values from specific bits or applying a bitwise operation. The magnitude of the drift should be small enough to remain perceptually invisible.
    *   Reconstruct the image/document data using the modified hash. This will involve an inverse DCT and a reconstruction process.
*   **Output:** Watermarked Image/Document Data.

**3. Watermark Decoding Module:**

*   **Input:** Watermarked Image/Document Data, Watermark Key.
*   **Process:**
    *   Generate the base perceptual hash from the watermarked data.
    *   Using the Key, regenerate the expected drift vector.
    *   Subtract the drift vector from the generated hash.
    *   Extract the embedded watermark data from the resulting hash.
*   **Output:** Extracted Watermark Data.

**4. Perceptual Invisibility & Robustness Enhancements:**

*   **Adaptive Drift Magnitude:**  Dynamically adjust the magnitude of the drift vector based on the local image/document content.  Smooth regions can tolerate larger drifts than highly detailed areas.
*   **Frequency Masking:** Apply a frequency-domain mask to the drift vector to concentrate changes in less sensitive frequency bands.
*   **Error Correction Coding:**  Encode the watermark data using an error correction code (e.g., Reed-Solomon) to improve robustness against noise and distortions.
*   **Key Management:** Securely store and manage the Watermark Key.

**Pseudocode (Watermark Encoding):**

```
function encode_watermark(image_data, watermark_data, watermark_key):
  base_hash = generate_perceptual_hash(image_data)
  drift_vector = generate_drift_vector(watermark_data, watermark_key)
  modified_hash = base_hash + drift_vector  // Apply drift
  reconstructed_image = reconstruct_image_from_hash(modified_hash)
  return reconstructed_image
```

**Novelty:** Unlike traditional watermarking which embeds fixed patterns, this system creates a dynamically evolving watermark, making it far more resistant to removal techniques. The use of perceptual hash drift, combined with adaptive drift magnitude and error correction coding, maximizes both invisibility and robustness.
