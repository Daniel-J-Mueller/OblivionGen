## Dynamic Behavioral Weighting based on Contextual Drift

**Concept:** Extend the seed behavior filtering by introducing a dynamic weighting system that adjusts the influence of historical behavior based on detected *contextual drift*. The original patent focuses on filtering based on purchase category and time. This builds on that by recognizing that user preferences *within* a category can shift over time, and historical behavior reflecting older preferences should be down-weighted accordingly.

**Specs:**

1.  **Contextual Feature Extraction:**
    *   Define a set of contextual features for each item category (e.g., TV: screen size, resolution, smart features, price range).
    *   Continuously monitor user interactions (views, clicks, purchases) with items, extracting these contextual features.
    *   Maintain a rolling window of contextual feature distributions for each user *within* each category.

2.  **Drift Detection:**
    *   Employ a drift detection algorithm (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Chi-Squared test) to compare the current contextual feature distribution with a baseline distribution (e.g., the distribution from a week/month prior, or the user’s initial preference profile).
    *   Calculate a “drift score” for each contextual feature and aggregate these into an overall “contextual drift score” for the category. A high drift score indicates significant preference change.

3.  **Behavioral Weighting:**
    *   Assign weights to historical seed behaviors based on their age and the contextual drift score.
    *   Older behaviors receive lower weights.
    *   Behaviors occurring during periods of high contextual drift receive even lower weights (exponential decay function, where the decay rate is proportional to the drift score).
    *   Recent behaviors (within a defined window) receive the highest weights.

4.  **Recommendation Generation:**
    *   During recommendation generation, calculate a weighted score for each item based on the user’s seed behaviors.
    *   The weighted score is the sum of (behavior score * behavior weight) for all relevant seed behaviors.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//For each user and item category:

// 1. Extract Contextual Features from User Interactions
features = ExtractFeatures(user_interactions, category)

// 2. Detect Drift
drift_score = DetectDrift(features, baseline_features)

// 3. Calculate Behavior Weights
for each seed_behavior in user_seed_behaviors:
    age = current_time - seed_behavior_time
    weight = CalculateWeight(age, drift_score) //weight decreases with age and drift

// 4. Calculate Item Score
item_score = 0
for each seed_behavior in user_seed_behaviors:
    behavior_score = GetBehaviorScore(seed_behavior, item)
    item_score += behavior_score * weight

//Sort items by item_score and recommend top N
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ContextualFeatureDistribution`:  A vector representing the frequency of each contextual feature (e.g., screen size 55", 65", 75").
*   `SeedBehavior`: Contains information about a user interaction (item ID, timestamp, category, contextual features).
*   `UserPreferenceProfile`: Stores the user’s baseline contextual feature distributions for each category.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Personalized Drift Detection Thresholds:**  Adapt the drift detection sensitivity based on the user's interaction frequency.  Active users may exhibit faster preference shifts.
*   **Multi-Category Drift Awareness:**  Model dependencies between categories. A shift in preference for TVs might influence preferences for sound systems.
*   **External Contextual Factors:** Integrate external data (e.g., seasonality, trending products) to further refine the drift detection and weighting.
