## Predictive Anomaly Contextualization with Temporal Graph Embedding

**Concept:** Extend the anomaly aggregation framework by dynamically building a temporal graph representing relationships *between* anomalous events, and then use graph embeddings to predict potential future anomalies based on evolving contextual patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Graph Construction:**

*   **Input:**  The existing log anomaly instances (type, event, timestamp, optional event type ID) are the primary input.
*   **Node Creation:** Each unique anomalous log event (combination of event and type) becomes a node in the temporal graph.
*   **Edge Creation:** Edges are created between nodes based on temporal proximity.  A configurable time window (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour) defines proximity. Edge weight represents the frequency of co-occurrence within that window.  Edges are directional, from earlier to later event.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** The graph is updated in near real-time as new log anomaly instances are detected.  Old edges (beyond a configurable retention period) are removed.

**2. Graph Embedding Generation:**

*   **Embedding Model:** Employ a temporal graph embedding technique (e.g., DySAT, TGN) to generate vector representations (embeddings) for each node in the graph. These embeddings capture the node's position within the temporal network of anomalies.
*   **Embedding Dimensionality:** Configurable embedding dimensionality (e.g., 64, 128, 256) based on computational resources and desired granularity.
*   **Periodic Retraining:** The embedding model is periodically retrained (e.g., every hour, every day) using the updated graph to adapt to evolving anomaly patterns.

**3. Anomaly Prediction & Scoring:**

*   **Similarity Search:** For a newly detected log anomaly instance, find the *k* most similar nodes in the graph (based on cosine similarity of their embeddings).
*   **Predictive Scoring:** Assign a predictive score to the new instance based on the scores of its nearest neighbors. The score can be a weighted average of neighbor scores.  Higher scores indicate a higher probability of future anomalous activity.
*   **Contextual Enrichment:** Augment the initial anomaly instance with information from its nearest neighbors (e.g., associated log anomaly types, event type IDs) to provide richer contextual awareness.

**4. Alerting & Visualization:**

*   **Threshold-Based Alerting:**  Configure thresholds on the predictive score to trigger alerts when anomalies are likely to escalate or lead to cascading failures.
*   **Anomaly Graph Visualization:**  Display the temporal graph in a user-friendly interface, allowing users to explore relationships between anomalies and identify potential root causes.

**Pseudocode:**

```
# Function: Generate Graph Embeddings
def generate_graph_embeddings(graph):
    # Use DySAT or TGN model
    embedding_model = load_model("DySAT")  # Or TGN
    embeddings = embedding_model.embed(graph)
    return embeddings

# Function: Predict Anomaly Score
def predict_anomaly_score(new_anomaly, graph, embeddings, k=5):
    # Find k nearest neighbors in embedding space
    neighbors = find_k_nearest_neighbors(new_anomaly, embeddings, k)
    # Calculate weighted average of neighbor scores
    score = calculate_weighted_average(neighbors)
    return score
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Sufficient memory to store the temporal graph and embeddings.
*   GPU acceleration for embedding model training and inference.
*   Graph database (e.g., Neo4j, JanusGraph) for efficient graph storage and retrieval.
*   Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
