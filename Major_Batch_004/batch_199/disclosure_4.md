## Adaptive Test Prioritization via Developer “Reputation NFTs”

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting test suite execution based on a developer’s “Reputation NFT” – a non-fungible token reflecting their historical code quality and reliability. This moves beyond simple trust *levels* and introduces a verifiable, transparent reputation system.

**Components:**

1.  **Reputation NFT Contract:** A smart contract (Ethereum or similar) that mints and manages Reputation NFTs for each developer/development entity.

    *   NFT metadata: Includes baseline quality scores (initially assigned based on external factors, like code review history or previous application performance), a ‘decay’ factor (reflecting the age of positive performance), and a scoring mechanism.
    *   Scoring Mechanism: Driven by a combination of factors:
        *   Post-release bug reports (weighted by severity).
        *   Automated code quality analysis scores (static analysis, linting, etc.).
        *   User feedback (app store reviews, in-app surveys).
        *   Successful test passes on submissions *within* this cycle.
    *   Decay Factor:  Gradually reduces the NFT score over time if no new positive data is received, encouraging continuous quality improvement.

2.  **Test Prioritization Engine:**  Integrated into the application test system.

    *   Input:  Receives the application, the developer’s Reputation NFT, and standard application metadata.
    *   Logic:
        1.  **NFT Score Parsing:** Extracts the current reputation score from the Reputation NFT.
        2.  **Test Suite Segmentation:** The test suite is pre-segmented into tiers:
            *   **Tier 0 (Critical):**  Essential functionality, security checks – *always* executed.
            *   **Tier 1 (Standard):**  Core functionality, performance tests – executed based on NFT score > threshold A.
            *   **Tier 2 (Extended):**  Edge cases, complex scenarios, advanced features – executed based on NFT score > threshold B (B > A).
            *   **Tier 3 (Exploratory):**  Fuzz testing, stress testing, automated UI exploration – executed based on NFT score > threshold C (C > B) *and* available resources.
        3.  **Dynamic Test Selection:**  Based on the NFT score, the engine dynamically selects which tiers of tests to execute.  Higher scores unlock more comprehensive testing.
        4.  **Feedback Loop:** Test results (pass/fail) *directly update* the developer’s Reputation NFT score through the smart contract, creating a continuous improvement cycle.  Failures incur penalties; successes grant rewards.
        5.  **Resource Allocation:** If available resources are constrained, the engine prioritizes testing applications from developers with higher Reputation NFT scores, maximizing the value of testing efforts.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function select_tests(application, developer_nft) {
  nft_score = get_nft_score(developer_nft);
  tier_0_tests = get_tier_0_tests(application); // Always run
  execute_tests(tier_0_tests);

  if (nft_score > threshold_A) {
    tier_1_tests = get_tier_1_tests(application);
    execute_tests(tier_1_tests);
  }

  if (nft_score > threshold_B) {
    tier_2_tests = get_tier_2_tests(application);
    execute_tests(tier_2_tests);
  }

  if (nft_score > threshold_C && resources_available()) {
    tier_3_tests = get_tier_3_tests(application);
    execute_tests(tier_3_tests);
  }

  update_nft_score(developer_nft, test_results);
}
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Verifiable Reputation:** NFT-based reputation is transparent and tamper-proof.
*   **Incentivized Quality:**  Developers are directly incentivized to produce high-quality code.
*   **Dynamic Testing:** Testing efforts are dynamically adjusted based on developer reputation.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Testing resources are allocated more efficiently.
*   **Gamification:** Introduces a gamified element to the development process.
