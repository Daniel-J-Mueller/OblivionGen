**Adaptive Environmental Sonification System**

**Core Concept:** Extend the motion-based security system to incorporate environmental audio analysis and create a dynamic, localized soundscape reflecting the *likelihood* of intrusion, rather than simply triggering an alarm. This transitions security from reactive to proactive, and leverages human perceptual abilities beyond simple alerts.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sensor Integration:** Integrate existing motion sensors with a network of distributed microphones. Microphones should be capable of recording and analyzing ambient sound.

2.  **Baseline Audio Profile:** System continuously learns the baseline audio profile of each sensor zone (e.g., living room, backyard). This includes identifying typical sounds (speech, TV, birdsong, traffic) and their frequency/intensity characteristics.  Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) for time-series audio analysis.

3.  **Anomaly Detection:**  Develop an anomaly detection algorithm. This isn’t just detecting *sound*, but detecting sounds *outside* the established baseline profile for that zone.  Use a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn the probability distribution of normal sounds; deviations indicate anomalies.

4.  **Localized Soundscape Generation:**  When an anomaly is detected *and* corroborated by motion sensor data, the system doesn’t trigger an alarm *immediately*. Instead, it generates a subtle, localized soundscape designed to increase alertness *without* causing panic. This soundscape is derived from:
    *   **Anomaly Characteristics:** Analyze the anomalous sound.  Is it a scraping noise?  A muffled voice?  This informs the sonic texture.
    *   **Zone Context:**  The soundscape adapts to the location.  A scraping noise in the backyard might be subtly overlaid with amplified insect sounds. A muffled voice near a window might incorporate a faint, distorted echo.
    *   **"Threat Level" Mapping:** Assign a 'threat level' based on the correlation of anomaly + motion. Low threat = subtle environmental augmentation. High threat = more pronounced, potentially dissonant sounds.
5.  **Dynamic Granularity:** Soundscape detail scales with threat.
    *   **Level 1 (Low Threat):** Subtle shifts in ambient sounds.  Slightly enhanced bird song, gentle wind chimes, increased room tone.
    *   **Level 2 (Medium Threat):** Introduction of dissonant tones masked within the environment. A low hum beneath music, a faint static in the room tone.
    *   **Level 3 (High Threat):**  Distinct, yet abstract sonic events. A rhythmic, pulsing sound, a distorted echo, a high-frequency tone. Alarm is only triggered if Level 3 persists for a defined period, or if multiple zones simultaneously report Level 3 events.
6.  **User Customization:** Allow users to customize the sonic palette for each zone. Users can select preferred sounds (nature sounds, ambient music, etc.) and adjust the intensity and sensitivity of the system.
7.  **AI Learning:** System continuously learns from user feedback. If a user consistently dismisses a particular sound as a false alarm, the system adjusts its sensitivity for that sound and location.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection + Soundscape Generation):**

```
// For each sensor zone:
LEARN_BASELINE_AUDIO_PROFILE(zone)  // RNN, VAE training
// While monitoring:
audio_data = RECORD_AUDIO(zone)
anomaly_score = DETECT_AUDIO_ANOMALY(audio_data, baseline_profile)
motion_detected = READ_MOTION_SENSOR(zone)
IF motion_detected AND anomaly_score > threshold:
  threat_level = CALCULATE_THREAT_LEVEL(anomaly_score, motion_intensity)
  soundscape = GENERATE_SOUNDSCAPE(threat_level, zone_context, user_preferences)
  PLAY_SOUNDSCAPE(soundscape)
  IF threat_level remains high for duration OR multiple zones trigger:
     TRIGGER_ALARM()
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Integration with smart home devices (lights, speakers) for more immersive soundscape generation.
*   Facial recognition integration – tailor soundscapes based on identified individuals.
*   Predictive analysis - use historical data to anticipate potential threats and proactively adjust soundscapes.
