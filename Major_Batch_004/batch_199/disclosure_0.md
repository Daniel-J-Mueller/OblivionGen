## Personalized Sentiment-Driven Item Discovery via Temporal Review Weighting

**Concept:** Expand beyond static sentiment analysis of reviews to incorporate a *temporal* weighting system. Recognize that customer sentiment regarding a product *changes* over time due to updates, defects discovered, competitor offerings, or seasonal trends.  The system will dynamically adjust phrase ranking not only by polarity (subjectivity/sentiment) but also by the recency of reviews contributing to that polarity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Temporal Tagging:**

*   **Review Timestamping:** All customer reviews must be ingested with precise timestamps.
*   **Version Tracking:**  Associate each review with the *product version* (if applicable – software, revised hardware iterations).  If no explicit versioning, infer from review dates relative to known release dates.
*   **Rolling Time Windows:** Define configurable rolling time windows (e.g., 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year).

**2. Dynamic Polarity Calculation:**

*   **Baseline Polarity:** Calculate initial phrase polarity (subjectivity & sentiment) as per the original patent, using existing methods.
*   **Temporal Decay Function:** Implement a decay function that reduces the weight of older reviews in the polarity calculation.  The decay rate is configurable per time window.  Example: `weight = e^(-k * (current_time - review_time))`, where `k` is a configurable decay constant.  Experiment with linear, exponential, and sigmoid decay functions.
*   **Version-Specific Weighting:** If versioning is available, apply weighting *within* each version. This ensures that issues with older versions do not unduly influence sentiment regarding current versions.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Monitor for significant sentiment shifts within time windows.  Flag anomalies for human review and potential alerts. (e.g., a sudden increase in negative sentiment for a previously well-reviewed item).

**3. Phrase Ranking & Suggestion Engine:**

*   **Weighted Polarity Score:**  Calculate a new phrase ranking score based on the *weighted* polarity (considering temporal decay).
*   **Personalized Temporal Profiles:** Store individual user’s review history and preferences. Adjust decay rates *per user* based on their review activity (e.g., more recent reviews carry more weight for active reviewers).
*   **Multi-Level Filtering:**
    *   **Browse Node Association:** As per the original patent.
    *   **Temporal Relevance:** Filter phrases based on the recency of contributing reviews.  (e.g., only show phrases from reviews within the last 30 days).
    *   **Personalized Preference:**  Prioritize phrases aligning with the user’s past positive/negative sentiment.

**4.  System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
Class ReviewProcessor:
    def __init__(self, decay_constant, time_window):
        self.decay_constant = decay_constant
        self.time_window = time_window

    def calculate_weighted_polarity(self, phrase, reviews):
        total_weight = 0
        weighted_sentiment = 0
        for review in reviews:
            if (current_time - review.timestamp) <= self.time_window:
                weight = exp(-self.decay_constant * (current_time - review.timestamp))
                weighted_sentiment += weight * review.sentiment_score
                total_weight += weight
        if total_weight > 0:
            return weighted_sentiment / total_weight
        else:
            return 0  # or default sentiment

Class PhraseRanker:
    def __init__(self, review_processor):
        self.review_processor = review_processor

    def rank_phrases(self, phrase_list, item_reviews, user_history):
        ranked_phrases = []
        for phrase in phrase_list:
            weighted_polarity = self.review_processor.calculate_weighted_polarity(phrase, item_reviews)
            # Incorporate user history/preference to adjust weighted_polarity
            ranked_phrases.append((phrase, weighted_polarity))
        ranked_phrases.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        return ranked_phrases

# Example usage
review_processor = ReviewProcessor(decay_constant=0.01, time_window=30 * 24 * 60 * 60) # 30 days in seconds
phrase_ranker = PhraseRanker(review_processor)
ranked_phrases = phrase_ranker.rank_phrases(phrase_list, item_reviews, user_history)
# Use ranked_phrases for auto-complete/suggestions
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **External Event Correlation:** Integrate external event data (e.g., news articles, social media trends) to adjust phrase weights. A negative news story might temporarily decrease the weight of positive phrases.
*   **A/B Testing:** Continuously A/B test different decay functions and weighting schemes to optimize suggestion relevance and user engagement.
*   **Explainable AI:** Provide users with transparency into *why* a particular phrase is being suggested, highlighting the recent reviews that contributed to its ranking.
