## Dynamic Error Pattern Synthesis & Predictive Code Analysis

**Concept:** Expand beyond static error pattern identification (based on geographic location/execution errors) to *synthesize* novel error patterns based on code dependencies and predicted runtime behavior. This anticipates potential issues *before* they manifest, shifting from reactive analysis to proactive prevention.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Dependency Graph Generator (DGG):** Analyzes the scanned code to construct a dependency graph. Nodes represent functions, classes, or modules. Edges represent calls, inheritance, or data flow.  This will use existing static analysis techniques as a base, but will *extend* it.
*   **Runtime Behavior Predictor (RBP):**  Uses machine learning (specifically, graph neural networks trained on a corpus of code execution traces) to predict likely runtime behavior given the dependency graph.  It predicts potential bottlenecks, resource contention, or anomalous data flows.  This will require an offline pre-training phase with substantial data.
*   **Error Pattern Synthesizer (EPS):** Based on the RBP’s predicted runtime behavior, the EPS generates hypothetical error patterns.  These are *not* based on observed errors, but on predicted *potential* errors. The EPS will use techniques like fuzzing to create input conditions to specifically trigger the predicted vulnerabilities.
*   **Weighted Risk Assessment (WRA):** Assigns a risk score to each synthesized error pattern based on factors like complexity of the triggering condition, potential impact of the vulnerability, and confidence level of the RBP’s prediction.
*   **Adaptive Scanning Engine (ASE):** Integrates the synthesized error patterns into the scanning process.  The ASE dynamically adjusts the scanning intensity and focuses on areas of the code with the highest risk scores.

**II. Pseudocode (ASE – Core Scanning Loop):**

```pseudocode
function ScanCode(code, projectID) {
  dependencyGraph = GenerateDependencyGraph(code);
  predictedBehavior = PredictRuntimeBehavior(dependencyGraph);
  synthesizedPatterns = SynthesizeErrorPatterns(predictedBehavior);
  riskScores = CalculateRiskScores(synthesizedPatterns);

  scanConfig = GenerateScanConfiguration(riskScores); // Config defines scan intensity per module

  scanResults = PerformScan(code, scanConfig);

  // Existing static analysis pass (as in original patent)

  mergedResults = MergeResults(scanResults, staticAnalysisResults);

  return mergedResults;
}

function GenerateScanConfiguration(riskScores) {
  // Weighted scan intensity based on risk scores
  // High risk modules get more thorough scanning
  // Modules with low risk get minimal scanning
  configuration = {};
  for (module, score in riskScores) {
    configuration[module] = MapRiskScoreToScanIntensity(score);
  }
  return configuration;
}
```

**III. Data Structures:**

*   **Dependency Graph:**  Adjacency list or matrix representing code dependencies.  Node attributes: Function name, class name, module name, code complexity. Edge attributes: Call type, data flow direction, data type.
*   **Runtime Behavior Prediction:** Probability distribution over potential runtime states.  Represented as a vector of probabilities, each corresponding to a specific state.
*   **Error Pattern:**  Representation of a potential vulnerability.  Attributes: Vulnerability type, triggering condition, affected code location, severity level.
*   **Risk Score:** Numerical value representing the likelihood and impact of a vulnerability.

**IV. Novelty & Differentiation:**

*   **Proactive vs. Reactive:**  Shifts from detecting existing errors to *predicting* potential errors.
*   **Behavior-Driven Analysis:**  Uses runtime behavior prediction to guide the scanning process.
*   **Dynamic Scan Configuration:** Adapts the scanning intensity based on the predicted risk.
*   **Addresses Unknown Vulnerabilities:**  Can identify vulnerabilities that are not covered by existing static analysis rules.
