## Dynamic Reference Frame Weighting via Perceptual Hashing

**Specification:** A system for dynamically weighting reference frames during video encoding based on perceptual similarity to the current frame, leveraging a perceptual hash algorithm.

**Core Concept:** Existing inter-prediction techniques often treat all valid reference frames equally or apply simple temporal weighting. This system introduces a perceptual weighting scheme where each candidate reference frame is assessed for its *perceptual* similarity to the current frame.  Higher similarity yields a higher weighting factor in the prediction process.  This allows the encoder to prioritize reference frames that *look* more like the current frame, potentially improving compression efficiency and perceived quality.

**Components:**

1.  **Perceptual Hash Generator:**  An algorithm (e.g., dHash, pHash, wHash) operates on both the current frame and each candidate reference frame. The output is a perceptual hash value for each frame.

2.  **Similarity Metric:**  A function calculates the Hamming distance (or other suitable metric) between the hash of the current frame and the hash of each reference frame.  Lower Hamming distance indicates higher perceptual similarity.

3.  **Weighting Function:**  A function maps the Hamming distance to a weighting factor between 0 and 1.  Example: `weight = 1 / (1 + exp(HammingDistance / k))`, where `k` is a tunable parameter controlling the sensitivity of the weighting.

4.  **Prediction Engine:** The encoding process utilizes weighted prediction.  Instead of a simple average of predictions from multiple reference frames, each prediction is multiplied by its corresponding weight before being combined.

**Pseudocode (Encoding):**

```
function EncodeFrame(currentFrame, referenceFrames):
  // 1. Generate perceptual hashes for current frame and each reference frame
  currentHash = GeneratePerceptualHash(currentFrame)
  referenceHashes = [GeneratePerceptualHash(rf) for rf in referenceFrames]

  // 2. Calculate similarity scores
  similarityScores = [CalculateHammingDistance(currentHash, rfHash) for rfHash in referenceHashes]

  // 3. Calculate weights
  weights = [1 / (1 + exp(score / k)) for score in similarityScores] // k is a tuning parameter

  // 4. Perform weighted prediction
  weightedPredictions = []
  for i in range(len(referenceFrames)):
    prediction = Predict(currentFrame, referenceFrames[i]) // Existing prediction algorithm
    weightedPrediction = prediction * weights[i]
    weightedPredictions.append(weightedPrediction)

  // 5. Combine weighted predictions
  combinedPrediction = sum(weightedPredictions)

  // 6. Encode residual (difference between current frame and combined prediction)
  residual = currentFrame - combinedPrediction
  encodedResidual = Encode(residual)

  return encodedResidual
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `PerceptualHash`: Array of integers representing the hash value.
*   `SimilarityScore`: Floating-point number representing the similarity.
*   `Weight`: Floating-point number between 0 and 1.

**Tunable Parameters:**

*   `k`: Sensitivity parameter for the weighting function.
*   Hash Algorithm: Choice of perceptual hash algorithm (dHash, pHash, wHash, etc.)
*   Hash Size: Size of the perceptual hash.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved compression efficiency by prioritizing perceptually relevant reference frames.
*   Enhanced perceived quality by reducing artifacts caused by irrelevant reference frames.
*   Adaptability to different video content and encoding conditions.
*   Potential for reducing encoding complexity by discarding low-weight reference frames.
