## Dynamic Payload Segmentation & Adaptive Retransmission

**Concept:** Extend the three-packet handshake to support dynamic payload segmentation and adaptive retransmission based on real-time network condition analysis. The existing protocol appears to focus on reliable delivery of a single request/response. This expands that to handle larger, variable-sized data streams efficiently.

**Specs:**

**1. Payload Segmentation Module:**

*   **Function:** Divides application data into segments sized dynamically based on current network conditions (RTT, packet loss rate, MTU discovery).
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   Initial segment size:  `BaseSegmentSize` (configurable, e.g., 1KB).
    *   RTT Measurement: Continuously measure Round Trip Time (RTT) between nodes.
    *   Packet Loss Rate Estimation: Track packet loss over a sliding window.
    *   Segment Size Adjustment:
        *   If RTT increases or packet loss exceeds a threshold:  `SegmentSize = SegmentSize * ReductionFactor` (e.g., 0.5).
        *   If RTT decreases and packet loss is low: `SegmentSize = SegmentSize * GrowthFactor` (e.g., 1.2).
        *   Ensure `SegmentSize` remains within MTU bounds.
*   **Metadata:** Each segment includes:
    *   Segment ID (sequential).
    *   Total Segments.
    *   Unique Identifier (from existing protocol).
    *   Checksum/CRC for data integrity.

**2. Extended Handshake (Modified Three-Packet Exchange):**

*   **Packet 1 (Initial):**
    *   Unique Identifier.
    *   Initial Segment ID (0).
    *   Total Segments.
    *   Initial Segment Data.
    *   Network Condition Report (Initial RTT, MTU probe result, estimated bandwidth).
*   **Packet 2 (Acknowledgement & Feedback):**
    *   Unique Identifier.
    *   Acknowledged Segment ID.
    *   Network Condition Report (Updated RTT, packet loss, estimated bandwidth).
    *   Request for Segment Count (Number of segments the receiver can buffer).
    *   Buffer Availability Report (Percentage of available buffer space).
*   **Packet 3 (Data/Acknowledgement):**
    *   Unique Identifier.
    *   Segment ID.
    *   Segment Data.
    *   Acknowledgement (Acknowledged Segment ID).

**3. Adaptive Retransmission Protocol:**

*   **Retransmission Timer:** Per-segment timer.
*   **Timer Value:** Dynamically adjusted based on RTT and packet loss.
    *   `RetransmissionTimeout = RTT * (1 + PacketLossRate * Multiplier)`
*   **Selective Acknowledgement (SACK):** Receiver acknowledges specific segments received, enabling retransmission of only missing segments.
*   **Congestion Control:** Implement a simple congestion control mechanism:
    *   If multiple segments are repeatedly lost, reduce transmission rate.
    *   If acknowledgements are consistently received, increase transmission rate.

**4.  Buffer Management:**

*   Receiver maintains a buffer to store incoming segments.
*   Buffer size is dynamically adjusted based on application requirements and available resources.
*   Buffer overflow is prevented by limiting the number of outstanding unacknowledged segments.

**Pseudocode (Sender):**

```
function sendData(data):
  segmentSize = baseSegmentSize
  segments = segmentData(data, segmentSize)
  totalSegments = length(segments)

  for i in range(totalSegments):
    segment = segments[i]
    sendPacket1(segment, i, totalSegments, segmentSize)
    waitForAcknowledgement(i)
  end for
end function
```

**Pseudocode (Receiver):**

```
function receiveData():
  data = []
  while (not all segments received):
    packet = receivePacket()
    segmentId = packet.segmentId
    if (segmentId == expectedSegmentId):
      data.append(packet.segmentData)
      sendAcknowledgement(segmentId)
      expectedSegmentId++
    else:
      // Handle out-of-order segments or retransmissions
    end if
  end while
  return data
end function
```

This extends the core reliability mechanism to support streaming data, adapting to changing network conditions for optimal throughput. It leverages the existing unique identifier for maintaining context and managing the stream.
