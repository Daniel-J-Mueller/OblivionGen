## Temporal Data Reconstruction

**Specification:** Implement a system capable of reconstructing a data item's state *not just* at the point of conditional failure, but at *any* point in its history, leveraging a background process of immutable snapshotting.

**Rationale:** The core patent focuses on identifying the *immediate* cause of a failed conditional write.  However, understanding *how* the data reached that failed state – its evolution – can be immensely valuable for debugging, auditing, or even predictive analysis.  This system goes beyond “what was wrong” to “how did it get that way?”

**Components:**

*   **Immutable Snapshotter:** A background service that periodically (or on specific events, like commits) creates immutable snapshots of data items. Snapshots are versioned and stored separately from the primary data store. Storage should be cost-optimized (e.g., object storage).
*   **Temporal Query Interface:**  An extension to the existing transaction interface.  This allows a client to request the state of a data item *at a specific timestamp* or *version*.  The interface leverages the Immutable Snapshotter.
*   **Failure Context Enricher:**  When a conditional write fails (as per the original patent), the error response *automatically* includes a link to the temporal query interface pre-populated with a suggested time range (e.g., "View history around failure time").

**Pseudocode (Temporal Query):**

```
function GetItemStateAtTime(itemId, timestamp):
  // Query the Immutable Snapshotter for the latest snapshot 
  // with a timestamp <= requested timestamp
  snapshot = ImmutableSnapshotter.GetSnapshot(itemId, timestamp)

  if snapshot == null:
    // No snapshot exists for that time.  Return an error or 
    // the closest available snapshot.
    return Error("No snapshot found")

  // Reconstruct the item state from the snapshot.
  itemState = snapshot.ReconstructItemState()
  return itemState
```

**Pseudocode (Failure Context Enrichment):**

```
function HandleConditionalWriteFailure(request, failureData):
  // Original error handling logic...

  // Calculate a suggested time range for historical analysis 
  // (e.g., 5 minutes before failure time).
  startTime = failureTime - 5 minutes
  endTime = failureTime

  // Construct a URL for the Temporal Query Interface, 
  // pre-populated with the item ID and time range.
  temporalQueryUrl = GenerateTemporalQueryUrl(itemId, startTime, endTime)

  // Add the URL to the error response.
  errorResponse.AddLink("Historical Analysis", temporalQueryUrl)

  return errorResponse
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Snapshot:**  Contains a complete, immutable representation of a data item at a specific point in time.  Could be a serialized object or a set of key-value pairs.
*   **Snapshot Metadata:**  Stores information about each snapshot, such as timestamp, version number, and data item ID.

**Considerations:**

*   **Storage Costs:**  Immutable snapshots can consume significant storage space.  Data retention policies and compression techniques are essential.
*   **Query Performance:**  Retrieving snapshots from a large archive can be slow.  Caching and indexing strategies are crucial.
*   **Data Consistency:**  Ensure that snapshots are consistent with the primary data store.  Consider using transactional snapshotting.
*   **Integration with existing monitoring/observability tools.** This enables correlation of historical data with real-time events.
