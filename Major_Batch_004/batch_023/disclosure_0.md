## Dynamic Key Rotation via Biometric-Triggered Re-Encryption

**Concept:** Leverage biometric authentication *after* initial secure data encryption to dynamically rotate encryption keys, enhancing security against compromised keys or devices. This builds on the random key generation concept in the provided patent, but focuses on *ongoing* key management.

**Specifications:**

**1. Biometric Enrollment & Binding:**

*   **Process:** During initial setup, the client device captures and securely stores a biometric template (fingerprint, facial scan, voiceprint) associated with the user. This template *never* leaves the device.
*   **Binding:** The biometric template is cryptographically bound to the initial random encryption key. This binding ensures that successful biometric authentication is *required* to access or rotate the key.

**2. Key Rotation Mechanism:**

*   **Trigger:** Key rotation is initiated by either a scheduled interval *or* a user-defined event (e.g., device unlocking, app launch).
*   **Biometric Authentication:** Upon trigger, the device prompts for biometric authentication.
*   **New Key Generation:** If authentication succeeds, a *new* random encryption key is generated.
*   **Re-Encryption:** All locally-stored encrypted data is re-encrypted using the *new* key.  The old key is then securely overwritten or deleted.
*   **Key Wrapping:**  The new key is wrapped using a key-encrypting key, derived (as in the patent) using a PRF and potentially a server-provided challenge for added security.

**3. Server Interaction (Optional, for Enhanced Security):**

*   **Challenge/Response:** The server can issue a random challenge during key rotation. The client device incorporates this challenge into the PRF calculation when deriving the key-encrypting key.  This mitigates replay attacks.
*   **Key Attestation:** The client device can cryptographically attest to the server that a new key has been successfully generated and used for re-encryption.

**4.  Pseudocode (Client-Side - Key Rotation):**

```
function rotateKey() {
  // 1. Initiate Biometric Authentication
  biometricAuthResult = performBiometricAuthentication();

  if (biometricAuthResult == SUCCESS) {
    // 2. Generate New Encryption Key
    newEncryptionKey = generateRandomEncryptionKey();

    // 3. Generate Server Challenge (Optional)
    serverChallenge = requestServerChallenge();

    // 4. Derive Key-Encrypting Key
    keyEncryptingKey = deriveKeyEncryptingKey(serverChallenge, sharedSecret); // sharedSecret derived from SSO

    // 5. Encrypt New Key
    encryptedNewKey = encrypt(newEncryptionKey, keyEncryptingKey);

    // 6. Re-Encrypt All Data
    reEncryptAllData(encryptedNewKey);

    // 7. Securely Wipe Old Key
    wipeOldEncryptionKey();

    // 8. Send Key Attestation (Optional)
    sendKeyAttestationToServer();
  } else {
    // Authentication Failed - prevent access.
    log("Authentication failed. Access denied.");
  }
}

function reEncryptAllData(encryptedNewKey){
  //Iterate through all encrypted files/data blocks
  for each encryptedData in allEncryptedData{
    decryptedData = decrypt(encryptedData, currentEncryptionKey);
    encryptedData = encrypt(decryptedData, encryptedNewKey);
    save(encryptedData);
  }
}
```

**5.  Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Biometric sensor (fingerprint, camera, microphone).
*   Secure enclave or trusted execution environment (TEE) for storing biometric templates and cryptographic keys.
*   Strong encryption algorithms (AES, ChaCha20).
*   Cryptographically secure random number generator (CSRNG).

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security against compromised keys.
*   Increased resilience against physical attacks.
*   Improved data protection in case of device loss or theft.
*   Greater user control over data security.
