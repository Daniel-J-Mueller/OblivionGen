## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted Activity ‘Shadows’

**Concept:** Extend the aggregate activity level monitoring to *predict* future load based on historical data, creating a ‘shadow’ of expected activity that influences resource allocation *before* it impacts performance. This isn’t reactive – it’s proactively anticipating need.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Preprocessing Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw activity metrics (as per patent - service requests, packet counts, CPU load, etc.) from all monitored components.
*   **Process:**
    *   Time-series data ingestion with nanosecond precision timestamps.
    *   Data cleaning: outlier removal using a rolling median filter.
    *   Feature engineering: Create derived metrics such as rate of change, moving averages (short-term and long-term), and seasonal decomposition (hourly, daily, weekly).
*   **Output:**  Cleaned, feature-engineered time-series data.

**2. Predictive Modeling Module:**

*   **Model:** Employ a hybrid model combining:
    *   **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks:** For capturing long-range dependencies in time-series data. Multiple LSTM layers are used.
    *   **Prophet (Facebook’s time-series forecasting procedure):** For modeling seasonality and trend components.
    *   **Ensemble Method:** Combine LSTM and Prophet predictions using a weighted average (weights optimized via cross-validation).
*   **Training:** Continuous retraining of the model with new data (every hour or as needed) using a sliding window approach.
*   **Prediction Horizon:** Predict activity levels for the next 5-30 minutes.
*   **Output:** Predicted aggregate activity level with confidence intervals.  Separate predictions for different components (web servers, network devices, etc.).

**3. Resource Allocation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Predicted aggregate activity level (with confidence intervals), baseline activity level, current resource allocation, resource pool availability.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Shadow Resource Provisioning:** Allocate ‘shadow’ resources *proactively* based on predicted activity. These resources are *not* immediately activated but are pre-provisioned (VMs spun up but idle, network bandwidth reserved). The quantity of shadow resources is determined by the predicted activity level and the confidence interval.  Higher confidence/higher predicted activity = more shadow resources.
    *   **Dynamic Scaling Thresholds:** Adjust scaling thresholds for existing resources based on predicted activity.  Lower the threshold if a spike is predicted, raising it otherwise.
    *   **Resource Prioritization:**  Prioritize allocation of shadow resources to critical components based on predefined business rules.
*   **Output:**  Commands to the infrastructure management system (Kubernetes, cloud provider APIs) to provision/deprovision resources, adjust scaling thresholds, and prioritize allocation.

**4. Feedback & Learning Module:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor actual resource utilization after shadow resource provisioning.
    *   Compare predicted activity with actual activity.
    *   Calculate a ‘prediction accuracy’ score.
    *   Adjust model weights and parameters to improve prediction accuracy (using reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization).
*   **Output:** Updated model parameters and prediction accuracy scores.



**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Engine):**

```
function allocateResources(predictedActivity, baselineActivity, currentAllocation, resourcePool) {
  confidenceInterval = getConfidenceInterval(predictedActivity);
  shadowResourceCount = calculateShadowResourceCount(predictedActivity, baselineActivity, confidenceInterval);
  priorityList = getPriorityList();  //List of components ordered by importance
  
  for (component in priorityList) {
    if (resourcePool.hasAvailableResource(component)) {
      resourcePool.provisionResource(component);
      currentAllocation[component] += 1;
    }
  }
  
  //Adjust scaling thresholds for existing resources
  for (component in currentAllocation) {
    scalingThreshold = calculateScalingThreshold(predictedActivity, baselineActivity);
    component.setScalingThreshold(scalingThreshold);
  }
}
```
