**Automated Container Reconfiguration System**

**Concept:** Expand upon the foldable container design by integrating an internal robotic system capable of autonomously reconfiguring the containerâ€™s shape *during* transport, optimizing for space and stability.

**Specifications:**

*   **Container Base:** Maintain the existing foldable/stackable base structure with wheels as described in the patent.  Add reinforced mounting points internally for robotic components.
*   **Internal Robotic Arm:** Single 6-axis robotic arm housed within the container.  Arm materials: lightweight carbon fiber alloy.  End effector:  multi-function gripper capable of manipulating internal dividers/supports.  Power source: high-density, quick-swap battery pack integrated into the container base.
*   **Internal Support Structure:**  Modular, lightweight dividers/supports constructed from interconnected triangular prisms (similar to expandable tent poles). These connect to the container walls and to each other, forming variable internal compartments. Each prism segment will have magnetic connection points for securing to the robotic arm end effector.  Material: high-strength polymer composite.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in the container base to detect orientation, acceleration, and vibration.
    *   Load sensors in the container base to determine weight distribution.
    *   Proximity sensors on the robotic arm to prevent collisions with container walls or contents.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Embedded microcontroller with wireless communication (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi).
    *   Pre-programmed reconfiguration profiles based on cargo type and transport conditions (e.g., fragile, heavy, unbalanced).
    *   Remote monitoring and control via mobile app/web interface.
*   **Operation:**
    1.  Cargo is loaded into the container.
    2.  User selects cargo type/parameters via the app.
    3.  Control system calculates optimal internal configuration.
    4.  Robotic arm manipulates the modular dividers, forming compartments and securing the cargo.
    5.  During transport, the IMU and load sensors monitor stability. The robotic arm dynamically adjusts the internal configuration to compensate for shifts in weight or changes in terrain.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Reconfiguration Logic):**

```
FUNCTION adjustConfiguration(imuData, loadData)
  // Define stability thresholds
  stabilityThreshold = 5 degrees
  loadImbalanceThreshold = 10%

  // Check for instability
  IF (imuData.angle > stabilityThreshold) THEN
    // Shift weight towards stable side
    MOVE modularDividerTo(direction = oppositeOf(tiltDirection))

  // Check for load imbalance
  IF (loadData.leftSideWeight < loadData.rightSideWeight - loadImbalanceThreshold) THEN
    // Shift weight from right to left
    MOVE modularDividerTo(direction = left)

  // Check for impacts and dampen vibrations
  IF (imuData.acceleration > impactThreshold) THEN
    // Tighten modular dividers to brace impact
    LOCK modularDividers

  END IF

END FUNCTION

```

**Future Considerations:**

*   Integration with autonomous vehicle control systems.
*   AI-powered cargo recognition and automatic configuration.
*   Self-repair capabilities for the robotic arm.
*   Active suspension system for the container base.
