## Dynamic Task Swapping & Collaborative Pathing

**Concept:** Expand the user path development beyond *items* to encompass *tasks*. Introduce a system where users can accept/reject dynamically offered tasks *while* navigating the facility, and paths are collaboratively optimized based on task acceptance across multiple users.

**Specifications:**

**1. Task Database & Prioritization:**

*   **Data Structure:** A database storing tasks with attributes:
    *   `taskID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `taskType`: Categorization (e.g., ‘cycle count’, ‘quality check’, ‘restock’, ‘deliver to staging’).
    *   `location`: Inventory location(s) associated with the task.
    *   `estimatedDuration`: Predicted completion time.
    *   `priority`: Numerical value indicating urgency.
    *   `skillRequirement`: Necessary user skills/certifications.
    *   `rewardPoints`: Points awarded to user upon completion.
*   **Priority Engine:** A system that dynamically adjusts task priority based on:
    *   Real-time inventory levels.
    *   Urgency of downstream processes.
    *   User skillsets and availability.
    *   Facility congestion.

**2. Dynamic Task Offer & Acceptance:**

*   **Proximity Trigger:** When a user enters a defined proximity of a task location, the system assesses task suitability based on user profile (skills, certifications, current workload) and displays the task offer on their mobile device/wearable.
*   **Task Preview:** The offer details estimated duration, reward points, and a brief description of the task.
*   **Accept/Reject Logic:**
    *   **Accept:** The user’s path is immediately re-routed to incorporate the task location *before* continuing to their original planned items.
    *   **Reject:** The task is re-queued for another user.
*   **Time Limit:** A timer on task offers to encourage quick decision-making.

**3. Collaborative Path Optimization:**

*   **Multi-User Awareness:** The system maintains real-time location data for all active users.
*   **Path Conflict Resolution:** If multiple users are heading towards the same location:
    *   The system dynamically adjusts paths to minimize congestion.
    *   Tasks can be re-assigned to balance workload.
*   **Synergistic Task Grouping:** If two users are completing related tasks in close proximity, the system can suggest collaborative completion to improve efficiency.
*   **'Swarm' Routing:** For urgent tasks, the system can broadcast the task to multiple nearby users and assign it to the first acceptor.

**4. System Integration & Pseudocode**

```pseudocode
// Core Function: Update User Path
FUNCTION UpdateUserPath(userID, acceptedTaskID):
  userPath = GetCurrentPath(userID)
  IF acceptedTaskID != NULL:
    taskLocation = GetTaskLocation(acceptedTaskID)
    InsertTaskLocationIntoPath(userPath, taskLocation)
    recalculatePath(userPath) // Optimization algorithm (e.g., A*)
  ENDIF
  TransmitUpdatedPathToUser(userID, userPath)

// Collision Avoidance Function
FUNCTION AvoidCollision(userID, otherUserID):
  userPath = GetCurrentPath(userID)
  otherPath = GetCurrentPath(otherUserID)
  IF pathsIntersect(userPath, otherPath):
    // Calculate detour for one or both users
    detour = calculateDetour(userPath, otherPath)
    applyDetour(userPath, detour)
    transmitUpdatedPathToUser(userID, userPath)
    transmitUpdatedPathToUser(otherUserID, otherPath)
  ENDIF
```

**5. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Enhanced imaging system capable of accurate user tracking and item identification.
*   Real-time location system (RTLS) – UWB, Bluetooth beacons, or similar.
*   Mobile devices or wearables for users.
*   Central server infrastructure for data processing and path optimization.
