## Dynamic Trust Scoring & Adaptive Authentication

**Concept:** Expand the authentication beyond simple permission checks to incorporate a dynamic trust score for both the client *and* the user, influencing the authentication method *and* the granularity of access granted. This builds on the existing remote directory lookup but adds a layer of behavioral analysis and risk assessment.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Collection & Scoring Engine:**

1.  **Client Device Fingerprinting:**  Collect data points including:
    *   Hardware specs (CPU, RAM, GPU)
    *   Operating System & Version
    *   Browser details (User Agent)
    *   Installed plugins/extensions
    *   Network Information (IP address, geolocation, ISP)
    *   Timezone
2.  **User Behavioral Analysis:** Track:
    *   Login times & locations (historical data)
    *   Access patterns (applications accessed, data consumed, actions performed)
    *   Transaction amounts & frequencies
    *   Keystroke dynamics (typing speed, rhythm - optional, requires client-side agent)
3.  **Threat Intelligence Integration:**  Real-time feeds of:
    *   Known malicious IP addresses
    *   Compromised credentials databases
    *   Phishing domain lists
4.  **Scoring Algorithm:** Combine data points using a weighted scoring algorithm.  Weights assigned based on historical data and threat intelligence.  Output a Trust Score (0-100) for both the client and the user.  Separate scoring models for client & user.

**II. Adaptive Authentication Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Request:** Client attempts to access service.
2.  **Trust Score Lookup:** System retrieves current Trust Scores for client and user.
3.  **Authentication Level Selection:** Based on combined Trust Scores:
    *   **High Trust (80-100):**  No further authentication required.  Grant full access.
    *   **Medium Trust (50-79):**  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with a low-friction method (e.g., push notification to registered device). Limited access scope initially.
    *   **Low Trust (0-49):**  Strong MFA (e.g., OTP via SMS/Email, biometric authentication). Highly restricted access scope.  Potential for manual review by security personnel.
4.  **Behavioral Biometrics (Optional):**  During session, continuously monitor user behavior (mouse movements, scrolling patterns, typing speed).  Detect anomalies that deviate from established baseline.  Trigger re-authentication or session termination if anomalies detected.
5.  **Dynamic Authorization:**  Beyond simple permission checks, dynamically adjust access scope based on Trust Score and behavioral data.  Example: User with low Trust Score attempting to access sensitive data may be denied access or required to provide additional justification.

**III. System Components:**

1.  **Trust Scoring Engine:** Dedicated service responsible for collecting data, applying the scoring algorithm, and maintaining Trust Scores. Scalable architecture (e.g., microservices).
2.  **Authentication Proxy:** Intercepts authentication requests, retrieves Trust Scores, and enforces authentication policies.
3.  **Behavioral Monitoring Agent (Optional):** Client-side agent responsible for collecting behavioral data and transmitting it to the Behavioral Monitoring Service.
4.  **Data Storage:** Secure and scalable storage for Trust Scores, behavioral data, and audit logs.

**Pseudocode (Authentication Proxy):**

```
function authenticate(request):
  client_id = request.client_id
  user_id = request.user_id

  client_trust_score = TrustScoringEngine.get_score(client_id)
  user_trust_score = TrustScoringEngine.get_score(user_id)

  combined_trust_score = (client_trust_score + user_trust_score) / 2

  if combined_trust_score >= 80:
    grant_access(request.user_id, request.resource)
    return success
  else if combined_trust_score >= 50:
    send_mfa_challenge(request.user_id)
    if mfa_successful:
      grant_access(request.user_id, request.resource, limited_scope)
      return success
    else:
      return failure
  else:
    send_strong_mfa_challenge(request.user_id)
    if strong_mfa_successful:
      grant_access(request.user_id, request.resource, highly_restricted_scope)
      return success
    else:
      log_suspicious_activity()
      return failure
```
