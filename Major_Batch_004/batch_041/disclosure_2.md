## Multi-Modal Domain Prioritization & Contextual Blending

**Concept:** Extend the multi-domain NLU system to ingest and prioritize domain selection based on *concurrent* multi-modal input – not just text (ASR output), but also visual and potentially sensor data.  Furthermore, actively blend contextual information *across* domains, recognizing that a single user utterance may simultaneously relate to multiple, seemingly disparate areas.

**Specs:**

**1. Multi-Modal Input Module:**

*   **Inputs:**
    *   Audio Data (for ASR – as in the base patent).
    *   Visual Data:  Live video feed or static images from a device camera.
    *   Sensor Data: Accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, proximity sensors (depending on the device).
*   **Processing:**
    *   ASR module operates as before, generating text data.
    *   Computer Vision Module:  Object detection, scene understanding, facial expression analysis.  Outputs:  Tagged objects, scene description, emotional state estimation.
    *   Sensor Fusion: Integrates sensor data (e.g., location, motion) to provide contextual awareness.
*   **Output:** A unified data stream containing: text, object tags, scene description, sensor readings, and associated confidence scores.

**2. Domain Prioritization Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Unified data stream from the Multi-Modal Input Module.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Weighted Feature Extraction:** Extract features from each data stream (text, vision, sensors). Assign weights to each feature based on learned importance (using a training dataset).
    *   **Domain Scoring:** Each NLU component (associated with a domain) is assigned a score based on the weighted features.  For example:
        *   Text:  Keywords related to the domain.
        *   Vision:  Object detection (e.g., detecting a “coffee cup” increases the score for the “food ordering” domain). Scene understanding (e.g., “office environment” increases the score for “scheduling” or “email”).
        *   Sensors: Location data (e.g., “restaurant” increases the score for “food ordering”). Motion data (e.g., “driving” increases the score for “navigation”).
    *   **Bayesian Inference:** Use Bayesian inference to combine scores from all data streams and estimate the probability that the utterance belongs to each domain.  This allows the system to handle noisy or ambiguous input.
*   **Output:**  A ranked list of domains, with associated probabilities.

**3. Contextual Blending Module:**

*   **Input:** Ranked list of domains, original utterance text, and feature vectors from the Multi-Modal Input Module.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Cross-Domain Entity Resolution:** Identify entities that are relevant to multiple domains.  For example, a user saying "Remind me to pick up milk" might involve both the “grocery list” domain and the “scheduling” domain.
    *   **Intent Graph Construction:**  Build a graph representing the relationships between intents across different domains.  This allows the system to reason about complex user requests that span multiple areas.  For example, an intent in the "music" domain might be linked to an intent in the "navigation" domain if the user is requesting music for a car ride.
    *   **Unified Response Generation:** Generate a response that addresses all relevant domains and intents.  This might involve combining information from multiple NLU components and presenting it in a coherent manner.
*   **Output:** A unified response, addressing all relevant domains and intents.

**Pseudocode (Domain Prioritization Engine):**

```python
def prioritize_domains(text_features, vision_features, sensor_features, domain_components):
  domain_scores = {}
  for domain in domain_components:
    domain_scores[domain] = 0

    # Weighted scoring for each feature type
    domain_scores[domain] += text_weight * score_text(text_features, domain)
    domain_scores[domain] += vision_weight * score_vision(vision_features, domain)
    domain_scores[domain] += sensor_weight * score_sensors(sensor_features, domain)

  # Bayesian Inference (simplified)
  domain_probabilities = {}
  total_score = sum(domain_scores.values())
  for domain, score in domain_scores.items():
    domain_probabilities[domain] = score / total_score

  # Sort by probability
  sorted_domains = sorted(domain_probabilities.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)
  return sorted_domains
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Smart Home Control:**  Recognizing complex requests that involve multiple devices and domains (e.g., "Turn on the lights, play some music, and set the temperature to 72").
*   **Automotive Assistants:**  Responding to nuanced requests that require awareness of the driving environment (e.g., "Find a coffee shop nearby and navigate me there, but avoid toll roads").
*   **Personalized Assistants:**  Providing proactive assistance based on the user's context and preferences.
