## Adaptive Rights Drift Detection & Proactive Mitigation

**Concept:** Extend the peer-based anomaly detection to actively *predict* rights drift based on temporal trends in peer groups and proactively adjust permissions *before* an anomaly is fully realized.  This moves from reactive alerting to preventative security/access control.

**Specifications:**

**1. Temporal Peer Grouping:**

*   **Data Input:** Beyond static rights vectors, collect a time-series of rights vectors for each individual.  Frequency: Daily, or as granular as feasible.
*   **Algorithm:** Implement a sliding window approach to define "temporal peer groups."  For a given individual at time *t*, identify peers who have had similar rights profiles over the *n* days preceding *t*. *n* is a configurable parameter.  Use Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) as in the base patent, but operate on the time-series data, not just the current rights vector.  This produces a dynamic peer group which changes over time.
*   **Output:** For each individual at time *t*, a ranked list of temporal peers, and a similarity score reflecting the strength of the temporal relationship.

**2. Drift Prediction:**

*   **Trend Analysis:** For each right *r*, calculate the rate of change of its prevalence within each temporal peer group over time.  Simple linear regression or more sophisticated time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) can be used.
*   **Anomaly Thresholds:** Establish configurable thresholds for the rate of change of each right.  If the predicted rate of change exceeds the threshold, flag the right as potentially drifting.
*   **Prediction Horizon:**  Predict the future prevalence of the right within the peer group over a configurable horizon (e.g., 7 days).

**3. Proactive Mitigation:**

*   **Risk Scoring:**  Assign a risk score to each potentially drifting right based on its predicted prevalence, the magnitude of the drift, and the sensitivity of the right (defined by a configurable sensitivity matrix).
*   **Automated Adjustment:**  Based on the risk score, automatically adjust the individual's permissions.  Options:
    *   **Temporary Restriction:** Temporarily remove or restrict access to the right.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Prompt:** Trigger an MFA prompt before granting access.
    *   **Alert & Review:** Alert a security administrator for manual review.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Track the effectiveness of the automated adjustments. If an adjustment proves to be incorrect (e.g., a false positive), adjust the thresholds and sensitivity matrix accordingly.

**Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// For each individual 'i' at time 't'
temporal_peers = FindTemporalPeers(i, t, n) // Find peers with similar rights over 'n' days

// For each right 'r'
predicted_prevalence = ForecastRightPrevalence(temporal_peers, r, t)
drift_score = CalculateDriftScore(predicted_prevalence)

if drift_score > threshold:
  risk_score = CalculateRiskScore(drift_score, sensitivity_matrix[r])
  if risk_score > mitigation_threshold:
    MitigateRight(i, r, risk_score) // e.g., remove access, prompt MFA
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `RightsVector`:  (As in the base patent).
*   `TemporalRightsVector`: List of `RightsVector` indexed by timestamp.
*   `SensitivityMatrix`:  Map from right to sensitivity score (higher = more sensitive).
*   `ConfigurableThresholds`: Values for `n`, drift thresholds, mitigation thresholds.

**System Components:**

*   **Data Ingestion:**  Collect rights vectors and timestamps.
*   **Temporal Peer Grouping Engine:** Implements `FindTemporalPeers`.
*   **Drift Prediction Engine:** Implements `ForecastRightPrevalence` and `CalculateDriftScore`.
*   **Mitigation Engine:** Implements `MitigateRight`.
*   **Configuration Management:**  Manages `ConfigurableThresholds` and `SensitivityMatrix`.
