## Adaptive Event Schema Generation & Injection

**Concept:** Extend the internal event generation beyond simple delivery status (success/failure) to dynamically infer and create event schemas based on event *content* and inject these into downstream workflows. This allows workflows to adapt to data variations *without* pre-defined schemas or explicit configuration changes.

**Specifications:**

**1. Content Analysis Module:**

   *   **Input:** Incoming event payload (any format - JSON, XML, binary).
   *   **Process:**
        *   Employ a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., autoencoder, clustering algorithm) to identify dominant data types and structures *within* the payload.  The model will be trained on a broad range of possible event payloads, focusing on identifying frequently occurring patterns.
        *   Output a dynamically generated "event schema" represented as a JSON object. This schema will include:
            *   Field names (automatically derived).
            *   Data types (inferred - string, integer, boolean, date, etc.).
            *   Optional: Validation rules (e.g., regular expressions, range constraints).
            *   Confidence score for each fieldâ€™s data type inference.
   *   **Output:** Dynamically generated event schema (JSON), confidence scores.

**2. Schema Injection & Event Augmentation Module:**

   *   **Input:** Original incoming event payload, dynamically generated event schema, internal event rule definitions.
   *   **Process:**
        *   Augment the original event with the dynamically generated schema.  This could be done by adding a dedicated "schema" field to the event payload.
        *   Based on the injected schema, dynamically generate internal events.  Internal event rules will be defined in terms of the *schema fields*, not specific values.  For example:
            *   "If event schema contains field 'user_id' of type integer, generate internal event 'user_profile_request'."
            *   "If event schema contains field 'amount' of type float AND amount > 1000, generate internal event 'high_value_transaction'."
   *   **Output:** Augmented event payload, dynamically generated internal events.

**3. Adaptive Rule Engine:**

   *   **Input:** Internal event rules (defined using schema field names and data types), dynamically generated internal events.
   *   **Process:**
        *   Rule engine evaluates rules against dynamically generated internal events.
        *   Triggers actions based on matching rules.
   *   **Output:** Actions to be performed (e.g., send event to another target, generate a message).

**Pseudocode (Schema Injection):**

```
function injectSchema(event, schema) {
  event.schema = schema;
  return event;
}

function generateInternalEvents(event, rules) {
  internalEvents = [];
  for (rule in rules) {
    if (event.schema.hasField(rule.field) && event.schema.fieldType(rule.field) == rule.type) {
      internalEvents.push(rule.eventName);
    }
  }
  return internalEvents;
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Event Schema (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "fields": [
        {"name": "user_id", "type": "integer", "confidence": 0.95},
        {"name": "amount", "type": "float", "confidence": 0.8},
        {"name": "timestamp", "type": "string", "confidence": 0.7}
      ]
    }
    ```
*   **Internal Event Rule (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "field": "user_id",
      "type": "integer",
      "eventName": "user_profile_request"
    }
    ```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Flexibility:** Workflows can adapt to changing data formats without code changes.
*   **Reduced Configuration:** Eliminate the need to define schemas upfront.
*   **Improved Scalability:** Handle a wider range of event types.
*   **Enhanced Automation:** Automate schema discovery and workflow adaptation.
