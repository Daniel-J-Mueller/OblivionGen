## Dynamic Event Prioritization & Sharding

**Concept:** Expand the multi-region event processing system to incorporate dynamic event prioritization *and* event sharding based on real-time system load and event characteristics. This moves beyond simple redundancy to active, intelligent event distribution for optimal processing speed and resource utilization.

**Specs:**

**1. Event Metadata Enrichment:**

*   **New Metadata Fields:** Add fields to each event payload:
    *   `Priority`: Integer value (1-10, 1 being highest) – Initial priority assigned by event source.
    *   `Complexity`: Integer value (1-5, 1 being simplest) – Estimate of processing resource demand.
    *   `ShardKey`: Hashable identifier derived from event content (e.g., user ID, device ID).
*   **Metadata Injection Service:** Create a service that intercepts incoming events, assigns default values for `Priority` and `Complexity` if not provided, and calculates `ShardKey`.

**2. Regional Load Monitoring & Prediction:**

*   **Load Agents:** Deploy agents to each region to continuously monitor:
    *   CPU Utilization
    *   Memory Usage
    *   Event Queue Length
    *   Processing Latency
*   **Prediction Model:** Implement a time-series prediction model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to forecast regional load based on historical data and current trends.

**3. Intelligent Event Routing:**

*   **Central Router Service:**  A service responsible for routing events to the optimal region. It utilizes:
    *   Load data from regional Load Agents.
    *   Load predictions.
    *   Event `Priority` and `Complexity`.
    *   Event `ShardKey` (for consistent sharding).
*   **Routing Algorithm:**
    *   **Priority-Based:** Higher priority events are routed to regions with the lowest latency.
    *   **Complexity-Aware:** Complex events are routed to regions with ample resources.
    *   **Shard-Consistent:** Events with the same `ShardKey` are consistently routed to the same region (ensuring order and state consistency).
*   **Dynamic Weighting:** Adjust the weighting of priority, complexity, and shard consistency based on overall system health and performance goals.

**4.  Event Sharding Implementation:**

*   **Hash Ring:** Utilize a consistent hashing algorithm (e.g., Jump Consistent Hash) to map `ShardKey` values to specific regions.
*   **Virtual Nodes:** Implement virtual nodes to improve load balancing and resilience in the hash ring.
*   **Shard Migration:** Implement a mechanism to dynamically migrate shards between regions if load imbalances occur.

**5.  Replication Record Enhancement:**

*   **Shard ID:** Add a `ShardID` field to the replication record.
*   **Regional Completion Status:** Expand replication record to store completion status for each region individually.
*   **Shard Migration History:** Track shard migrations in the replication record to prevent unnecessary replication.

**Pseudocode (Central Router Service):**

```
function routeEvent(event):
  priority = event.priority
  complexity = event.complexity
  shardKey = event.shardKey

  regionalLoad = getRegionalLoad() //Returns dictionary of {region: load}
  predictedLoad = predictRegionalLoad() //Returns dictionary of {region: load}

  //Calculate scores for each region
  scores = {}
  for region in regions:
    score = (priority * (1 - regionalLoad[region])) + (complexity * (1 - predictedLoad[region]))
    scores[region] = score

  //Determine best region
  bestRegion = max(scores, key=scores.get)

  //Hash shardKey to determine region (consistent sharding)
  consistentRegion = hash(shardKey) % len(regions)

  //Combine scores with consistent sharding (weighted)
  finalRegion = (0.7 * bestRegion) + (0.3 * consistentRegion)

  //Send event to selected region
  sendEvent(event, finalRegion)
```
