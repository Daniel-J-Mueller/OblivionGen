**Micro-Lens Array for Dynamic Focal Plane Electrowetting Displays**

**Concept:** Integrate a micro-lens array *above* the electrowetting display surface to create a dynamically adjustable focal plane. This allows for 3D-like visual effects without requiring complex head-tracking or multi-layered displays. The electrowetting cells themselves would modulate light transmission, and the micro-lens array would focus or diverge this light, simulating depth.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Micro-Lens Array:**
    *   Material: Transparent polymer (e.g., PDMS, PMMA) with high refractive index.
    *   Lens Shape: Aspheric lenses to minimize aberrations.
    *   Lens Diameter: 50-100 μm.
    *   Pitch: 100-200 μm (distance between lens centers).
    *   Array Configuration: Hexagonal close-pack for optimal space utilization and uniform coverage.
    *   Actuation: Each lens is individually controlled via micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) actuators. These actuators can change the lens height (Z-axis) altering focal length. Alternatively, utilize electro-wetting of the lens-array interface with a conducting fluid.

2.  **Electrowetting Display Integration:**
    *   Cell Size: Pixel pitch matches or is a multiple of the micro-lens pitch to avoid moiré patterns.
    *   Driving Scheme: Standard electrowetting display driving scheme to control light transmission through each pixel.
    *   Interface Layer: A transparent conductive layer between the electrowetting cells and the micro-lens array to provide electrical connections for the MEMS actuators.

3.  **Control System:**
    *   Algorithm: A depth mapping algorithm to determine the desired focal plane for each region of the display. This can be based on image content, user input, or pre-defined depth profiles.
    *   Mapping: Map the depth map to individual lens heights. Greater depth = greater lens height change.
    *   Processing: Real-time processing of depth information and control signals for the MEMS actuators. A dedicated FPGA or ASIC is preferred for low latency.
    *   Input: Depth data sourced from multiple cameras, LiDAR, structured light, or other depth-sensing technologies.

4.  **Materials:**
    *   Substrate: Glass or flexible polymer substrate for the electrowetting display.
    *   Electrodes: Indium tin oxide (ITO) or other transparent conductive material.
    *   Fluids: Two immiscible fluids with different refractive indices for electrowetting modulation.
    *   Encapsulation: Transparent encapsulation layer to protect the display from environmental factors.

**Pseudocode (Control System):**

```
// Input: Depth Map (2D array of depth values)
// Output: Control Signals for each MEMS Actuator

FOR each pixel (x, y) in Depth Map:
    depth = DepthMap[x, y]
    
    // Map depth value to actuator height
    actuatorHeight = MapDepthToHeight(depth)
    
    // Generate control signal for the actuator
    controlSignal = GenerateActuatorSignal(actuatorHeight)
    
    // Send control signal to actuator
    SendSignalToActuator(x, y, controlSignal)
END FOR
```

*   **Viewing Angle:** Optimize lens design and arrangement to maximize viewing angle and minimize distortion.
*   **Power Management:** Implement power management techniques to minimize energy consumption.
*   **Calibration:** Implement a calibration procedure to compensate for manufacturing variations and ensure accurate depth mapping.
