## Dynamic Trust Anchors & Ephemeral Domains

**Concept:** Leveraging the core idea of a web of trust, this system introduces *dynamic trust anchors* and *ephemeral domains* to create highly secure and adaptable distributed systems, particularly suited for environments with rapidly changing security needs or short-lived deployments (e.g., disaster response, temporary research networks).

**Specification:**

**1. Trust Anchor Dynamics:**

*   **Traditional Anchors:** Existing systems typically rely on static, pre-defined root of trust. This design introduces a rotating pool of ‘Trust Validators’ (TVs). These TVs are not permanently designated; their roles are assigned via a distributed consensus mechanism (e.g., Proof-of-Stake, Raft) and rotate on a configurable schedule.
*   **TV Attestation:** Each TV must provide continuous attestation of its secure state, using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or equivalent, signed by a preceding TV in the rotation. This creates a verifiable chain of trust.
*   **Dynamic Root Calculation:** A 'Root of Trust Aggregate' (RTA) is calculated periodically. The RTA isn’t a single key, but a hash of the currently active TVs' public keys, weighted by their 'Trust Score' (see 2). The RTA becomes the active root for validating new domain trust versions.
*   **Trust Score:** Each TV accumulates a ‘Trust Score’ based on uptime, successful attestation, participation in consensus, and adherence to security protocols. Low scores can trigger temporary or permanent removal from the TV pool.

**2. Ephemeral Domains:**

*   **Domain Lifecycle:** Domains are created *on-demand* with a pre-defined Time-To-Live (TTL). This is crucial for temporary deployments where long-term security infrastructure isn’t warranted.
*   **Initial Domain Trust (IDT):** Each new domain begins with a minimal IDT. This IDT defines the initial set of allowed operations, the required quorum for creating new versions, and a set of permissible security modules.
*   **Versioned Trust Policy (VTP):** Instead of directly modifying the IDT, all changes are applied as VTPs. A VTP is a digitally signed delta containing modifications to the existing trust policy. Multiple VTPs can be chained together to build up a complex trust configuration.
*   **VTP Validation:** Each VTP must be validated against the current domain trust using the active RTA. Validation checks ensure the VTP doesn't violate any pre-defined security constraints.
*   **Automated Policy Enforcement:** Once validated, the VTP is automatically applied to the domain’s security modules, updating access control lists and other relevant configurations.

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   **Data Structure: DomainTrustVersion**
    *   `versionID: UUID`
    *   `timestamp: Timestamp`
    *   `operators: [OperatorID]`
    *   `quorumRules: [QuorumRule]`
    *   `securityModules: [SecurityModuleID]`
    *   `digitalSignature: Signature`
    *   `precedingVersionID: UUID` (Links to previous version)
*   **Pseudocode (VTP Application):**

```pseudocode
function applyVTP(domainTrustVersion, vtp, rta):
  // 1. Verify vtp signature using rta
  if not verifySignature(vtp, rta):
    return ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE

  // 2. Apply changes to domainTrustVersion
  newDomainTrustVersion = deepCopy(domainTrustVersion)
  applyDelta(newDomainTrustVersion, vtp.changes)

  // 3. Re-sign the new version
  newSignature = sign(newDomainTrustVersion, privateKeyAssociatedWithSecurityModule)

  // 4. Update domain trust with new version and signature
  updateDomainTrust(domainTrustVersion, newDomainTrustVersion, newSignature)

  return SUCCESS
```

*   **Security Modules:** Plug-in architecture allowing for flexible integration of different security technologies (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption modules).  Modules receive policy updates via the VTP mechanism.

**Novelty:** This combines the flexibility of versioned trust policies with dynamic trust anchors. By rotating the root of trust and limiting the lifespan of domains, it significantly reduces the attack surface and enhances resilience against compromised systems.  The architecture allows for rapid adaptation to changing security threats and simplifies the management of complex distributed systems.
