## Dynamic Policy Orchestration via Predictive Resource Modeling

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting authorization policies *before* a request is fully processed, based on predicted resource consumption and system load. This moves beyond reactive authorization (after a request is made) to proactive policy adjustments.

**Core Concept:** Leverage machine learning models to predict resource usage (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, database connections) *given* a partial request description.  Then, dynamically adjust authorization policies—not just allowing or denying—but *modifying* resource limits and priorities—to optimize system performance and prevent bottlenecks *before* they occur.

**Components:**

1.  **Request Interceptor:**  Captures incoming operation requests *before* full processing. Extracts key metadata (user ID, operation type, input data characteristics - size, format, complexity).

2.  **Resource Prediction Model:** A trained machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or a transformer network) that predicts resource consumption based on the extracted request metadata. The model is continuously retrained using real-time resource usage data.  This model provides a probability distribution of resource needs.

3.  **Policy Orchestrator:**  Receives the resource predictions from the Resource Prediction Model.  Based on these predictions, the Policy Orchestrator dynamically adjusts authorization policies *before* the request proceeds to the core operation.  Adjustments include:
    *   **Resource Quotas:**  Temporarily modifying resource limits (CPU time, memory allocation) for the requesting user or operation.
    *   **Priority Weighting:**  Adjusting the priority of the request in a resource queue (e.g., giving a low-priority request less CPU time).
    *   **Operation Throttling:**  Temporarily limiting the rate at which similar operations can be executed.
    *   **Conditional Policy Application:** Applying different policies based on predicted resource risk (e.g., increased auditing for high-risk requests).

4.  **Dynamic Policy Store:** A central repository for storing and managing the dynamic authorization policies.  The store supports versioning and rollback in case of policy misconfiguration.

5.  **Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitors actual resource usage during operation execution.  This data is used to refine the Resource Prediction Model and improve the accuracy of policy adjustments.

**Pseudocode (Policy Orchestrator):**

```
function orchestratePolicy(request):
  metadata = extractMetadata(request)
  resourcePrediction = predictResourceUsage(metadata)  // Calls Resource Prediction Model

  if resourcePrediction.predictedRisk > threshold:
    policyAdjustment = calculatePolicyAdjustment(resourcePrediction)
    applyPolicyAdjustment(request, policyAdjustment)
  else:
    // Use default policy
    pass

  return request
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `RequestMetadata`: {userID, operationType, inputDataSize, inputDataFormat, complexityScore}
*   `ResourcePrediction`: {CPU_predicted, Memory_predicted, Network_predicted,  predictedRisk (score based on predicted resource usage and current system load)}
*   `PolicyAdjustment`: {CPU_limit, Memory_limit, Priority_weight, Throttling_rate}

**Novelty:** This system is proactive rather than reactive.  Current authorization systems generally authorize or deny access after a request is made, but this system anticipates resource needs and dynamically adjusts policies *before* the request is processed. This allows for more efficient resource utilization and prevents bottlenecks before they occur.
