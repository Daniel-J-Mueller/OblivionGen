## Dynamic Gift Bundling & Experiential Integration

**Concept:** Expand beyond product selection to integrate experiential gifts and dynamically bundle them with physical products based on recipient profiles and evolving preferences.

**Specifications:**

**1. Recipient Profile Deep Dive:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate with social media APIs (with user consent), purchase history (if available), stated preferences via a dedicated app/web interface, and inferred interests based on browsing behavior.
*   **Preference Vectors:** Create multi-dimensional preference vectors representing recipient interests (e.g., “outdoor adventure” = 0.8, “culinary arts” = 0.6, “relaxation” = 0.9).
*   **Dynamic Weighting:**  Employ machine learning to dynamically adjust vector weights over time based on recipient interactions and feedback.

**2. Experiential Gift Catalog:**

*   **API Integration:**  Partner with experience providers (e.g., cooking classes, concert tickets, spa treatments, escape rooms, local tours) to provide real-time availability and pricing via API.
*   **Categorization:** Categorize experiences based on interest areas, price range, location, and duration.
*   **Virtual Previews:** Incorporate 360° virtual tours and video previews of experiences.

**3. Dynamic Bundling Engine:**

*   **Algorithm:** A recommendation engine leveraging the recipient’s preference vector and the experience catalog. It calculates a “compatibility score” between products and experiences.
*   **Bundling Rules:**  Define rules for bundling (e.g., “If recipient’s ‘culinary arts’ score > 0.7, prioritize bundling with a cooking class”).
*   **Price Optimization:** Optimize bundle pricing based on individual item prices, bundle discounts, and perceived value.
*   **AI-Driven Bundle Curation:** An AI agent proactively generates and suggests bundle options based on real-time recipient behavior (e.g., if recipient views hiking boots online, suggest a hiking experience bundle).

**4. Gift Completion & Scheduling:**

*   **Integrated Calendar:**  Allow gift giver to select a delivery date for the physical product and schedule the experience at a convenient time for the recipient.
*   **Automated Reminders:** Send automated reminders to both gift giver and recipient regarding delivery and experience scheduling.
*   **Digital Gift Card Integration:**  Allow recipient to choose a different experience or product if their initial selection is unavailable.
*    **Post-Experience Feedback:** Gather feedback from recipient after completing the experience to refine preference vectors and improve bundle recommendations.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generate_bundle(recipient_profile, product_catalog, experience_catalog):
    compatibility_scores = {}

    for product in product_catalog:
        for experience in experience_catalog:
            score = calculate_compatibility(product, experience, recipient_profile)
            compatibility_scores[(product, experience)] = score

    sorted_bundles = sort_by_compatibility(compatibility_scores)

    best_bundle = sorted_bundles[0]

    bundle_price = calculate_bundle_price(best_bundle)

    return best_bundle, bundle_price

function calculate_compatibility(product, experience, recipient_profile):
    product_score = calculate_product_relevance(product, recipient_profile)
    experience_score = calculate_experience_relevance(experience, recipient_profile)
    combined_score = (product_score + experience_score) / 2
    return combined_score
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Cloud-based server infrastructure.
*   API integrations with various experience providers.
*   Machine learning algorithms for preference vector creation and bundle recommendation.
*   Mobile app and web interface for gift givers and recipients.
*   Secure payment processing.
