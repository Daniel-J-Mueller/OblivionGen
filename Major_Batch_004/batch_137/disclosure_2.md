## Dynamic Panoramic Layering with Predictive Occlusion

**Concept:** Expand the buffered field of view concept by layering panoramic video segments based on predicted user gaze *and* probabilistic occlusion modeling. This creates a progressive detail delivery system where only the areas *most likely* to be viewed, and *not* obscured by real-world objects, receive high-resolution streaming.

**Specs:**

1.  **Gaze Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Client device motion data (accelerometer, gyroscope), past gaze data (if available), panoramic video context (scene understanding via object recognition).
    *   Process: Employ a Kalman filter or recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict the user’s likely gaze direction within the panoramic video over the next 1-2 seconds. Output: A probability distribution over potential gaze points within the panoramic space.

2.  **Probabilistic Occlusion Model:**
    *   Input: Real-time depth data from client device camera (depth sensor, stereo cameras, or monocular depth estimation), environmental map (if available), object recognition data within the panoramic video.
    *   Process: Create a probabilistic occlusion map based on the likelihood of real-world objects (e.g., user’s hands, furniture, other people) obscuring portions of the panoramic video.  High probability = likely occlusion.

3.  **Dynamic Layering Engine:**
    *   Input: Gaze prediction probability distribution, probabilistic occlusion map, panoramic video data.
    *   Process:
        *   Divide panoramic video into layers based on distance from predicted gaze point. (e.g., Layer 0: within 10 degrees, Layer 1: 10-30 degrees, Layer 2: 30-60 degrees).
        *   Prioritize high-resolution streaming for Layer 0, modulating resolution for subsequent layers based on occlusion probability. Areas with high occlusion probability receive lowest resolution.
        *   Employ a foveated rendering technique; high detail where the gaze is predicted, low detail elsewhere.
        *   Dynamically adjust layer boundaries and resolutions based on real-time gaze tracking and occlusion analysis.

4.  **Buffering & Streaming Protocol:**
    *   Maintain a buffer of pre-rendered panoramic segments at varying resolutions.
    *   Stream prioritized layers based on prediction accuracy and network bandwidth.
    *   Utilize a delta-encoding scheme to minimize bandwidth usage. Only transmit changes between frames.
    *   Implement adaptive bitrate streaming to maintain a smooth viewing experience.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Layer Generation):**

```
function generate_layers(gaze_prediction, occlusion_map, panoramic_video):
  layers = []
  layer_resolution = [ "high", "medium", "low", "very_low" ]
  layer_index = 0

  for distance in range(max_distance):
    layer_segments = select_segments_within_distance(distance, panoramic_video)
    layer_resolution_index = calculate_resolution_index(layer_segments, occlusion_map, gaze_prediction)
    layer_resolution_level = layer_resolution[layer_resolution_index]
    render_layer(layer_segments, layer_resolution_level)
    layers.append(rendered_layer)
    layer_index += 1

  return layers
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Client device with depth sensor (or stereo cameras).
*   High-bandwidth network connection.
*   Powerful client-side processor for rendering and decoding.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality experiences.
*   Remote tourism/live event streaming.
*   Security/surveillance systems.
*   Interactive storytelling.
