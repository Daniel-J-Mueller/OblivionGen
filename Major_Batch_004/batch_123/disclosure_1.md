## Dynamic Model Stitching for Federated Edge Devices

**Concept:** Extend the compressed/complete model switching paradigm to a *federated* edge computing environment where individual devices contribute to a globally refined model *while* simultaneously optimizing local performance through dynamic model stitching. 

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A “Model Stitching Manager” (MSM) residing on each edge device.
*   **Model Repository:**  Each device maintains a local repository containing:
    *   A base "skeleton" model (minimal layers, highly compressed).
    *   A library of modular “skill” models (e.g., object detection, sentiment analysis, noise reduction) – each compressed.
    *   A "policy engine" that determines which skill models to stitch onto the skeleton model.
*   **Federated Learning Integration:** The device periodically contributes skill model performance metrics and stitching policy updates to a central server. The server aggregates these contributions to refine a global policy model and optimize skill models. The refined skill models and policy are then distributed back to the edge devices.
*   **Dynamic Stitching:** MSM monitors real-time data characteristics (e.g., data complexity, processing load, energy constraints). It dynamically stitches/unstitches skill models to the skeleton model to optimize performance *without* requiring a full model reload.

**Pseudocode (MSM – simplified):**

```
function process_data(input_data):
  // 1. Data Analysis
  data_complexity = analyze_data(input_data)
  processing_load = get_current_load()
  energy_level = get_energy_level()

  // 2. Policy Evaluation (based on data characteristics and device state)
  required_skills = evaluate_policy(data_complexity, processing_load, energy_level)

  // 3. Model Stitching/Unstitching
  for skill in required_skills:
    if skill not in currently_stitched_skills:
      stitch_skill(skill)
    end if
  end for
  for skill in currently_stitched_skills:
    if skill not in required_skills:
      unstitch_skill(skill)
    end if
  end for

  // 4. Data Processing with Stitched Model
  processed_data = process_data_with_current_model(input_data)
  return processed_data
end function

function stitch_skill(skill):
  // Load compressed skill model
  load_compressed_model(skill)
  // Integrate skill model into current model graph
  integrate_model(skill)
end function

function unstitch_skill(skill):
  // Remove skill model from current model graph
  remove_model(skill)
  // Release memory associated with skill model
  release_memory(skill)
end function
```

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond simple compressed/complete model switching. It establishes a *flexible* and *adaptive* model architecture at the edge. Instead of relying on a single large model, it dynamically assembles a model tailored to the specific data and device constraints. The federated learning component ensures that the collective intelligence of all edge devices is leveraged to refine both the individual skill models and the overall stitching policy. This allows for continuous optimization and adaptation to changing environments and data patterns.
