## Personalized Micro-Cohort Advertisement Delivery

**Concept:** Leverage the existing demographic and behavioral data to create dynamically shifting "micro-cohorts" for ad delivery. Instead of targeting broad demographic groups, ads are delivered to very small groups of users exhibiting *current*, highly specific behavioral patterns, predicted to respond positively to the ad. This moves beyond static demographic targeting towards a real-time, behavioral-driven system.

**Specs:**

1.  **Behavioral Signal Ingestion:**
    *   Data Sources: OTT viewing history, survey data (day-part, content preference), user account data (age, gender, location), device type, connection speed, ad interaction (clicks, views, skips), co-viewership data.
    *   Real-time Data Pipeline:  Ingest data streams with <1 second latency.
    *   Feature Engineering: Generate features representing user activity in the last hour, 6 hours, 24 hours.  Examples:  "Number of true crime documentaries watched," "Frequency of fast food ad clicks," "Time spent watching sports during primetime," "Device used for streaming (TV, phone, tablet)."

2.  **Micro-Cohort Formation (Dynamic Clustering):**
    *   Algorithm:  Implement a hybrid clustering algorithm combining k-means (for initial segmentation based on broad features) and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) for identifying dense clusters of users with similar recent behaviors.
    *   Cohort Size: Dynamic, ranging from 5-50 users.  Adjust cohort size based on data density and cluster stability.
    *   Cohort Lifetime: Short-lived, lasting only 30-60 minutes. Cohorts dissolve and reform as user behaviors change.
    *   Cohort Feature Vector: Each cohort is represented by a feature vector summarizing the collective behaviors of its members. This includes aggregate statistics (average view time, most frequent content category) and behavioral trends (e.g., “increasing interest in home improvement”).

3.  **Ad Assignment & Bidding:**
    *   Ad-Cohort Matching: Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., a neural network) to predict the probability that a cohort will positively respond to a given ad. The model takes as input the ad’s features (category, creative, length) and the cohort’s feature vector.
    *   Dynamic Bidding: Adjust bid prices in real-time based on the predicted response probability and the number of users in the cohort. Higher probability and larger cohort size = higher bid.
    *   A/B Testing: Continuously A/B test different ads within each cohort to optimize performance.
    *   Prioritization: Assign a 'freshness' score to cohorts. Newer cohorts get bidding priority over older ones.

4.  **System Architecture:**

    ```pseudocode
    class AdDeliverySystem:
        def __init__(self):
            self.data_pipeline = DataPipeline()
            self.clustering_engine = ClusteringEngine()
            self.bidding_engine = BiddingEngine()

        def process_impression_data(self, impression_data):
            user_features = self.data_pipeline.extract_features(impression_data)
            cohort = self.clustering_engine.assign_to_cohort(user_features)
            bid_price = self.bidding_engine.calculate_bid(cohort, impression_data)
            return bid_price

    class DataPipeline:
        def extract_features(self, impression_data):
            # Extract features from impression data, user history, etc.
            # Returns a feature vector
            pass

    class ClusteringEngine:
        def assign_to_cohort(self, feature_vector):
            # Assign user to a cohort based on their feature vector
            # Uses k-means and DBSCAN
            pass

    class BiddingEngine:
        def calculate_bid(self, cohort, impression_data):
            # Calculate bid price based on cohort characteristics and ad data
            # Uses a machine learning model
            pass
    ```

5.  **Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitor ad performance within each cohort. Use this data to refine the clustering algorithm, the bid pricing model, and the ad assignment process. Reinforcement learning techniques can be used to optimize bidding strategy over time.
