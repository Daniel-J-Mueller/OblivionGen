## Dynamic Logic Problem Difficulty Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend the system to dynamically adjust the difficulty of generated logic problems *during* solver execution, based on real-time solver performance. This aims to create a more adaptive and efficient testing environment for constraint solvers, allowing for a broader range of difficulty levels within a single test suite.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** DifficultyAdjuster
*   **Inputs:**
    *   `current_problem`: The current logic problem instance being solved.
    *   `solver_performance_metrics`: Real-time data from the constraint solver (e.g., CPU time, number of backtracks, depth of search tree).
    *   `difficulty_range`: A defined range of acceptable difficulty levels (e.g., 1-10).
    *   `target_difficulty`: A desired average difficulty level for the test suite.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   `modified_problem`:  A potentially altered version of the `current_problem`.
    *   `difficulty_score`: An estimated difficulty score for the `modified_problem`.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION adjust_difficulty(current_problem, solver_performance_metrics, difficulty_range, target_difficulty):

  // 1. Calculate Current Difficulty
  current_difficulty = estimate_difficulty(solver_performance_metrics) // Function to map performance metrics to difficulty

  // 2. Determine Adjustment Needed
  difficulty_difference = target_difficulty - current_difficulty
  adjustment_factor = difficulty_difference * adjustment_sensitivity // adjustment_sensitivity is a tunable parameter

  // 3.  Problem Modification (Based on adjustment_factor)

  IF adjustment_factor > 0:  // Increase Difficulty
    modified_problem = add_constraints(current_problem, adjustment_factor) //Add new constraints
  ELSE IF adjustment_factor < 0: // Decrease Difficulty
    modified_problem = remove_constraints(current_problem, ABS(adjustment_factor)) //Remove constraints
  ELSE:
    modified_problem = current_problem

  // 4.  Recalculate Difficulty
  difficulty_score = estimate_difficulty(solver_performance_metrics_of_modified_problem)

  RETURN modified_problem, difficulty_score

//Helper functions:
FUNCTION estimate_difficulty(solver_performance_metrics):
    // Map metrics (CPU time, backtracks, search depth) to a difficulty score.
    // Use a weighted sum or a more complex machine learning model.
    // Return a value within the defined difficulty range.

FUNCTION add_constraints(problem, factor):
    // Introduce new constraints to the problem. 
    // Constraints could be randomly generated or intelligently selected to increase complexity.
    // Consider adding redundant constraints or constraints that subtly alter the solution space.

FUNCTION remove_constraints(problem, factor):
    // Remove existing constraints from the problem. 
    // Select constraints that are not critical to the problemâ€™s solvability.
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The `estimate_difficulty` function is crucial. It requires careful tuning and potentially the use of machine learning to accurately map solver performance to difficulty.
*   Adding and removing constraints requires a mechanism to ensure that the problem remains logically consistent and solvable.
*   A feedback loop can be implemented to dynamically adjust the `adjustment_sensitivity` parameter based on the overall performance of the test suite. This will allow the system to adapt to different solvers and problem types.
*   Problem generation & modification could be enhanced by utilizing AI to learn which constraints have the most impact on difficulty.
