## Adaptive Resource Allocation Based on Predicted Service Call Chains

**Concept:** Extend the weighted resource throttling to incorporate predictive modeling of service call chains. Instead of just weighting individual calls based on resource consumption, predict *future* calls likely to be triggered by the current call and pre-allocate resources accordingly. This moves beyond reactive throttling to proactive resource management.

**Specifications:**

**1. Service Call Graph Construction:**

*   **Data Collection:** Continuously monitor and log service call sequences. Each log entry includes:
    *   Calling Service
    *   Called Service
    *   Resource Consumption (CPU, Memory, Network, Disk I/O)
    *   Timestamp
*   **Graph Creation:** Construct a directed graph where:
    *   Nodes represent services.
    *   Edges represent the probability of one service calling another.  Probability is calculated from the collected data (e.g., frequency of Service A calling Service B / Total calls originating from Service A).
*   **Dynamic Updates:**  The graph is not static. It is continuously updated as new service call data is received.  A decay factor can be applied to older data to give more weight to recent behavior.

**2. Predictive Resource Allocation Engine:**

*   **Initial Call Reception:** When a service call arrives at the load balancer:
    *   Identify the calling service.
    *   Query the Service Call Graph to determine the most likely next *n* services to be called. ( *n* is a configurable parameter).
    *   Estimate the combined resource requirements for the initial call *and* the predicted subsequent calls. This can be a weighted average of resource consumption data.
*   **Resource Reservation:**  Reserve the estimated resources on the appropriate host computing devices. This doesn't necessarily mean fully allocating *all* the resources upfront. It could involve signaling the hosts to prioritize certain requests.
*   **Monitoring & Adjustment:**  Continuously monitor the actual resource consumption of the initial call.
    *   If consumption deviates significantly from the prediction, adjust the reserved resources accordingly.
    *   If predicted subsequent calls are not triggered, release the reserved resources.

**3. Weighting Integration:**

*   **Combined Weighting:**  The existing weighted throttling system is *integrated* with the predictive resource allocation.  The weights are now applied to the combined resource requirements of the initial call *and* the predicted subsequent calls.
*   **Confidence Factor:**  A “confidence factor” is calculated based on the accuracy of the Service Call Graph predictions. This factor modifies the weighting, giving more weight to predictions with higher confidence.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// On Service Call Reception
function handleServiceCall(call) {
  callingService = call.getCallingService();
  predictedServices = getPredictedServices(callingService);
  estimatedResourceNeeds = calculateEstimatedResourceNeeds(call, predictedServices);
  combinedWeight = calculateCombinedWeight(estimatedResourceNeeds);

  reserveResources(combinedWeight);
  processCall(call);
}

function getPredictedServices(callingService) {
  // Query Service Call Graph for top 'n' predicted services
  return graph.getNeighbors(callingService);
}

function calculateEstimatedResourceNeeds(call, predictedServices) {
  totalNeeds = call.getResourceNeeds();
  for (service in predictedServices) {
    totalNeeds += service.getDefaultResourceNeeds(); // Or historical average
  }
  return totalNeeds;
}
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   A dedicated data store is required for the Service Call Graph. A graph database would be ideal.
*   The predictive modeling component could be implemented using machine learning techniques (e.g., recurrent neural networks).
*   The resource reservation mechanism should be lightweight and efficient to avoid introducing significant overhead.
*   Monitoring and alerting are crucial for detecting and responding to unexpected resource consumption patterns.
