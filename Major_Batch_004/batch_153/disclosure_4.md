## Dynamic Swarm Mapping & Predictive Collision Avoidance

**Concept:** Expand the existing UAV management system to incorporate real-time swarm mapping coupled with predictive collision avoidance based on intent recognition. The current system focuses on trajectory computation *after* UAVs are within a defined airspace. This system shifts focus to proactively understanding and shaping the airspace *before* arrival, leveraging collective intelligence from the swarm itself.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite Integration:** Each UAV equipped with:
    *   High-resolution LiDAR (minimum 200m range)
    *   Stereo vision cameras
    *   UWB (Ultra-Wideband) radio for precise relative positioning (sub-30cm accuracy) between UAVs.
    *   V2X communication module for broadcast of intent/trajectory.
*   **Swarm Mapping Module (Ground Station & UAV):**
    *   **Real-time Volumetric Mapping:** UAVs continuously scan their surroundings, constructing a 3D volumetric map of the controlled airspace. Data is fused from multiple UAVs.
    *   **Dynamic Obstacle Identification:** Identify both static (buildings, structures) and *dynamic* obstacles (other UAVs, birds, temporary structures).
    *   **Predictive Mapping:**  Utilize historical data & machine learning to *predict* potential future obstacles (e.g., delivery truck movements near the facility perimeter).
*   **Intent Recognition Module (Ground Station):**
    *   **Trajectory Analysis:** Analyze UAV trajectories to infer intent (e.g., approaching landing pad, returning to storage).
    *   **Communication Decoding:**  Decode V2X communication from UAVs to explicitly understand their planned actions.  Standardized intent messaging protocol. (e.g., `INTENT: DELIVER, DESTINATION: PAD_ALPHA, PRIORITY: HIGH`)
    *   **Behavioral Modeling:**  Create behavioral models for different UAV types (e.g., delivery drones, inspection drones) to improve intent prediction accuracy.
*   **Predictive Collision Avoidance Engine (Ground Station):**
    *   **Trajectory Prediction:**  Predict future trajectories of all UAVs within the airspace based on current state, intent, and learned behaviors.
    *   **Collision Risk Assessment:**  Calculate collision risk probabilities between all UAV pairs.
    *   **Proactive Path Adjustment:**  *Before* collisions become imminent, generate optimized path adjustments for UAVs to minimize risk.  Prioritize adjustments based on mission criticality and safety.
    *   **Negotiation Protocol:**  Implement a decentralized negotiation protocol between UAVs to resolve potential conflicts. (e.g., UAV A requests a slight altitude adjustment from UAV B to avoid a predicted intersection.)
*   **Quarantine Zones:**
    *   Dynamically generated temporary exclusion areas based on observed swarm behavior, risk assessment, or unexpected events. 
    *   Quarantine zones are broadcast to all UAVs, triggering automated route deviations.
*   **Ground Station Software:**
    *   Visualisation interface for the 3D volumetric map, predicted trajectories, and collision risk assessments.
    *   Remote override capabilities for manual intervention.
* **Pseudocode â€“ Path Adjustment:**

```
function adjustPath(UAV_A, UAV_B, predicted_intersection):
  risk_level = calculateRisk(predicted_intersection)

  if risk_level > threshold:
    // Attempt negotiation
    negotiation_success = negotiatePath(UAV_A, UAV_B)

    if negotiation_success:
      // Apply adjusted trajectories
      UAV_A.updateTrajectory(new_trajectory_A)
      UAV_B.updateTrajectory(new_trajectory_B)
    else:
      // Implement emergency maneuver
      UAV_A.executeEmergencyManeuver(avoidance_strategy)
  return
```
