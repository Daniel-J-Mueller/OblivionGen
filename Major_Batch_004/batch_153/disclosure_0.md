## Adaptive Function Chaining for Serverless Applications

**Specification:** A system to dynamically assemble serverless functions into execution chains based on real-time data characteristics and performance metrics, enabling optimization beyond static workflows.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of a fixed sequence of serverless functions for a task, build a graph of available functions. A ‘chain orchestrator’ analyzes incoming data *before* execution and constructs an optimal function chain on-the-fly. This is distinct from state machines, which still follow pre-defined transitions.  This focuses on *data-driven* assembly.

**Components:**

1.  **Function Registry:** A central repository detailing all available serverless functions, including:
    *   Function ID
    *   Input Data Types (schema)
    *   Output Data Types (schema)
    *   Performance Metrics (average execution time, cost, resource usage)
    *   Data Characteristics (the *type* of data it excels at processing – e.g., ‘image processing’, ‘text summarization’, ‘numerical analysis’)
    *   Dependencies (other functions it requires)

2.  **Data Analyzer:** This component examines incoming data *before* execution.
    *   Data Type Identification:  Determines the exact data type (e.g., JPEG, PNG, text, CSV).
    *   Data Characteristic Extraction:  Analyzes data content to identify relevant characteristics. For images: dominant colors, object detection. For text: sentiment, keywords, language. For numerical data: statistical distribution, range.
    *   Creates a 'Data Profile' – a structured representation of the data’s characteristics.

3.  **Chain Orchestrator:** The core logic.
    *   Receives the Data Profile.
    *   Queries the Function Registry for functions matching the Data Profile.  (e.g., "find functions that can process JPEG images and perform object detection").
    *   Utilizes a cost/benefit optimization algorithm (e.g., A*, genetic algorithm) to build the optimal function chain. Considerations:
        *   Execution time
        *   Cost
        *   Resource usage
        *   Data transformation requirements (functions might need to ‘translate’ data for downstream functions).
    *   Generates a 'Chain Definition' – a sequence of Function IDs and data transformation instructions.

4.  **Execution Engine:**  Manages the execution of the function chain.
    *   Receives the Chain Definition.
    *   Invokes functions in the defined sequence.
    *   Handles data transfer between functions.
    *   Monitors performance and logs data.

**Pseudocode (Chain Orchestrator):**

```
function buildChain(dataProfile):
  candidateFunctions = FunctionRegistry.query(dataProfile)
  
  if candidateFunctions is empty:
    return error("No matching functions found")

  // Optimization Algorithm (Simplified A*)
  openSet = [ ([], 0) ]  // (chain, cost)
  closedSet = []

  while openSet is not empty:
    currentChain, currentCost = openSet.pop(0)

    lastFunction = currentChain[-1] if currentChain else None
    
    if isGoal(currentChain, dataProfile):
      return currentChain

    closedSet.append((currentChain, currentCost))

    for function in candidateFunctions:
      if function not in currentChain:
        //Check data compatibility between last function and current function

        newChain = currentChain + [function]
        newCost = currentCost + function.cost

        if not isChainInClosedSet(newChain, closedSet):
            openSet.append((newChain, newCost))

    //Sort open set by cost
    openSet.sort(key = lambda x: x[1])

  return error("No chain found")
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond static workflows by dynamically assembling function chains *at runtime*, adapting to the characteristics of each individual data input.  The data analysis component is crucial; it's not simply about chaining functions, but about choosing the *right* functions based on *what the data is*. This goes beyond simple routing. This moves closer to the concept of an adaptive ‘computational graph’ built on-demand.
