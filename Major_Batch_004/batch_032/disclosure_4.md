## Dynamic Product Narrative Generation

**Concept:** Leverage cluster analysis and purchase history to automatically generate compelling, personalized product narratives for marketing and e-commerce platforms.  Currently, the patent focuses on *assigning* products to categories. This expands that by *describing* those products based on the clustered user affinities.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Narrative Template Library:** A database of pre-written narrative templates, categorized by product type and broad affinity themes (e.g., "eco-conscious," "performance-driven," "budget-friendly," "luxury"). These templates contain placeholders for specific product attributes and user profile information.
2.  **Attribute Extraction Module:**  This module extracts key attributes from product data (specifications, images, keywords) and third-party data feeds (certifications, reviews). It utilizes image recognition, natural language processing, and data normalization techniques.
3.  **Cluster-Affinity Mapping:** The system maps user clusters (as identified in the provided patent) to specific affinity themes. This mapping is dynamically updated based on purchase patterns and user interactions.  A confidence score will represent the mapping strength.
4.  **Narrative Assembly Engine:**  This engine selects the most appropriate narrative template based on the product category, cluster-affinity mapping, extracted attributes, and associated confidence score. It then populates the template with the relevant data, generating a unique product narrative.  The engine will employ a weighted scoring system to prioritize attributes based on their relevance to the affinity theme.
5.  **A/B Testing & Optimization:**  The system continuously A/B tests different narrative variations to optimize for click-through rates, conversion rates, and other key performance indicators.  Machine learning algorithms are used to identify the most effective narrative elements.
6.  **User Interface:**  A dashboard for marketers to view narrative performance, customize templates, and adjust affinity mappings.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION GenerateProductNarrative(ProductID, UserClusterID)

  // 1. Retrieve Product Data
  ProductData = GetProductData(ProductID)

  // 2. Determine User Affinity Theme
  AffinityTheme = GetAffinityTheme(UserClusterID)

  // 3. Select Narrative Template
  Template = SelectTemplate(ProductData.Category, AffinityTheme)

  // 4. Extract Relevant Attributes
  Attributes = ExtractAttributes(ProductData, AffinityTheme)

  // 5. Populate Template
  Narrative = PopulateTemplate(Template, Attributes)

  // 6. Return Narrative
  RETURN Narrative
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION PopulateTemplate(Template, Attributes)
  //Iterate through each placeholder in template
  FOR EACH Placeholder IN Template.Placeholders
     //IF Attribute exists for placeholder
     IF Attribute IN Attributes
        //Replace placeholder with attribute value
        Template = ReplacePlaceholder(Template, Placeholder, Attribute.Value)
     ELSE
        //Use default value for placeholder
        Template = ReplacePlaceholder(Template, Placeholder, Placeholder.DefaultValue)
     ENDIF
  ENDFOR
  RETURN Template
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Product`: `{ProductID, Category, Attributes, ...}`
*   `UserCluster`: `{ClusterID, AffinityTheme, ConfidenceScore, ...}`
*   `NarrativeTemplate`: `{TemplateID, Category, AffinityTheme, Placeholders, ...}`
*   `Placeholder`: `{Name, DefaultValue, DataType, ...}`

**Potential Applications:**

*   Personalized product descriptions on e-commerce websites.
*   Targeted marketing copy for email campaigns and social media ads.
*   Dynamic content generation for product landing pages.
*   Automated creation of product stories and brand narratives.
