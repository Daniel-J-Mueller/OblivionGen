## Dynamic Computational Graph Augmentation with Simulated Agents

**Concept:** Extend the computational graph generation to *actively* simulate diverse agent behaviors and environmental conditions *during* graph construction, rather than solely relying on observed API call data or static analysis. This allows for proactive identification of edge cases and vulnerabilities *before* runtime, leading to more robust and comprehensive testing.

**Specifications:**

**1. Agent Simulation Engine:**

*   **Input:** API specification (OpenAPI/Swagger), configurable parameters for agent behavior (e.g., request rate, error tolerance, data variability), and environmental profiles (e.g., network latency, resource contention).
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Generates synthetic API requests based on the API specification and agent profiles. These profiles dictate how the 'agents' interact with the API.
    *   Emulates various agent types:
        *   **Normal Users:** Represent typical API usage patterns.
        *   **Stress Testers:** Generate high volumes of requests to identify performance bottlenecks.
        *   **Malicious Actors:** Simulate attacks (e.g., injection attacks, denial-of-service) by crafting malicious requests.
        *   **Faulty Clients:** Introduce errors and invalid data to assess error handling.
    *   Simulates network conditions (latency, packet loss) and resource contention (CPU, memory) to replicate real-world environments.
*   **Output:** A stream of synthetic API requests with associated metadata (agent type, environment parameters).

**2. Augmented Graph Generation:**

*   **Input:** Synthetic API request stream from the Agent Simulation Engine, existing computational graph (initially built from observed API calls or static analysis).
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Integrates synthetic API requests into the computational graph *during* its construction. Each request becomes a new path in the graph.
    *   Labels nodes and edges with metadata derived from the Agent Simulation Engine (agent type, environment parameters). This provides context for understanding the simulated scenarios.
    *   Dynamically adjusts graph complexity based on the number of simulated scenarios and the desired level of coverage.
    *   Implements a 'coverage metric' to track the extent to which different agent behaviors and environmental conditions have been explored.

**3. Test Case Generation & Validation:**

*   **Input:** Augmented computational graph, desired test coverage criteria.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Generates test cases by traversing the augmented graph, prioritizing paths that represent critical scenarios or uncovered areas.
    *   Validates test cases against the API specification and desired coverage criteria.
    *   Automatically adapts test cases based on feedback from the API (e.g., errors, performance metrics).

**Pseudocode (Augmented Graph Generation):**

```
function generateAugmentedGraph(apiSpec, agentProfiles, envProfiles):
  graph = generateInitialGraph(apiSpec)  // From observed data/static analysis

  for agentProfile in agentProfiles:
    for envProfile in envProfiles:
      requestStream = generateRequestStream(agentProfile, envProfile)

      for request in requestStream:
        node = addNodeToGraph(request)
        edge = addEdgeToGraph(previousNode, node, request)
        labelNode(node, "agentType", agentProfile.type)
        labelNode(node, "environment", envProfile.name)
        updateCoverageMetrics(node)

  return graph
```

**Innovation:** This differs from the source patent by proactively injecting simulated agent behavior into the graph construction process, rather than solely relying on observed data. This allows for earlier detection of edge cases and vulnerabilities, leading to more robust testing. The system can anticipate issues before they manifest in production. The dynamic nature of graph augmentation improves the overall testing process.
