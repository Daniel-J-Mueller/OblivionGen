## Dynamic Service Image 'Chaining' & Predictive Scaling

**Concept:** Extend the system to allow for service images to *depend* on each other, forming dynamic chains. Introduce predictive scaling based on chained image behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Service Image Dependency Definition:**

*   **Data Structure:** Introduce a ‘Dependency Manifest’ associated with each service image. This manifest defines:
    *   `required_images`: List of service image IDs that *must* be running for this image to function correctly.
    *   `data_transfer_protocols`:  Defines how data is passed between images (e.g., gRPC, message queue, shared volume).
    *   `dependency_health_check`:  A function/endpoint within the image that confirms its readiness to receive data from dependencies.
*   **Manifest Storage:**  Store Dependency Manifests within the Electronic Catalog alongside the service image metadata.
*   **Image Registration:**  Mandatory registration of dependency information upon service image submission.

**2. Automated Dependency Resolution & Orchestration:**

*   **Deployment Trigger:** When a customer requests a service image, the system *first* resolves its dependencies from the Electronic Catalog.
*   **Orchestration Engine:** A new component responsible for:
    *   Creating virtual computing device instances for *all* dependent images *before* the primary image.
    *   Configuring network connectivity based on `data_transfer_protocols`.
    *   Executing health checks on dependencies before initiating the primary image.
    *   Maintaining the lifecycle of dependent images alongside the primary image.
*   **Failure Handling:** If a dependency fails to launch or health check, the entire deployment fails, triggering an alert to the provider/operator.

**3. Predictive Scaling Based on Chained Image Behavior:**

*   **Behavioral Monitoring:** Track key metrics *across* the entire chain of service images (e.g., request latency, error rates, resource usage).
*   **Correlation Engine:**  Identify correlations between metrics in different images. For example, increased latency in image A might consistently precede increased resource usage in image B.
*   **Predictive Model:** Train a machine learning model to predict resource needs in downstream images based on upstream image behavior.
*   **Proactive Scaling:**  Automatically scale downstream images *before* they become overloaded, based on predictions from the model.
*   **Scaling Parameters:** The predictive model should consider not just resource usage, but also cost, and the potential for ‘cold start’ delays associated with launching new instances.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Scaling Logic):**

```
function predict_downstream_scale(upstream_metrics, downstream_image_id):
  // Fetch historical data on upstream/downstream correlation
  historical_data = get_correlation_data(downstream_image_id)

  // Train or load a predictive model based on historical data
  model = load_model(downstream_image_id)
  if model is null:
    model = train_model(historical_data)

  // Predict resource needs based on current upstream metrics
  predicted_resource_needs = model.predict(upstream_metrics)

  // Determine scaling factor based on predicted needs and current capacity
  scaling_factor = calculate_scaling_factor(predicted_resource_needs, current_capacity)

  return scaling_factor

function auto_scale(downstream_image_id, scaling_factor):
  // Adjust the number of instances for the downstream image
  num_instances = current_num_instances + scaling_factor
  adjust_instance_count(downstream_image_id, num_instances)
```

**Example Use Case:**

A video processing pipeline. Image A performs object detection. Image B renders the video with overlays. Image C transcodes the video. The system could predict that increased object density (from Image A) will require more rendering resources (Image B) and proactively scale Image B instances.
