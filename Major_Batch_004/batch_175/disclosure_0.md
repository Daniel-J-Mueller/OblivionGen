## Adaptive Passcode Generation via Biometric Drift

**Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust passcode complexity & generation algorithms based on long-term biometric drift detected from device usage patterns.

**Specification:**

**1. Biometric Drift Monitoring:**

*   **Data Collection:** Continuously monitor user interaction metrics:
    *   Typing speed/rhythm (keystroke dynamics)
    *   Touchscreen pressure & area of contact
    *   Device holding angle (accelerometer data)
    *   Gait analysis (if device is mobile – accelerometer/gyroscope)
*   **Baseline Establishment:**  After initial setup, establish a ‘golden section’ baseline for each metric over a defined period (e.g. 7 days). This baseline represents the user's typical interaction profile.
*   **Drift Detection:** Implement a statistical drift detection algorithm (e.g., Cumulative Sum Control Chart – CUSUM, or Exponentially Weighted Moving Average – EWMA) to identify significant deviations from the baseline.  Thresholds for ‘drift’ will be configurable.
*   **Drift Categorization:** Classify drift into categories:
    *   **Minor Drift:**  Slight variations likely due to temporary factors (e.g., fatigue, stress).
    *   **Moderate Drift:**  Suggests developing changes in user behavior (e.g., early stages of a medical condition).
    *   **Major Drift:**  Indicates a substantial change – potential account compromise, or significant user impairment.

**2. Adaptive Passcode Algorithm Selection:**

*   **Algorithm Library:** Maintain a library of passcode generation algorithms, varying in complexity & security:
    *   **Simple Pattern Lock:** Basic visual pattern.
    *   **PIN/Password with Complexity Rules:** Standard alphanumeric passcode.
    *   **Biometric Passcode:**  Passcode is linked to biometric characteristics (e.g., a specific signature style with a stylus)
    *   **Contextual Passcode:** Passcode combines biometric input with environmental factors (e.g. location, time)
    *   **Challenge-Response Passcode:**  Device presents a unique visual/auditory challenge, and user responds with a corresponding input.
*   **Dynamic Selection:** Algorithm selection is governed by the ‘drift category’ detected:
    *   **No Drift/Minor Drift:** Maintain current passcode algorithm.
    *   **Moderate Drift:** Increase passcode complexity (e.g., increase PIN length, add special characters).
    *   **Major Drift:** Initiate a full passcode reset *and* transition to the most secure algorithm (e.g., biometric passcode with multi-factor authentication).  Consider temporarily disabling access until user verification via a separate channel.

**3. Passcode Generation Process:**

*   **Algorithm Initialization:**  Based on selected algorithm and drift category:
    *   Generate a random ‘seed’ value.
    *   Incorporate biometric data (typing rhythm, touch pressure) into the seed generation process (adds user-specific entropy).
*   **Passcode Construction:** Use the seed and algorithm to generate a passcode.
*   **Passcode Delivery:**  Deliver the passcode (or instructions for generating it) to the user.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Device-Side Module:**  Responsible for:
    *   Data collection (biometric metrics).
    *   Drift detection.
    *   Passcode generation/verification.
*   **Remote Server:**
    *   Algorithm library.
    *   Configuration management.
    *   Remote passcode reset (in case of severe drift).

**Pseudocode (Device-Side):**

```
function generatePasscode():
    driftCategory = detectDrift()
    algorithm = selectAlgorithm(driftCategory)
    seed = generateSeed(algorithm)
    passcode = generatePasscodeFromSeed(seed, algorithm)
    return passcode

function detectDrift():
    // Analyze biometric data, compare to baseline
    // Return "Minor", "Moderate", or "Major"

function selectAlgorithm(driftCategory):
    if driftCategory == "Minor":
        return currentAlgorithm
    else if driftCategory == "Moderate":
        return moreComplexAlgorithm
    else:
        return mostSecureAlgorithm

function generateSeed(algorithm):
    // Incorporate biometric data into seed generation
    // (e.g., typing rhythm, touch pressure)
    return randomSeed + biometricEntropy

```

**Potential Advantages:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Adapts to changing user behavior, making it harder for attackers to compromise accounts.
*   **Improved User Experience:**  Minimizes disruption by only increasing security when necessary.
*   **Accessibility:**  Can accommodate users with varying degrees of physical impairment.
*   **Proactive Security:** Can detect potential security threats before they occur.
