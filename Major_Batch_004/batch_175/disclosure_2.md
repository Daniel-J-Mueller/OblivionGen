## Temporal Journaling with Selective Disclosure

**Concept:** Extend the journal's capability beyond simple proof of existence to enable controlled, time-limited access to data based on retained hash values. This is targeted toward scenarios requiring audit trails with dynamic data governance – imagine supply chain verification where access to specific data points is granted *only* during a predefined window.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure Augmentation:** Each leaf node in the journal now includes a 'Disclosure Policy' field alongside the hash value and entry reference. The Disclosure Policy is a set of conditions governing access to the associated data. These conditions will comprise:
    *   `StartTime`: A timestamp indicating when access is permitted.
    *   `EndTime`: A timestamp indicating when access is revoked.
    *   `AccessKey`: A cryptographic key or identifier required to decrypt/access the entry. This key can change over time.
*   **Hash Value Modification:** The hash value calculation *must* incorporate the `Disclosure Policy` parameters (StartTime, EndTime, AccessKey) along with the entry data.  A change in any of these parameters results in a different hash value. This ensures immutability of the access rules alongside the data itself. The hash function must be collision-resistant.
*   **Access Control Layer:** Implement an 'Access Validator' component that sits between data requesters and the journal.  This component performs the following:
    1.  Receives a data request, including a requestor identifier and an AccessKey.
    2.  Retrieves the relevant leaf node and Disclosure Policy.
    3.  Verifies the requestor’s AccessKey against the Disclosure Policy.
    4.  Checks if the current timestamp falls within the `StartTime` and `EndTime` window.
    5.  If both checks pass, the Access Validator returns a 'proof' derived from the retained hash, permitting decryption or access to the data. Otherwise, access is denied.
*   **Key Rotation Mechanism:**  A secure key rotation protocol integrated with the journal. New AccessKeys are generated and incorporated into the Disclosure Policy. The old AccessKey is archived for audit purposes but is no longer valid for new access requests. A cryptographic 'bridge' using the old and new keys facilitates access during the transition period.
*   **Digest Calculation:** The digest node hash calculation now incorporates not only the retained hash values of leaf nodes but also a Merkle Tree representing the current Disclosure Policies. This ensures that any tampering with the access rules is detectable in the digest.

**Pseudocode (Access Validator):**

```
function validateAccess(requestorId, accessKey, leafNode):
  disclosurePolicy = leafNode.disclosurePolicy
  currentTime = getCurrentTimestamp()

  if (currentTime < disclosurePolicy.startTime or currentTime > disclosurePolicy.endTime):
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  if (accessKey != disclosurePolicy.accessKey):
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  // Verify proof derived from retained hash (implementation detail)
  proof = generateProof(leafNode.hashValue, accessKey)

  return ACCESS_GRANTED, proof
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Secure Supply Chain:** Proof of product authenticity and origin, with access granted to specific parties at designated stages.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:**  Automated auditing of data access and modifications, ensuring adherence to data privacy regulations.
*   **Digital Rights Management:** Controlled access to digital content based on licensing agreements and time-limited permissions.
*   **Secure Voting Systems:**  Immutable record of votes with verifiable access controls.
