## Modular, Variable-Density Corrugated Inserts for Irregularly Shaped Objects

**Concept:** Expand upon the corrugated paper insert idea by creating a system of interlocking, geometrically variable modules. These modules aren’t pre-cut for specific objects, but rather assemble *around* an object, forming a custom cradle. Density of corrugation (flute size & frequency) can be varied *within* the module itself to provide targeted cushioning.

**Specifications:**

*   **Module Geometry:** Primarily utilize pentagonal and hexagonal modules. These shapes allow for tessellation and adaptable curvature. Module edges have interlocking ‘snap-fit’ tabs & slots.
*   **Material:** Multi-layer corrugated cardboard. Inner layers can use finer flute densities for delicate items, outer layers coarser flute for structural support. Bio-plastic composite reinforcement strips embedded within cardboard at key stress points.
*   **Variable Density:** Each module comprises multiple corrugated 'slices' stacked and bonded.  Slices can have varying flute densities (e.g., 1.5x, 2x, 3x the standard flute count) dictated by a pre-programmed ‘cushioning profile’ or user input (see Software Integration below).
*   **Assembly Protocol:**
    1.  Place object to be packaged on a flat surface.
    2.  Begin assembling modules around object, starting at the base. Modules interlock with each other.
    3.  ‘Pressure mapping’ sensors (integrated within modules) provide feedback on contact points and pressure distribution.  Software adjusts module placement & density to optimize cushioning.
    4.  Once assembled, a top ‘cap’ module secures the structure.
*   **Software Integration:**
    *   **Object Scanning:** Utilize a 3D scanner (integrated into packing station) to create a digital model of the object.
    *   **Cushioning Profile Generation:** Software analyzes the object’s geometry and fragility to generate an optimal cushioning profile – dictating flute density distribution and module placement.
    *   **Automated Module Selection:** Based on the cushioning profile, the system automatically selects the appropriate modules from a stock.
    *   **Pressure Mapping Calibration:** Software calibrates the pressure mapping sensors within the modules to ensure accurate data collection.
*   **Module Dimensions:** Standard module side length: 10cm, 15cm, 20cm. Variable thickness: 1cm to 5cm (determined by number of stacked corrugated slices).
*   **Interface:** Touchscreen control panel for manual override of automated functions.  Data logging of packing parameters for quality control.
*   **Sustainability:** Modules are designed for disassembly and reuse. Corrugated cardboard is sourced from recycled materials. Bio-plastic composite materials are biodegradable.
