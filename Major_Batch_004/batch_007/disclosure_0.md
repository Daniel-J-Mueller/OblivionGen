## Secure Hardware Attestation & Dynamic Root of Trust Provisioning

**System Overview:** A system enabling dynamic root of trust provisioning and continuous hardware attestation beyond initial boot, leveraging a combination of physically unclonable function (PUF) technology, secure enclaves, and a distributed ledger. This goes beyond simply verifying boot firmware; it establishes a continuously verifiable chain of trust for runtime code and data integrity.

**Core Components:**

1.  **PUF-based Device Identity:** Each host computing device incorporates a PUF. The PUF generates a unique, unclonable “fingerprint” based on inherent manufacturing variations. This fingerprint is never stored; it’s generated on demand.
2.  **Secure Enclave with Attestation Key:** A secure enclave within each host device holds a unique attestation key derived from the PUF fingerprint. This key is used for signing attestations.
3.  **Distributed Ledger (DLT) – “Trust Registry”:** A permissioned DLT stores publicly verifiable attestations and associated metadata. This isn't a cryptocurrency blockchain; it's optimized for storing attestations and revocation lists.
4.  **Attestation Service (AS):** A central service responsible for receiving, verifying, and storing attestations on the DLT.
5.  **Dynamic Root of Trust Manager (DRTM):** Software responsible for measuring and loading runtime code segments and establishing a chain of trust beyond the initial boot process.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Enrollment:** During manufacturing, the host device is enrolled with the Attestation Service. The PUF fingerprint is *not* transmitted. Instead, the device demonstrates knowledge of the PUF fingerprint by signing a challenge using a key derived from it, establishing initial trust.
2.  **Runtime Attestation:** Periodically (or on-demand), the DRTM measures the currently executing code segment (e.g., kernel modules, application code). This measurement is a cryptographic hash.
3.  **Attestation Report Generation:** The secure enclave signs an attestation report containing:
    *   The code segment hash.
    *   A timestamp.
    *   A device identifier (derived from the PUF).
    *   A signature using the enclave's attestation key.
4.  **Attestation Submission:** The attestation report is submitted to the Attestation Service.
5.  **Attestation Verification:** The Attestation Service verifies:
    *   The signature on the attestation report using the device's public key (associated with the device identifier and initially established during enrollment).
    *   That the device is not revoked (checking a revocation list on the DLT).
6.  **Trust Registry Update:** If the attestation is valid, the code segment hash and timestamp are recorded on the DLT, extending the chain of trust.
7.  **Continuous Verification:** Any entity can query the DLT to verify the integrity of the host device's runtime code, ensuring that it hasn’t been tampered with.

**Pseudocode (DRTM - Core Logic):**

```
function measureCodeSegment(segmentAddress, segmentSize):
  hash = calculateHash(segmentAddress, segmentSize)
  return hash

function generateAttestation(hash, timestamp, deviceID):
  attestationReport = {
    "hash": hash,
    "timestamp": timestamp,
    "deviceID": deviceID
  }
  signature = sign(attestationReport, enclaveKey)
  return {
    "report": attestationReport,
    "signature": signature
  }

function attestCodeSegment():
  segmentHash = measureCodeSegment(currentSegmentAddress, currentSegmentSize)
  attestation = generateAttestation(segmentHash, getCurrentTimestamp(), deviceID)
  submitAttestation(attestation)
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   PUF protection against physical attacks is critical.
*   Secure enclave must be hardened against side-channel attacks.
*   DLT needs to be protected against Sybil attacks and data tampering.
*   Regular rotation of attestation keys.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Supply chain security for software and hardware.
*   Remote device management and access control.
*   Secure cloud computing.
*   IoT device authentication and authorization.
