## Dynamic Task Decomposition & Skill-Based Micro-Task Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the multi-lingual task framework to support *dynamic decomposition* of larger tasks into micro-tasks, assessed & allocated based on evolving performer skill profiles, rather than pre-defined qualifications. This aims to optimize task completion time and cost by leveraging latent skills within the performer pool.

**Specs:**

*   **Task Decomposition Engine:**
    *   Input: Complex task description (text, multimedia).
    *   Process: Utilize a combination of NLP (Natural Language Processing) and potentially computer vision to identify constituent sub-tasks.  Sub-tasks are defined with associated ‘skill tags’ (e.g., ‘data entry’, ‘image labeling’, ‘sentiment analysis’, ‘translation – English to Spanish’, ‘factual verification – historical data’).
    *   Output:  Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representing task decomposition.  Nodes = sub-tasks. Edges = dependencies.  Each node tagged with skill requirements.
*   **Performer Skill Profiler:**
    *   Data Sources:
        *   Task completion history (existing system data).
        *   Micro-assessments: Short, dynamically generated tests to evaluate skill proficiency. Tests adapt difficulty based on performance.
        *   Self-reported skill levels (weighted lower than objective data).
        *   Peer review/validation of skills (optional, gamified system).
    *   Process: Bayesian updating of skill proficiency scores for each performer, based on all data sources.  Skills represented as continuous values (e.g., 0-100) rather than binary qualifications.
*   **Micro-Task Allocation Algorithm:**
    *   Input: DAG from Task Decomposition Engine, Performer Skill Profiles, Task priority/deadline, Cost constraints.
    *   Process:
        *   Optimization function: Minimize total task completion time/cost, subject to dependency constraints and skill matching.
        *   Allocation strategy:  Assign micro-tasks to performers with the *highest predicted performance* for that specific task, factoring in:
            *   Skill proficiency score.
            *   Task complexity.
            *   Performer workload (avoid overload).
            *   Performer language preference.
        *   Dynamic Re-Allocation: Monitor task progress. If a performer is underperforming or delayed, automatically re-allocate the task to another qualified performer.
*   **User Interface (Performer Side):**
    *   Personalized Task Feed: Prioritized list of available micro-tasks, matched to performer skills and language preferences.
    *   Micro-Assessment Portal: Access to short skill assessments to expand skill profile and unlock higher-paying tasks.
    *   Progress Tracking:  Visualization of completed tasks, earnings, and skill growth.
*   **Language Integration:**
    *   All task descriptions and instructions dynamically translated into performer’s preferred language.
    *   Micro-assessment content localized for each language.
    *   Optional:  Language skill tagged and prioritized for tasks requiring translation/localization.

**Pseudocode (Allocation Algorithm):**

```
function allocate_tasks(task_dag, performer_profiles):
  for each task in task_dag:
    eligible_performers = []
    for each performer in performer_profiles:
      if performer.skills contains task.required_skills:
        eligible_performers.append(performer)

    if eligible_performers is empty:
      // Handle case where no qualified performer is found (e.g., request training, relax requirements)

    best_performer = find_best_performer(eligible_performers, task)  // based on skill score, workload, etc.
    assign_task(task, best_performer)
```

**Novelty:**  Current systems rely on pre-defined qualifications. This system *dynamically discovers* performer skills and optimizes allocation in real-time, potentially unlocking hidden capacity within the workforce.  The dynamic task decomposition further enhances flexibility and efficiency.
