## Adaptive Manifest Generation & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the caching system to not just handle differing indexing *types* but also dynamically generate and utilize simplified/optimized manifests tailored to client device capabilities *before* a request is even made. This aims to reduce initial latency and bandwidth consumption, especially for devices with limited processing power or network connectivity.

**Specs:**

**1. Device Capability Profiling Module:**

*   **Input:** Client request header (User-Agent, accepted codecs, screen resolution, estimated bandwidth).
*   **Process:**  Maintains a database of device profiles, categorized by capabilities. If a new device is encountered, a basic profile is created based on the initial request. This profile is updated based on observed performance.
*   **Output:**  Device Capability Profile (e.g., {codec_support: [h264, av1], resolution_max: 1920x1080, bandwidth_estimate: 5Mbps, processing_power: low}).

**2. Manifest Generator:**

*   **Input:** Original media manifest (e.g., DASH MPD, HLS Playlist), Device Capability Profile.
*   **Process:** 
    *   Analyzes the original manifest to identify available fragments and quality levels.
    *   Dynamically generates a simplified manifest containing only fragments and quality levels compatible with the target device.
    *   Optimizes the fragment list based on predicted playback patterns (see Predictive Prefetching).
    *   Generates a unique identifier for the simplified manifest based on the original manifest hash and the Device Capability Profile.
*   **Output:** Simplified Manifest (e.g., DASH MPD, HLS Playlist), Manifest Identifier.

**3. Predictive Prefetching Module:**

*   **Input:** Playback History (aggregated from all clients), Current Playback Position, Simplified Manifest.
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyzes playback history to identify common playback patterns and predict which fragments are likely to be requested next.
    *   Prioritizes fragments for prefetching based on the predicted probability of request and network conditions.
    *   Dynamically adjusts prefetching behavior based on real-time feedback from the client (e.g., buffering events).
*   **Output:** Prefetch Queue (list of fragments to prefetch).

**4. Edge Server Integration:**

*   **Caching:** Edge server caches both original fragments *and* simplified manifests.  Cache keys for simplified manifests include the original manifest hash, the Device Capability Profile, and a version number.
*   **Request Handling:**
    1.  Receive client request.
    2.  Identify Device Capability Profile.
    3.  Check cache for corresponding simplified manifest.
    4.  If not found, generate simplified manifest using Manifest Generator and cache it.
    5.  Serve simplified manifest to the client.
    6.  Prefetch fragments according to the Prefetch Queue.
    7.  Serve fragments as requested.
*   **Manifest Versioning:** Implement a versioning mechanism for simplified manifests to ensure consistency and allow for updates. This could be a simple integer counter that is incremented whenever the original manifest is updated or the device profile changes.



**Pseudocode (Edge Server Request Handling):**

```
function handle_request(request):
    device_profile = get_device_profile(request)
    manifest_key = generate_manifest_key(original_manifest_hash, device_profile)

    if simplified_manifest in cache and cache_valid(simplified_manifest):
        serve_manifest(simplified_manifest)
    else:
        simplified_manifest = generate_simplified_manifest(original_manifest, device_profile)
        cache_manifest(simplified_manifest, manifest_key)
        serve_manifest(simplified_manifest)

    prefetch_queue = get_prefetch_queue(simplified_manifest, current_playback_position)
    prefetch_fragments(prefetch_queue)

    serve_fragments_as_requested()
```
