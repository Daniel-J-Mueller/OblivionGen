## Adaptive Task Composition via Predictive Sharding

**Concept:** Expand upon the sharding concept by introducing predictive sharding based on task dependencies *before* task arrival. This allows for pre-composition of tasks into 'logical units' anticipating future workload, dramatically reducing aggregation latency.

**Specification:**

**I. Components:**

*   **Dependency Analyzer:** Continuously monitors incoming task requests (or a sample stream) to build a dependency graph. Identifies common task sequences or 'logical units'.  This is not a runtime analysis, but a proactive one.
*   **Predictive Shard Manager:**  Based on the dependency graph, dynamically adjusts shard assignments.  Instead of simply assigning tasks to shards, it assigns *predicted task sequences* (logical units) to shards.  Shards are optimized for the types of sequences they are likely to receive.
*   **Pre-Composition Engine:**  A component within the Job Transformer. When a task arrives, it identifies its place within a predicted logical unit. Instead of waiting for all tasks in the unit to arrive, it *immediately* begins pre-composing the job, anticipating the arrival of remaining tasks.
*   **Dynamic Shard Balancing:** Monitors shard workload, but prioritizes balancing *logical unit* completion over individual task distribution. This prevents partially completed logical units from causing bottlenecks.
*   **Stateful Shards:** Shards maintain a small buffer to hold anticipated tasks within a logical unit, reducing communication overhead.

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Dependency Analysis:** The Dependency Analyzer runs continuously, mapping task relationships.
2.  **Shard Prediction:** The Predictive Shard Manager uses the dependency graph to forecast upcoming workload. It then adjusts shard assignments, aligning shards with likely logical units.
3.  **Task Arrival & Pre-Composition:** When a task arrives:
    *   The Job Transformer identifies the logical unit the task belongs to.
    *   The Pre-Composition Engine *immediately* begins assembling the job, even if other tasks in the unit haven't arrived.
    *   Anticipated tasks are prefetched/buffered within the associated shard.
4.  **Job Completion & Scheduling:** Once all tasks within the logical unit are available (or a threshold is reached), the job is complete and submitted to the Job Manager.
5.  **Dynamic Balancing:** The Dynamic Shard Balancing system monitors job completion rates and redistributes logical units to alleviate bottlenecks.

**III. Pseudocode (Pre-Composition Engine):**

```pseudocode
function preComposeJob(task):
  logicalUnit = determineLogicalUnit(task)
  shard = findShardForLogicalUnit(logicalUnit)

  if logicalUnit.isComplete():
    job = createJob(logicalUnit.tasks)
    return job

  logicalUnit.addTask(task)
  
  if logicalUnit.isNearCompletionThreshold():
    prefetchTasks(logicalUnit.anticipatedTasks)

  return logicalUnit //Return incomplete logical unit for tracking
```

**IV. Novelty & Benefits:**

*   Moves beyond reactive task aggregation to *proactive* job composition.
*   Reduces latency by starting job assembly before all tasks arrive.
*   Optimizes shard utilization by aligning shards with predicted workload.
*   Increases throughput by minimizing communication overhead.
*   Provides a framework for prioritizing task sequences based on business logic (e.g., critical path analysis).
