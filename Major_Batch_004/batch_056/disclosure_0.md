## Dynamic Query Decomposition & Contextual Expansion

**Core Concept:**  Instead of *refining* a single query, the system dynamically *decomposes* user queries into multiple, interconnected sub-queries, each exploring a facet of the user’s intent. These sub-queries are then expanded *contextually* based on real-time user behavior and external knowledge graphs.

**Specs:**

**1. Query Decomposition Engine:**

*   **Input:** Raw user query (text string).
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilize a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify key entities and concepts within the query.
    *   Employ a dependency parsing model to analyze the relationships between these entities.
    *   Based on the identified entities and relationships, *automatically generate* a set of related sub-queries. (e.g., User Query: “red running shoes”.  Sub-queries: "red shoes", "running shoes", "athletic footwear", "shoes for marathon", "shoes for trail running").  The system should *intelligently* prioritize sub-query generation based on probabilities – for example, it should know that “running shoes” is a far more likely sub-query than "shoes for competitive synchronized swimming".
    *   Each sub-query should be tagged with a 'relevance score' based on the original query, and the relationships between entities.

**2. Contextual Expansion Module:**

*   **Input:** Sub-query, relevance score, user interaction data (browsing history, purchase history, dwell time on results, explicit feedback).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Real-time User Behavior Analysis:** Monitor user interactions with search results in real-time. Track clicks, dwell time, scrolling behavior, and explicit feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down).
    *   **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Access a large-scale knowledge graph (e.g., Wikidata, Google Knowledge Graph) to identify related concepts, attributes, and entities.
    *   **Dynamic Attribute Generation:** Based on user behavior and knowledge graph data, *automatically generate* new attributes and modifiers for each sub-query. (e.g., if the user consistently clicks on "trail running shoes," add attributes like "rugged outsole," "waterproof," or "high ankle support").
    *   **Query Rewriting:**  Rewrites sub-queries dynamically using the generated attributes and modifiers.  (e.g., "running shoes" becomes "lightweight running shoes for pavement" or "durable trail running shoes with ankle support”).

**3. Multi-Result Presentation Layer:**

*   **Output:** Dynamically generated search results for each sub-query, presented in a layered or faceted interface.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Faceted Navigation:** Allow users to filter and refine results based on the generated attributes.
    *   **Query Interlinking:**  Visually connect related sub-queries and results to show the relationships between different facets of the user’s intent.
    *   **Adaptive Ranking:** Rank results based on both relevance to the original query and the user’s demonstrated preferences.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function process_query(user_query):
  sub_queries = generate_sub_queries(user_query)
  for sub_query in sub_queries:
    context = analyze_user_context()
    expanded_query = expand_query(sub_query, context)
    results = search(expanded_query)
    display_results(results, sub_query)
```

**Novelty:**

This differs from the provided patent by not *refining* a single query, but *decomposing* it into multiple parallel searches. Furthermore, the contextual expansion isn't simply based on user interactions, but leverages real-time behavior *and* external knowledge graphs to *dynamically generate* new query attributes, resulting in a far more nuanced and personalized search experience. This offers the ability to explore the "latent" interests of the user which are not explicitly stated.
