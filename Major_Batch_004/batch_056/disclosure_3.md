## Dynamic Data Lineage Visualization & Predictive Risk Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the sensitive data detection and tracking to proactively visualize data lineage *and* predict potential data breaches based on observed access patterns and inferred data transformations. This moves beyond simple location identification to a dynamic risk assessment system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Lineage Graph Construction:**

*   **Input:** Source code (as in the patent), schemaless database schemas, runtime logs (access patterns, data modifications), and potentially data samples (for schema inference when source code is incomplete).
*   **Process:**
    *   Parse source code & database schemas to establish initial data flows.
    *   Continuously ingest runtime logs.
    *   Employ pattern recognition (and potentially machine learning) on log data to identify data transformations (e.g., aggregation, filtering, joining) that aren't explicitly defined in the source code. This handles dynamic query construction/modification.
    *   Construct a directed graph representing data lineage. Nodes represent data elements (fields, tables, schemas) and edges represent data flows.  Edge weight represents data transformation complexity/risk.
*   **Output:** A dynamic, up-to-date data lineage graph.  The graph should be stored in a graph database (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune).

**2. Predictive Risk Scoring:**

*   **Input:** Data Lineage Graph, Sensitive Data tags (from original patent functionality), Access Control Lists (ACLs), User Roles, Threat Intelligence Feeds.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Path Analysis:** Identify all paths in the lineage graph leading to sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Factor Assignment:** Assign risk scores to each edge and node based on:
        *   **Access Control Weaknesses:** Nodes/edges with overly permissive ACLs.
        *   **Transformation Complexity:**  More complex transformations increase the risk of unintended data exposure.
        *   **User Role Privileges:** Users with excessive privileges representing a greater risk.
        *   **Threat Intelligence Correlation:**  Link known vulnerabilities or attack patterns to specific data flows.
    *   **Risk Propagation:** Propagate risk scores along paths in the graph. Paths with high-risk factors and many hops contribute to a higher overall risk score for the sensitive data.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Monitor access patterns for deviations from established baselines. Use machine learning (e.g., autoencoders) to identify anomalous behavior that might indicate a breach in progress.
*   **Output:**
    *   **Risk Score:** A numerical score representing the overall risk to each piece of sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Path Visualization:**  A visual representation of the highest-risk paths leading to sensitive data, highlighting potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Alerts:** Real-time alerts triggered when risk scores exceed predefined thresholds or anomalous activity is detected.

**3. User Interface:**

*   **Interactive Graph Visualization:** Allow users to explore the data lineage graph, drill down into specific data flows, and view risk scores.
*   **Risk Dashboard:** Provide a high-level overview of the overall risk posture, highlighting the most vulnerable sensitive data.
*   **Remediation Recommendations:** Suggest actions to mitigate risk (e.g., tightening ACLs, simplifying data transformations, implementing multi-factor authentication).

**Pseudocode (Risk Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateRiskScore(sensitiveData, lineageGraph):
  paths = findPaths(lineageGraph, sensitiveData)
  totalRisk = 0
  for path in paths:
    pathRisk = 0
    for edge in path:
      pathRisk += edge.riskFactor 
    totalRisk += pathRisk
  return totalRisk
```

**New Features:**

*   **Automated Data Classification:**  Use machine learning to automatically identify and classify sensitive data based on content analysis.
*   **Data Masking & Encryption Recommendations:** Suggest appropriate data masking or encryption techniques to protect sensitive data.
*   **Integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems:**  Streamline security monitoring and incident response.
