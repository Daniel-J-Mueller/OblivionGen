## Dynamic Mesh Calibration for Augmented Reality Gantry Systems

**Concept:** Expand the calibration system beyond rigid target correlation to actively deform a projected mesh on the target surface, enabling calibration *and* real-time surface adaptation for AR experiences. This moves beyond purely geometric calibration to account for non-rigid targets or dynamic environments.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Gantry Platform:** Existing two-axis rotational gantry platform (pan/tilt) with integrated image sensor and light projector.
*   **Target Surface:** Any visible surface, potentially non-rigid (fabric, organic material, etc.).
*   **Projected Mesh Generator:** Software module generating a deformable mesh based on initial target geometry estimates.  The mesh is composed of controllable vertices.
*   **Vertex Control System:**  Algorithms driving the light projector to illuminate individual vertices of the projected mesh.  Intensity and color can be modulated per vertex.
*   **Image Analysis Module:** Processes captured images to identify illuminated vertices, measuring their observed positions.
*   **Deformation Solver:**  A physics-based or optimization-based solver that adjusts the mesh vertex positions to minimize the difference between projected and observed vertex locations.  This creates a dynamic, calibrated mesh.
*   **AR Content Engine:** Accepts the dynamic mesh as a base for AR content projection and rendering.
*   **Calibration Modes:**
    *   *Static Calibration:* Initial mesh creation and calibration.
    *   *Dynamic Calibration:* Continuous mesh refinement during AR operation.
    *   *Surface Tracking:* Detect and adapt to surface deformations.

**Pseudocode - Dynamic Calibration Loop:**

```
// Initialization
Create initial mesh (estimate target geometry)
Project mesh vertices onto target surface using light projector
Capture image with image sensor

// Calibration Loop
while (AR application running) {
    // Project mesh vertices onto target surface
    For Each vertex in mesh {
        Set light projector to illuminate vertex
        Capture image
        Detect illuminated vertex in image
        Calculate observed vertex position
    }

    // Calculate error between projected and observed vertex positions
    Calculate error vector for each vertex

    // Apply Deformation Solver
    Adjust mesh vertex positions to minimize error vector
    (Physics-based or Optimization-based Solver)

    // Update AR Content Rendering
    Render AR content onto the deformed mesh
}
```

**Component Breakdown:**

1.  **Light Projector Control:** Precise control of the projector's beam to accurately illuminate individual mesh vertices. Requires accurate projector model and calibration.

2.  **Image Analysis:** Robust vertex detection algorithm, handling noise, occlusion, and varying lighting conditions. Utilizes computer vision techniques like feature detection (e.g., corners, edges) and color filtering.

3.  **Deformation Solver:** Implement either:
    *   *Physics-based Solver:* Model the target surface as a deformable material (e.g., spring-mass system) and simulate its response to external forces.
    *   *Optimization-based Solver:* Formulate an optimization problem that minimizes the error between projected and observed vertex positions, subject to constraints on surface smoothness and rigidity.

4.  **AR Content Engine Integration:**  Render AR content onto the deformed mesh. This requires mapping AR content coordinates to mesh vertex positions and adjusting the content based on mesh deformations.

**Novelty:**

Existing calibration methods focus on geometric accuracy. This system adds *dynamic* surface adaptation, enabling AR experiences on non-rigid targets or in dynamic environments. It combines calibration with real-time surface tracking and deformation modeling. This could enable AR applications like virtual draping of fabrics, medical simulations on deformable tissue models, or interactive projections onto living organisms.
