## HSM-Based Decentralized Identity Attestation

**Concept:** Leverage the HSM’s secure key storage and cryptographic capabilities to create a decentralized identity attestation system, allowing devices or entities to prove claims about themselves without relying on centralized authorities. This builds upon the existing key management features, but shifts the focus from solely synchronizing keys *within* a cluster to establishing trust *between* potentially disparate HSMs.

**Specs:**

1.  **Attestation Key Pair Generation:** Each HSM generates a unique attestation key pair (public/private). The private key *never* leaves the HSM. The public key is registered on a distributed ledger (blockchain or similar).

2.  **Claim Encoding:** Claims about an entity (e.g., “Device Model: X”, “Firmware Version: Y”, “Trusted Platform Module Present: True”) are encoded into a structured data format (JSON, Protocol Buffers).

3.  **Signed Attestation:**
    *   The entity (device, server, etc.) requests an attestation from the HSM.
    *   The HSM receives the claim data.
    *   The HSM signs the claim data using its attestation private key.
    *   The HSM returns the signed attestation to the entity.

4.  **Verification Process:**
    *   A verifier (e.g., a service attempting to authenticate a device) receives the signed attestation.
    *   The verifier retrieves the corresponding HSM’s public key from the distributed ledger.
    *   The verifier uses the HSM’s public key to verify the signature on the attestation.
    *   If the signature is valid, the verifier trusts the claims within the attestation.

5.  **Key Rotation & Revocation:** Implement mechanisms for rotating HSM attestation keys and revoking compromised keys. This could involve:
    *   Periodic key rotation schedules.
    *   A revocation list maintained on the distributed ledger.
    *   Timestamping attestation signatures to limit their validity window.

6.  **HSM Cluster Integration (Optional):**  The system can utilize the existing HSM cluster synchronization features to distribute and update revocation lists across multiple HSMs, enhancing resilience and scalability.

**Pseudocode (HSM Side - Attestation Request Handling):**

```
function handleAttestationRequest(claimData):
  if (HSM is compromised OR key is revoked):
    return ERROR_COMPROMISED

  attestationSignature = sign(claimData, HSM.attestationPrivateKey)

  return attestationSignature
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ClaimData`:  JSON/Protocol Buffers containing structured claim information.
*   `AttestationSignature`:  Cryptographic signature generated by the HSM.
*   `HSMRegistrationRecord`:  Entry on the distributed ledger containing HSM identifier and attestation public key.
*   `RevocationList`:  List of revoked HSM identifiers.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   HSM with secure key storage and cryptographic capabilities.
*   Network connectivity for accessing the distributed ledger.

**Software Requirements:**

*   HSM firmware supporting the attestation protocol.
*   Software component for interacting with the distributed ledger.
*   Verifier software for validating attestations.
