## Dynamic Challenge Weighting & Behavioral Biometrics Integration

**System Specifications:**

**Core Concept:** Augment confidence scoring with real-time behavioral biometric analysis to dynamically adjust the weighting of authentication challenges, creating a layered and adaptive authentication system.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Biometric Sensor Suite:**
    *   Keystroke Dynamics: Capture timing, pressure, and patterns of keystrokes.
    *   Mouse/Touchpad Movement: Track speed, acceleration, patterns, and pressure (if applicable).
    *   Device Orientation/Motion (Mobile): Utilize accelerometer and gyroscope data.
    *   (Optional) Voice/Facial Recognition: Integrate existing modalities for additional data points.

2.  **Real-Time Analysis Engine:**
    *   Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize raw sensor data.
    *   Feature Extraction: Identify relevant behavioral patterns (e.g., keystroke rhythm, mouse acceleration profiles).
    *   Anomaly Detection: Utilize machine learning models (e.g., autoencoders, one-class SVMs) to detect deviations from established user baselines.
    *   Risk Score Generation: Calculate a continuous risk score based on detected anomalies, ranging from low (normal behavior) to high (suspicious activity).

3.  **Dynamic Challenge Weighting Module:**
    *   Baseline Establishment: During initial setup/learning phase, establish behavioral baselines for each user.
    *   Real-Time Adjustment:  Continuously monitor the risk score generated by the Real-Time Analysis Engine.
    *   Challenge Weighting Algorithm:
        *   Low Risk (Score < Threshold 1): Use standard challenge weighting (as defined in the base patent).
        *   Medium Risk (Threshold 1 <= Score < Threshold 2): Increase the weight of challenges known to be resistant to automated attacks (e.g., challenges requiring complex cognitive processing, visual pattern recognition).  Introduce challenges that require slightly more user effort.
        *   High Risk (Score >= Threshold 2): Significantly increase the weight of high-security challenges. Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) if not already enabled. Temporarily lock account pending further verification if risk score remains high.

4.  **Challenge Database:**
    *   Categorization: Challenges are categorized by security level (low, medium, high), attack resistance (easy to automate, difficult to automate), cognitive load (low, medium, high), and accessibility.
    *   Dynamic Selection: Algorithm selects challenges based on current risk score and user profile (accessibility requirements, preferred challenge types).

**Pseudocode - Dynamic Challenge Weighting Algorithm:**

```
function selectChallenges(userProfile, riskScore) {
    // Define risk thresholds
    lowRiskThreshold = 0.2
    mediumRiskThreshold = 0.6

    // Calculate base weight for each challenge type
    baseWeights = {
        "simpleQuestion": 1,
        "visualPuzzle": 2,
        "cognitiveTest": 3,
        "securityQuestion": 1.5
    }

    // Adjust weights based on risk score
    if (riskScore < lowRiskThreshold) {
        challengeWeights = baseWeights // Use standard weights
    } else if (riskScore < mediumRiskThreshold) {
        // Increase weights of harder challenges
        challengeWeights = {
            "simpleQuestion": 0.8,
            "visualPuzzle": 2.5,
            "cognitiveTest": 4,
            "securityQuestion": 1.8
        }
    } else {
        // Activate high-security mode
        challengeWeights = {
            "simpleQuestion": 0.5,
            "visualPuzzle": 3,
            "cognitiveTest": 5,
            "securityQuestion": 2.5
        }
        // Trigger MFA if not already enabled
        enableMFA(userProfile)
    }

    // Select challenges based on weights and user preferences
    selectedChallenges = selectChallengesByWeight(challengeWeights, userProfile)

    return selectedChallenges
}
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  User attempts to authenticate.
2.  Behavioral biometrics data is collected in real-time.
3.  Real-Time Analysis Engine processes data and generates a risk score.
4.  Dynamic Challenge Weighting Module adjusts challenge weights based on risk score.
5.  System selects and presents authentication challenges.
6.  User responds to challenges.
7.  Confidence score is calculated (as in the base patent), incorporating challenge weights.
8.  Authentication is either granted or denied.

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static challenge weighting and integrates real-time behavioral biometrics to dynamically adjust the security level of authentication. This creates a more adaptive and robust system that can respond to evolving threats and user behavior.
