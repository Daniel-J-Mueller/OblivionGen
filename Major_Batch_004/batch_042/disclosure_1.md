## Dynamic Call Route "Sculpting" via Predictive Network Congestion

**Concept:** Instead of solely reacting to *past* call quality data, proactively shape call routes based on *predicted* network congestion using real-time data streams and machine learning. This moves beyond simply selecting the "best" of existing routes to *dynamically influencing* route availability and capacity *before* a call is even established.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Ingestion Layer:**

*   **Sources:**
    *   Real-time network performance data from ISPs/Carriers (API access, aggregated anonymized data feeds).  Metrics: Latency, Jitter, Packet Loss, Bandwidth Utilization, Congestion Indicators.
    *   Geolocation Data: Caller & Callee location (approximated to city/region level for privacy).
    *   Historical Call Data:  The system’s existing call quality data (from the provided patent’s framework).
    *   External Event Data: Publicly available event schedules (concerts, sporting events) that may impact network load in specific areas.
*   **Format:**  Standardized data schemas (JSON, Protocol Buffers) for efficient processing.
*   **Frequency:**  Data streams updated at minimum every 5 seconds, ideally sub-second.

**2. Predictive Modeling Engine:**

*   **Algorithm:**  Time Series Forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks).  Model trained on historical network data and real-time feeds.
*   **Output:**  Probabilistic forecasts of network congestion levels for different geographic regions and network paths.  Output includes confidence intervals.
*   **Granularity:**  Congestion predictions at the level of network nodes (routers, switches) and specific network segments.
*   **Dynamic Retraining:**  Models retrained continuously using Bayesian methods to adapt to changing network conditions.

**3. Route "Sculpting" Mechanism:**

*   **Virtual Route Creation:** The system can dynamically *allocate* or *de-allocate* virtual network resources (bandwidth, capacity) to create temporary “sculpted” routes. This would require agreements with network providers.
*   **Route Prioritization:** Routes are ranked not just by historical quality, but by predicted future congestion levels. Lower predicted congestion = higher priority.
*   **Cost Negotiation:**  The system can negotiate bandwidth pricing with different carriers in real-time to secure optimal capacity at the lowest cost, taking into account predicted demand.  (Auction-based pricing model).
*   **Pre-emptive Route Setup:**  For anticipated high-volume calls (e.g., scheduled conference calls), the system can pre-emptively reserve bandwidth and establish routes before the call begins.
*   **Traffic Shunting:**  Dynamically redirect traffic from congested routes to underutilized routes, even if it means slightly longer path lengths.

**4. System Integration:**

*   **API Interface:**  Seamless integration with existing call routing infrastructure (as described in the patent).
*   **Dashboard & Monitoring:**  Real-time visualization of network congestion, route performance, and cost savings.
*   **Alerting System:**  Automated alerts for critical network events or unexpected congestion spikes.



**Pseudocode (Route Selection):**

```
function selectRoute(callerLocation, calleeLocation, callPriority):
  // 1. Predict congestion for all potential routes
  routeCongestion = predictRouteCongestion(callerLocation, calleeLocation)

  // 2. Get historical call quality data
  historicalQuality = getHistoricalCallQuality(route)

  // 3. Calculate combined score
  score = (historicalQuality * weightHistorical) + (routeCongestion * weightCongestion)

  // 4. Apply priority adjustment
  if (callPriority == "high"):
    score = score + priorityBoost

  // 5. Select route with highest score
  bestRoute = selectRouteWithMaxScore(routeList)

  return bestRoute
```
