## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Cover - "SenseSkin"

**Concept:** Expand the visual indicator concept to incorporate advanced haptic feedback, creating a cover that *feels* different based on device conditions, providing a more intuitive and nuanced user experience. The cover doesn't just *show* you information, it *tells* you.

**Specifications:**

*   **Material:** Multi-layered flexible polymer incorporating an array of microfluidic channels and piezoelectric actuators. Outer layer is durable, scratch-resistant, and aesthetically customizable.
*   **Actuator Density:** Minimum 50 actuators per 100 square centimeters. Higher density for areas frequently touched (edges, corners).
*   **Microfluidic System:** Channels embedded within the cover, filled with a non-conductive, biocompatible fluid. Fluid circulation controlled by micro-pumps.
*   **Communication Interface:** Wireless (Bluetooth Low Energy) connection to the handheld device. Supports bidirectional communication for data transmission and control.
*   **Power Source:** Integrated, flexible battery with wireless charging capability. Battery life: minimum 24 hours under normal usage.
*   **Haptic Profiles:** Predefined haptic profiles corresponding to various device states:
    *   **Security Mode:** Rapid, pulsing vibrations along edges if a security breach is detected.
    *   **User Mode:** Subtle texture changes via microfluidic control. (e.g., a 'smooth' feel for work mode, a 'ridged' feel for gaming mode).
    *   **Notifications:** Distinct vibration patterns for different app notifications. (e.g., short burst for text message, long ripple for email).
    *   **Battery Level:** Gradual increase in actuator activation intensity as battery depletes. (simulating 'warmth' when full, 'coolness' when low).
    *   **Application State:** Distinct textures or vibrations based on running app category. (e.g., 'flowing' sensation for video streaming, 'sharp' taps for a timer).
*   **Customization:** Companion app allows users to:
    *   Create custom haptic profiles.
    *   Assign specific haptic feedback to individual apps.
    *   Adjust intensity and patterns of haptic feedback.
*   **Attachment Mechanism:** Secure, non-damaging clip or magnetic system compatible with a wide range of handheld devices.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Control):**

  // Retrieve battery level from device
  // Return a value between 0 and 100
}

  // Retrieve current user mode from device
  // Return a string representing the mode (e.g., "work", "gaming", "reading")
}

function getTextureForMode(mode) {
  // Based on the mode, return a texture identifier
  // (e.g., "smooth", "ridged", "bumpy")
}

function getNotificationHapticType(appName) {
  // Based on the app name, return a haptic pattern identifier
  // (e.g., "shortBurst", "longRipple", "doubleTap")
}

function activateHapticPattern(pattern, area) {
  // Control the microfluidic system and actuators
  // to create the specified haptic pattern in the specified area
}

function setCoverTexture(texture) {
  // Control the microfluidic system to change the texture
  // of the cover
}

function setHapticIntensity(intensity, area) {
  // Control the actuators to adjust the intensity of haptic feedback
  // in the specified area
}
