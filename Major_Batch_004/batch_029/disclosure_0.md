## Variable Geometry Phased Array Antenna

**Concept:** A phased array antenna utilizing micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) to dynamically adjust the physical length and orientation of radiating elements, enabling beam steering and shaping beyond traditional phase shifting methods. This builds on the folded monopole/planar inverted-F antenna concept, but extends it into a reconfigurable array.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Configuration:** NxM array of individually controllable radiating elements. N and M determine the array gain and steering range. (e.g., 8x8, 16x16).
*   **Radiating Element:** Modified version of the patent's folded monopole/planar inverted-F antenna. The "arms" (first and second conductors) are fabricated from a conductive material deposited on a flexible substrate (e.g., polyimide).
*   **Actuation Mechanism:** Each arm is connected to a MEMS actuator (e.g., piezoelectric bimorph, electrostatic actuator). Actuation allows for:
    *   **Length Variation:** Extending/retracting the arm length, tuning resonant frequency.
    *   **Angular Adjustment:** Rotating the arm's orientation for polarization control and beam steering.
*   **Control System:**
    *   **Microcontroller:** High-speed microcontroller for managing individual element control.
    *   **Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs):** Precision DACs to generate analog control voltages for the MEMS actuators.
    *   **Feedback System:** Capacitive sensors integrated into each element to provide real-time feedback on arm length and orientation. This allows for closed-loop control and precise beam shaping.
*   **Feed Network:** Microstrip feed network delivering RF signal to each element.  Utilize Wilkinson power dividers for impedance matching and signal distribution.
*   **Substrate:** Low-loss dielectric substrate (e.g., Rogers 4350B) for optimal RF performance.
*   **Power Requirements:** 3.3V or 5V DC power supply for control electronics.

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```
// Define array dimensions
int N = 8;
int M = 8;

// Define desired beam direction (azimuth, elevation)
float desiredAzimuth;
float desiredElevation;

// Calculate phase shifts for each element based on desired beam direction
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
    float phaseShift = calculatePhaseShift(i, j, desiredAzimuth, desiredElevation);
    setPhaseShift(i, j, phaseShift); // Drive DACs to apply phase shift
  }
}

// Function: calculatePhaseShift
// Inputs: element coordinates (i, j), desired azimuth, desired elevation
// Outputs: phase shift in degrees
// Implementation: Uses standard array steering formulas based on element spacing and wavelength.

// Function: setPhaseShift
// Inputs: element coordinates (i, j), phase shift in degrees
// Implementation: Converts phase shift to control voltage and sends it to the DAC for that element.
// Additionally, utilizes feedback from the capacitive sensors to adjust control voltage and achieve precise phase shift.
```

**Innovation:** The key difference from standard phased arrays is the *physical* adjustment of element length and orientation.  This allows for:

*   **Wider Bandwidth:**  By dynamically tuning element resonance, the antenna can maintain performance over a wider frequency range.
*   **Improved Beam Shaping:**  Physical element adjustments offer more precise control over the radiation pattern, enabling the creation of complex beam shapes for interference mitigation or targeted signal transmission.
*   **Polarization Agility:**  Rotating elements allows for dynamic polarization control, enhancing communication reliability and security.
*   **Smaller Form Factor:**  By physically adjusting element length, the overall antenna size can be reduced without sacrificing performance.
