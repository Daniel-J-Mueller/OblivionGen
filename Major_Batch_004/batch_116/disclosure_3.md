## Dynamic Topic Drift Detection & Personalized Review Summarization

**Concept:** Extend the existing topic extraction from search queries to *track topic evolution* over time, and then generate personalized review summaries based on a user’s individual topic preferences – essentially building a dynamic, user-specific review ‘lens’.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Source:** Customer review search queries (as in the patent) *plus* full text of customer reviews, product metadata (specifications, categories), and user profile data (purchase history, explicitly stated preferences, demographic data – optional).
*   **Topic Drift Module:**
    *   **Time Windowing:** Analyze search queries in sliding time windows (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
    *   **Topic Modeling:** Employ topic modeling (LDA, NMF, BERTopic) on each time window’s queries.
    *   **Topic Similarity:** Calculate similarity between topics across consecutive time windows (cosine similarity of topic vectors).
    *   **Drift Detection:**  Flag topics with significant similarity drops (below a threshold) as ‘drifting’.  This indicates a shift in customer concerns or product features being discussed.
    *   **New Topic Identification:**  Identify completely *new* topics emerging in recent windows (low similarity to all previous topics).
*   **Personalized Review Summarization Module:**
    *   **User Topic Profile:** Create a vector representing a user’s preferred topics, derived from their purchase history, explicitly stated preferences (if available), and interaction with existing reviews (clicks, ratings). Weight topics based on user engagement.
    *   **Review Topic Extraction:**  For each review, extract topics using topic modeling.
    *   **Relevance Scoring:** Calculate the relevance score between the review’s topic vector and the user’s topic profile.
    *   **Summary Generation:**  Using a sequence-to-sequence model (e.g., BART, T5), generate a personalized summary of the review, emphasizing sentences most relevant to the user’s preferred topics.  The model is trained on a dataset of reviews and summaries, with a ‘topic attention’ mechanism to focus on relevant topics.
*   **User Interface Integration:**
    *   **Dynamic Topic Filters:**  Display a list of current topics (detected by the Topic Drift Module) as filters in the review section.
    *   **Personalized Summary Toggle:**  Allow users to switch between a standard review summary and a personalized summary.
    *   **Topic Preference Settings:**  Provide a UI for users to explicitly state their preferred topics.
    *   **‘Emerging Concern’ Alerts:** Notify users when a new topic (potentially a negative issue) emerges in customer reviews for a product they own or are considering purchasing.

**Pseudocode (Personalized Summary Generation):**

```
function generate_personalized_summary(review_text, user_topic_profile):
  review_topic_vector = extract_topics(review_text)
  relevance_score = cosine_similarity(review_topic_vector, user_topic_profile)
  
  # Use a sequence-to-sequence model with topic attention
  summary = sequence_to_sequence_model(review_text, relevance_score)
  
  return summary
```

**Novelty:**  This extends topic extraction beyond simply identifying current concerns. It proactively tracks *changes* in customer sentiment and dynamically adapts review presentation to individual user preferences. The combination of topic drift detection and personalized summarization provides a more nuanced and informative user experience.
