## Dynamic Network Topology Prediction & Pre-Provisioning

**Concept:** Extend the existing system by *predicting* network topology changes *before* they occur, and proactively pre-provisioning devices within the predicted topology. This moves beyond reactive configuration to anticipatory management, improving network responsiveness and reducing downtime.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Engine Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical network traffic data, device performance metrics (CPU, memory, bandwidth), scheduled maintenance windows, application deployment schedules, external data feeds (e.g., weather, news events that might impact connectivity).
*   **Algorithm:** Employ time-series forecasting techniques (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM neural networks) to predict network topology changes. These changes might include:
    *   Link failures/congestion based on historical patterns.
    *   Device additions/removals based on scheduled deployments.
    *   Traffic flow shifts based on application usage predictions.
*   **Output:** Probabilistic predictions of future network topologies, including:
    *   A ranked list of potential topology states.
    *   Confidence levels for each predicted state.
    *   Time horizon for each prediction.

**2. Pre-Provisioning Orchestrator:**

*   **Input:** Predicted network topologies (from Predictive Engine), current network configuration, device capabilities, service level agreements (SLAs).
*   **Logic:** Based on the predicted topologies and SLAs, generate pre-provisioning instructions for network devices. These instructions might include:
    *   Routing table updates.
    *   VLAN configuration changes.
    *   Firewall rule adjustments.
    *   QoS policy modifications.
*   **Staging Area:** Create a ‘staging area’ for pre-provisioned configurations. This could be a virtualized environment or a shadow configuration on the devices themselves.
*   **Activation Trigger:** Define activation triggers based on real-time network events. For example:
    *   Confirmation of a device addition/removal.
    *   Detection of a link failure.
    *   Significant traffic flow shift.

**3. Adaptive Validation & Rollback:**

*   **Canary Deployment:** When activating a pre-provisioned configuration, implement a canary deployment strategy. Route a small percentage of traffic through the newly configured devices to validate its correctness.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the performance of the network after activating the configuration. Track metrics such as latency, throughput, and packet loss.
*   **Automated Rollback:** If performance degrades or errors are detected, automatically rollback to the previous configuration.

**Pseudocode (Orchestrator):**

```
function preProvisionNetwork(predictedTopology, currentConfig, sla):
  configChanges = calculateConfigChanges(predictedTopology, currentConfig)
  stagingConfig = applyChanges(configChanges, currentConfig)
  validateStagingConfig(stagingConfig)
  storeStagingConfig(stagingConfig)

function activateStagingConfig(event):
  deployStagingConfig(event)
  monitorPerformance(deployedConfig)
  if performanceDegrades():
    rollbackToPreviousConfig()
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Topology State:**  Graph data structure representing the network topology, with nodes representing devices and edges representing links.  Each edge includes attributes such as bandwidth, latency, and cost.
*   **Configuration Delta:** A set of changes to the current network configuration, expressed as a diff or patch.
*   **Performance Profile:**  A time-series of performance metrics for each device and link in the network.
