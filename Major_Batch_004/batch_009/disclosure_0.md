## Dynamic Predictive Alert Zones – “Guardian”

**Concept:** Extend the zoned motion detection concept by *predicting* motion paths and preemptively adjusting alert and recording zones. This moves beyond simple perimeter detection to understand intended movement.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing A/V device with dual (or more) motion sensors.
    *   Low-resolution depth sensor (Time-of-Flight or similar) - integrated or external.
    *   Increased processing power (edge TPU or equivalent) for real-time path prediction.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Motion Trajectory Analysis Module:** Analyzes recent motion events (past 5-10 seconds) to predict likely paths. This uses basic physics (velocity, angle) and pattern recognition (common movement patterns – walking towards a door, approaching a vehicle).
    *   **Dynamic Zone Adjustment:** Based on predicted trajectory, the alert zone *expands* or *shifts* in anticipation of movement.  Example: If someone starts walking towards a door, the alert zone extends *beyond* the doorway, anticipating they will likely pass through it.
    *   **Confidence Levels:** Assigns a confidence level to each predicted path. Higher confidence triggers more aggressive zone adjustments. Lower confidence allows for more conservative adjustments.
    *   **User-Defined "Intent Filters":** Users can define common "intents" (e.g., "package delivery", "pet movement") and associate them with specific zone adjustment behaviors.
    *   **Learning Algorithm:** The system learns from user feedback (e.g., false alerts) to refine its prediction accuracy and zone adjustment strategies.
    *   **Multi-Sensor Fusion:** Combines data from all motion sensors *and* the depth sensor to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.
*   **Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
// Every frame:
1.  Get raw motion data from all sensors.
2.  Apply sensor fusion algorithm to create a unified motion map.
3.  Analyze motion map for recent movement (past N frames).
4.  Predict potential trajectories using trajectory prediction module.
5.  Calculate confidence levels for each trajectory.
6.  Adjust alert and recording zones dynamically based on:
    a. Predicted trajectory with highest confidence.
    b. User-defined intent filters.
    c. Current zone settings.
7.  Send adjusted zone parameters to the recording/alerting system.
8.  Log data for learning algorithm.
```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Enhanced home security - proactively monitor areas of interest.
    *   Smart retail - track customer movements and optimize store layout.
    *   Autonomous vehicles - predict pedestrian paths and improve safety.
    *   Elderly care - monitor movement patterns and detect falls or unusual behavior.
