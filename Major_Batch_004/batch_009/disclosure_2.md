## Dynamic Network Topology Mapping & Adaptive Authorization

**Concept:** Extend the authorization system to actively map and react to changes in the underlying network topology, improving security and performance. The current patent focuses on verifying source location *during* authorization. This builds on that by *learning* and *predicting* network shifts to preemptively adjust authorization parameters.

**Specs:**

**1. Network Topology Scanner Module (NTSM):**

*   **Function:** Continuously scans the intermediate network(s) for changes in topology â€“ new nodes, link failures, bandwidth fluctuations. Uses a combination of active probing (e.g., ICMP pings, traceroute) and passive monitoring of network traffic.
*   **Output:** Generates a real-time network topology map, represented as a graph data structure. Nodes represent network devices (routers, switches, virtual machines). Edges represent links, annotated with bandwidth, latency, and reliability metrics.  The map is time-stamped.
*   **Data Storage:** Stores historical topology maps to detect patterns and predict future changes. Uses a time-series database optimized for graph data.

**2. Predictive Authorization Engine (PAE):**

*   **Input:** Current & Historical Network Topology Maps (from NTSM), Authorization Policies (existing system), Real-time Communication Flows.
*   **Function:**  Uses machine learning (specifically, time-series forecasting and graph neural networks) to predict potential network disruptions and their impact on communication paths.
*   **Outputs:**  Dynamic authorization rules. These rules can include:
    *   Adjusted source location requirements based on predicted path changes.
    *   Temporary blocking of communication from potentially compromised nodes.
    *   Automatic rerouting of traffic through more secure paths.
    *   Adaptive trust scores for nodes based on their observed behavior and network context.

**3. Authorization Policy Manager (APM):**

*   **Function:** Integrates with the existing authorization system. Receives dynamic authorization rules from the PAE and applies them to incoming communication requests.
*   **Features:**
    *   Prioritizes dynamic rules over static policies in case of conflict.
    *   Provides a mechanism for administrators to override dynamic rules if necessary.
    *   Logs all dynamic rule changes and the rationale behind them for auditing purposes.

**4. Communication Flow Monitor (CFM):**

*   **Function:** Tracks the actual paths taken by communication flows through the network.  Uses techniques like sFlow or NetFlow to collect flow data.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Provides feedback to the PAE on the accuracy of its predictions.  This allows the PAE to refine its models and improve its performance over time.

**Pseudocode (PAE - core prediction logic):**

```
function predict_network_change(topology_history, current_topology, communication_flows):
  // 1. Analyze topology history for patterns (e.g., recurring failures, congestion)
  patterns = analyze_topology_history(topology_history)

  // 2. Identify potential disruptions based on patterns and current topology
  potential_disruptions = identify_disruptions(patterns, current_topology)

  // 3. Simulate impact of disruptions on communication flows
  simulated_flows = simulate_flows(potential_disruptions, communication_flows)

  // 4. Adjust authorization rules based on simulated flows
  dynamic_rules = generate_dynamic_rules(simulated_flows)

  return dynamic_rules
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   NTSM requires dedicated network interfaces for active probing.
*   PAE requires significant processing power for machine learning.  GPU acceleration is recommended.
*   High-bandwidth network connections for collecting flow data.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Protect NTSM from tampering.  Compromised NTSM could provide false topology information.
*   Secure communication between NTSM, PAE, and APM.
*   Implement robust access control to prevent unauthorized modification of authorization policies.
