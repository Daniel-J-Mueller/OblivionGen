## Dynamic Subsystem Composition via Predictive Modeling

**Specification:** A system extending automated infrastructure configuration to proactively suggest and implement subsystem compositions based on predicted application needs.

**Core Concept:** The current patent focuses on *reacting* to configuration requests and historical data. This expands that to *predict* likely needs based on observed patterns and suggest optimal subsystem arrangements *before* a formal request is made.

**Components:**

1.  **Predictive Modeling Engine:**  A machine learning model trained on historical configuration data, application performance metrics, user behavior, and external factors (e.g., time of day, geographic location, trending technologies).  This engine generates probabilistic predictions about future infrastructure needs. 

2.  **Subsystem Catalog:** An exhaustive inventory of available subsystems (databases, web servers, caching layers, security components, etc.), each with associated performance characteristics, resource requirements, and cost profiles.

3.  **Composition Engine:** An algorithm that, given a prediction from the Predictive Modeling Engine, selects an optimal combination of subsystems from the Subsystem Catalog. Optimization criteria include: performance, cost, scalability, security, and compliance.

4.  **Staging Environment:** A sandboxed environment for testing proposed subsystem compositions before deploying them to production. 

5.  **Feedback Loop:**  Data collected from the staging environment and production deployments is fed back into the Predictive Modeling Engine to refine its accuracy.

**Workflow:**

1.  The Predictive Modeling Engine monitors system activity and external data sources.
2.  Based on its analysis, it predicts a potential need for increased or modified infrastructure.
3.  The Composition Engine searches the Subsystem Catalog for the best combination of subsystems to meet the predicted need.
4.  The proposed composition is deployed to the Staging Environment for testing.
5.  If the testing is successful, the composition is deployed to production.
6.  Data from the production deployment is fed back into the Predictive Modeling Engine, improving its future predictions.

**Pseudocode (Composition Engine):**

```
FUNCTION composeSubsystem(predictedLoad, userProfile, currentInfrastructure)

  candidateCompositions = []

  // Iterate through possible combinations of subsystems
  FOR each subsystem1 IN SubsystemCatalog
    FOR each subsystem2 IN SubsystemCatalog
      //... iterate through more subsystems as needed

        composition = [subsystem1, subsystem2, ...]

        //Estimate cost and performance of composition
        estimatedCost = calculateCost(composition)
        estimatedPerformance = calculatePerformance(composition, predictedLoad)

        //Apply constraints (budget, security, compliance)
        IF meetsConstraints(composition) THEN

          //Add to candidate list
          candidateCompositions.append({composition: composition, cost: estimatedCost, performance: estimatedPerformance})
        ENDIF
      ENDFOR
    ENDFOR

  //Sort candidates by performance/cost ratio
  sortedCandidates = sort(candidateCandidates, key=performanceCostRatio)

  //Select top N candidates
  topCandidates = sortedCandidates[:N]

  RETURN topCandidates
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION performanceCostRatio(candidate)
  RETURN candidate.performance / candidate.cost
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Subsystem:** {name, type, resourceRequirements, performanceCharacteristics, costPerUnit, dependencies}
*   **Configuration:** {subsystems, networkTopology, securityPolicies, deploymentInstructions}

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Integration with DevOps tools for automated deployment.
*   A/B testing of different subsystem compositions.
*   Dynamic scaling of subsystems based on real-time load.
*   Anomaly detection to identify potential infrastructure issues.
*   Self-healing capabilities to automatically recover from failures.
