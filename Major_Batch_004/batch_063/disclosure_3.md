**Volumetric Capture Stage with Dynamic Reflective Surface**

**Concept:** Expand upon the reflective background concept to create a truly volumetric capture stage, enabling capture of subjects from arbitrary viewpoints *after* the initial capture. This moves beyond static imagery/video into a light-field-esque space.

**Specifications:**

*   **Stage Dimensions:** 8ft x 8ft x 8ft. Minimalist construction - aluminum frame with tensioned fabric.
*   **Reflective Surface:** The rear and side walls are constructed of an array of individually addressable, high-reflectivity, micro-LED panels. Resolution: 1000x1000 panels, spacing 2cm. Each panel capable of displaying a static color *or* a dynamic light pattern. Controlled by a dedicated processing unit.
*   **Elevation Platform:** Circular platform, 4ft diameter, transparent acrylic top, 6 inches high. Embedded LED strip around perimeter.
*   **Capture System:**
    *   Multiple (minimum 8) high-resolution cameras (global shutter, > 100 megapixels) positioned around the stage at varying heights and angles. Cameras synchronized via PTP.
    *   Structured light projector – projecting a coded light pattern onto the subject and reflective surfaces.
    *   Polarization filters on all cameras and projector to minimize glare.
*   **Illumination:**
    *   Key light: Variable intensity, color temperature.
    *   Backlight: Array of independently controllable LEDs behind the reflective surface.
    *   Ring light: Around each camera lens.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Dedicated processing unit (GPU cluster).
    *   Real-time rendering engine.
    *   Software for calibration, data acquisition, and rendering.

**Operation:**

1.  **Calibration:** The system is calibrated using a known calibration object. This establishes the precise 3D coordinates of each camera, projector, and reflective panel.
2.  **Data Acquisition:** The subject is positioned on the platform. Multiple cameras capture synchronized images of the subject and the dynamic reflective surface. The structured light pattern aids in depth reconstruction.
3.  **Rendering:** Software reconstructs a 3D model of the subject *and* the dynamic environment. The reflective surfaces are modeled as light sources. 
4.  **Viewpoint Rendering:** The user can specify an arbitrary viewpoint. The software renders the scene from that viewpoint, simulating the light reflections and refractions.

**Dynamic Environment Functionality:**

*   **Virtual Lighting:** The dynamic reflective surface can simulate arbitrary lighting conditions.
*   **Virtual Backgrounds:** The surface can display virtual backgrounds that react to the subject's movements.
*   **Volumetric Effects:** The surface can create volumetric effects, such as fog or smoke.
*   **Perspective Correction:** Dynamic adjustment of reflection patterns to correct for perspective distortion.

**Pseudocode – Dynamic Reflection Pattern Generation:**

```
function generateReflectionPattern(viewpointX, viewpointY, viewpointZ, subjectPositionX, subjectPositionY, subjectPositionZ) {

  // Calculate vector from viewpoint to subject
  viewToSubject = (subjectPositionX - viewpointX, subjectPositionY - viewpointY, subjectPositionZ - viewpointZ)

  // Calculate normal vector of reflective surface at point of intersection
  normalVector = calculateNormal(viewToSubject)

  // Calculate reflection vector
  reflectionVector = reflect(viewToSubject, normalVector)

  // Calculate color and intensity of light source at intersection point
  lightColor = calculateLightColor(intersectionPoint)
  lightIntensity = calculateLightIntensity(intersectionPoint)

  // Assign color and intensity to corresponding LED panel
  setLEDPanelColor(panelID, lightColor)
  setLEDPanelIntensity(panelID, lightIntensity)
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Virtual production.
*   Telepresence.
*   Interactive entertainment.
*   Product visualization.
*   Medical imaging.
