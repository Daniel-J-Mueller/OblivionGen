## Dynamic Voxel Resolution with Predictive Collision Mapping

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** High-resolution depth sensor (LiDAR or structured light), high-performance GPU, CPU with multi-core processing capabilities, sufficient RAM for voxel map storage (scalable based on environment size).
*   **Software:** Real-time operating system, voxel map generation library, predictive modeling framework (machine learning based), path planning algorithm (e.g., A*, RRT*).

**Innovation Description:**

This system builds upon the voxel map collision detection concept by introducing *dynamic voxel resolution* and *predictive collision mapping*. Instead of uniform voxel size, resolution adapts based on proximity to the moving object and detected object density. Areas far from the path or with low object density use larger voxels for efficiency. As the object approaches potential obstacles, the voxel size dynamically *increases* in that localized region.

Additionally, this system incorporates a predictive model. Using historical data and sensor input, the model anticipates future object movements within the environment.  This allows "phantom" voxels to be generated representing *predicted* positions of dynamic objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles) *before* they physically occupy that space.  These predictive voxels are integrated into the collision map.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
environment_size = define environment dimensions
base_voxel_size = 10 cm  //initial voxel size

// Real-time loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Sensor Data Acquisition
    sensor_data = acquire_depth_data()

    // 2. Dynamic Voxel Resolution
    voxel_map = generate_voxel_map(sensor_data, base_voxel_size)
    for each voxel in voxel_map {
        distance = calculate_distance_to_path(voxel)
        object_density = calculate_local_object_density(voxel)

        if (distance < threshold_near) and (object_density > threshold_high) {
            voxel.size = min(max_voxel_size, voxel.size * resolution_increase_factor)
        } else {
            voxel.size = max(min_voxel_size, voxel.size * resolution_decrease_factor)
        }
    }

    // 3. Predictive Collision Mapping
    predicted_object_positions = predict_future_positions(sensor_data, historical_data)
    for each predicted_position in predicted_object_positions {
        create_phantom_voxel(predicted_position, predicted_position_confidence)
        add_phantom_voxel_to_map(phantom_voxel, voxel_map)
    }
    
    // 4. Path Planning & Collision Detection
    path = plan_path(start_position, end_position, voxel_map)

    if (path_collides_with_voxels(path, voxel_map)) {
        //Handle collision (re-planning, stopping)
    } else {
        //Move along path
    }
}
```

**Key Components:**

*   **Adaptive Resolution Algorithm:**  Determines appropriate voxel size based on distance to the path and local object density. Parameters (thresholds, factors) are configurable.
*   **Predictive Modeling Framework:**  Employs machine learning (e.g., Kalman filtering, recurrent neural networks) to forecast the movement of dynamic objects.
*   **Phantom Voxel Generation:** Creates temporary voxels representing predicted future object positions. These voxels have a “confidence” value indicating the likelihood of the prediction being accurate.
*   **Confidence-Weighted Collision Check:**  During collision detection, voxels with lower confidence values contribute less to the collision determination.
