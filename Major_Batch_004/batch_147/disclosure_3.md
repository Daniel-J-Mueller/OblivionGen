## Adaptive Acoustic Environment Mapping & Projection

**Concept:** Extend directional audio enhancement by dynamically creating and projecting a localized acoustic “bubble” around the user, adapting to the surrounding environment to optimize speech clarity and minimize distractions.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Microphone Array: High-density, spatially distributed array (minimum 16 microphones).  Emphasis on vertical plane coverage alongside horizontal.
    *   Speaker Array: Multi-directional speaker array (minimum 8 speakers) capable of precise beamforming and wavefront synthesis.
    *   Processing Unit: High-performance embedded system with dedicated DSP and AI acceleration hardware.
    *   IMU/Spatial Sensors: Integrated Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and potentially visual-spatial sensors (e.g., miniature cameras) to track head/body orientation and movement.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Real-time Acoustic Mapping:**
        *   Employ a combination of beamforming, sound source localization, and acoustic impulse response (AIR) measurement to construct a 3D map of the surrounding acoustic environment.  Map resolution: 5cm cubed minimum.
        *   Use machine learning (specifically, Gaussian Process Regression) to predict AIRs in unmeasured areas, filling in gaps and creating a continuous map.
        *   Dynamic map updating at a rate of 10 Hz minimum.
    *   **Acoustic Bubble Generation:**
        *   Based on the acoustic map, define a localized “bubble” around the user’s head. This bubble will be the target area for acoustic enhancement. Bubble size dynamically adjustable (0.5m - 2m radius).
        *   Employ wavefront synthesis techniques to create “anti-noise” signals that cancel out external distractions *within* the bubble.  Target frequencies: 300Hz - 3kHz.
        *   Simultaneously, generate “focused enhancement” signals for desired sound sources (e.g., the person speaking to the user).  These signals will amplify the desired sound and direct it towards the user’s ears.
    *   **Adaptive Beamforming & Filtering:**
        *   Employ a multi-channel adaptive beamformer (similar to those in the provided patent but significantly more advanced) to shape the acoustic signals and direct them within the bubble.
        *   Implement advanced noise reduction algorithms (e.g., spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering) to further minimize distractions.
        *   Dynamically adjust beamforming weights and filter parameters based on the acoustic map and user preferences.
    *   **User Interface:**
        *   Companion app for customizing acoustic bubble size, noise cancellation level, and sound enhancement profiles.
        *   Real-time visualization of the acoustic map and bubble shape.
        *   Option to manually override automatic adjustments.

**Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
loop:
    // 1. Capture Audio & Sensor Data
    audio_data = capture_audio(microphone_array)
    sensor_data = capture_sensor_data(IMU, spatial_sensors)

    // 2. Acoustic Map Update
    acoustic_map = update_acoustic_map(audio_data, sensor_data)

    // 3. Bubble Generation & Signal Processing
    bubble_shape = define_bubble_shape(acoustic_map, user_preferences)
    desired_signal = extract_desired_signal(acoustic_map) //E.g. person speaking
    noise_signal = identify_noise_signals(acoustic_map)
    anti_noise_signal = generate_anti_noise_signal(noise_signal)
    enhanced_signal = synthesize_enhanced_signal(desired_signal, anti_noise_signal)

    // 4. Beamforming & Audio Output
    beamforming_weights = calculate_beamforming_weights(bubble_shape, enhanced_signal)
    output_signal = apply_beamforming(beamforming_weights, enhanced_signal)
    output_audio(speaker_array, output_signal)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Improved communication in noisy environments (e.g., open offices, crowded streets).
*   Enhanced virtual/augmented reality experiences.
*   Personalized audio spaces for focus and relaxation.
*   Assistive listening devices for individuals with hearing impairments.
