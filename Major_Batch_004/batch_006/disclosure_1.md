## Adaptive Multi-Spectral Baseline Generation for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend motion extraction beyond visible light by incorporating multi-spectral imaging (infrared, UV, etc.). Create a dynamic baseline image not just from visible light frames, but a composite baseline built from optimal exposures *across all captured spectra* at each time step. This allows for robust motion extraction in conditions where visible light is insufficient or misleading (e.g., smoke, darkness, camouflage).

**Specifications:**

1.  **Sensor Suite:** Imaging system incorporates at least three distinct spectral bands (Visible, Near-Infrared, Shortwave Infrared). Expandability to additional bands is required. Each band utilizes a rolling shutter or global shutter sensor with adjustable exposure time.

2.  **Exposure Optimization Algorithm:**  For each spectral band *at each time step*, determine the optimal exposure time to maximize signal-to-noise ratio *while avoiding saturation*. Algorithm should consider:
    *   Real-time histogram analysis of incoming data.
    *   Automatic gain control (AGC) per band.
    *   Adaptive exposure bracketing and selection based on scene dynamics.

3.  **Multi-Spectral Baseline Construction:**
    *   At each time step, combine the optimally exposed images from each spectral band into a single “baseline image”. This could be a simple weighted average or a more complex fusion using image pyramids or wavelets.
    *   Store baseline images as a sequence representing the static scene background.

4.  **Motion Extraction Algorithm:**
    *   Compare current frame (from all spectral bands) with the corresponding baseline image (all spectral bands).
    *   Calculate a “motion score” per pixel based on the differences across *all* spectral bands. This score should be a weighted sum of the differences in each band (weights adjustable).
    *   Apply a threshold to the motion score to identify moving objects.
    *   Utilize a connected component labeling algorithm to group neighboring pixels into moving object segments.

5.  **Dynamic Baseline Update:**  Implement a mechanism to dynamically update the baseline image over time. This could involve:
    *   A moving average filter to gradually incorporate changes in the static scene.
    *   An anomaly detection algorithm to identify and mask transient events that could corrupt the baseline.

6.  **Pseudocode (Motion Extraction):**

    ```
    FOR each spectral_band in [Visible, NIR, SWIR]:
        FOR each pixel (x, y) in frame[spectral_band]:
            difference = abs(frame[spectral_band][x, y] - baseline[spectral_band][x, y])
            motion_score[x, y] += difference * weight[spectral_band]

    threshold = adaptive_threshold(motion_score)

    FOR each pixel (x, y) in motion_score:
        IF motion_score[x, y] > threshold:
            mark pixel as moving
        ELSE:
            mark pixel as static
    ```

7.  **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Multi-spectral camera system (at least three bands).
    *   High-performance image processing unit (GPU or dedicated processor).
    *   Sufficient memory to store baseline images and intermediate data.

8. **Potential Applications:**
    * Surveillance and security systems (robust performance in low-light conditions).
    * Autonomous navigation (accurate obstacle detection).
    * Industrial inspection (defect detection in challenging environments).
    * Search and rescue operations (detection of people in smoke or darkness).
