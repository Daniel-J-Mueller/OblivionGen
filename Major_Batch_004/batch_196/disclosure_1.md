**Dynamic Interest Graph Propagation for Proactive Community Formation**

**Concept:** Extend the event data analysis to not just *identify* existing community affinities, but to *proactively* foster new, potentially latent communities by propagating interest signals across the user network. This goes beyond suggesting existing communities; it *builds* them.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Interest Graph Construction:**
    *   Represent each user as a node in a graph.
    *   Edges represent inferred interest similarity based on event data (purchases, views, searches, etc.). Edge weight = strength of similarity.
    *   Initial graph constructed from all users & event data.

2.  **Interest Propagation Algorithm:**
    *   **Seed Selection:** Identify "seed" users – those with strong, unique interest profiles (high degree centrality, low overlap with existing communities).
    *   **Propagation Rounds:**
        *   For each seed user, activate their primary interests.
        *   Propagate these interests to neighboring users based on edge weights.
        *   Each receiving user adds the propagated interest to their profile, weighted by the propagation strength.
        *   Repeat for multiple rounds.  Dampening factor to prevent runaway propagation.
    *   **Community Detection:** After propagation, apply a community detection algorithm (e.g., Louvain, Leiden) to identify emergent clusters – these are potential new communities.

3.  **Community "Nurturing":**
    *   **Initial Group Formation:** Automatically create a temporary "nurturing" group for each emergent community.
    *   **Content Seed:** Seed the group with relevant content based on the community's dominant interests.
    *   **Activity Monitoring:** Track engagement within the group (posts, likes, shares).
    *   **Persistence Threshold:** If the group reaches a certain engagement threshold within a defined timeframe, it becomes a permanent community. Otherwise, the group dissolves, and users are removed from the temporary cluster.

4.  **Dynamic Weighting & Feature Integration:**
    *   **Temporal Decay:**  Older event data contributes less to similarity calculations.
    *   **Event Type Weighting:** Different event types (purchases vs. views) have different weights.
    *   **Contextual Features:** Integrate external data (location, demographics) to refine similarity calculations.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Data Structures
Graph UserGraph;
User[] Users;
Event[] Events;
Community[] Communities;

// Function: Build User Graph
function BuildUserGraph(Users, Events) {
  // For each user, create a node in the graph
  // Calculate similarity between users based on event data
  // Create edges between users with significant similarity
  // Assign edge weights based on similarity strength
  return UserGraph;
}

// Function: Propagate Interests
function PropagateInterests(UserGraph, seedUser, propagationRounds, dampeningFactor) {
  // Activate seedUser's interests
  // For each propagation round:
  //   For each neighbor of activated nodes:
  //     Add interests to neighbor’s profile, weighted by edge weight and dampening factor
  // Return updated UserGraph
}

// Function: Detect Communities
function DetectCommunities(UserGraph) {
  // Apply community detection algorithm (e.g., Louvain, Leiden)
  // Return list of communities
}

// Function: Nurture Community
function NurtureCommunity(Community) {
  // Create temporary nurturing group
  // Seed group with relevant content
  // Monitor engagement
  // If engagement exceeds threshold, make community permanent
  // Otherwise, dissolve group
}

// Main Program
UserGraph = BuildUserGraph(Users, Events);

for each User in Users:
  if User is a seed User:
    PropagateInterests(UserGraph, User, propagationRounds, dampeningFactor);

Communities = DetectCommunities(UserGraph);

for each Community in Communities:
  NurtureCommunity(Community);
```

**Potential Innovations:**

*   **Proactive community formation** instead of passive recommendation.
*   **Dynamic weighting** of event data and features.
*   **Adaptive propagation** algorithm.
*   **Automated community nurturing** process.
