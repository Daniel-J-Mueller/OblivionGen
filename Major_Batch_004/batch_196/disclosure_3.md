**Dynamic Attribute-Driven Product Morphing**

**Concept:** Extend the existing product selection/filtering system by allowing users to *morph* product attributes in real-time within the display window, visualizing the impact on available results. This moves beyond simple filtering to interactive product design/customization *before* selection.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Attribute Identification & Mapping:**
    *   System analyzes product data to identify key morphable attributes (e.g., shoe heel height, handbag strap length, shirt sleeve length, jacket color, etc.).
    *   Each attribute is mapped to a visual control element within the display window (slider, color picker, dropdown, numerical input).
    *   Attribute ranges are dynamically determined based on available product data.

2.  **Real-Time Morphing Interface:**
    *   A dedicated “Morph” panel is displayed alongside the product grid.
    *   Each attribute control updates the product grid *instantaneously* as the user interacts with it.  No "Apply" button – changes are live.
    *   The system employs a predictive algorithm. As a user adjusts an attribute, the system *estimates* the number of matching products *before* the adjustment is fully completed, displaying a ‘Products Found: X’ counter above the grid.
    *   Morphable attributes are visually highlighted on the displayed product images (e.g., a glowing outline around the heel of a shoe if heel height is being adjusted).

3.  **Morphing Algorithm:**
    *   The core algorithm is an iterative refinement process.
    *   `Initial_Product_Set = All_Products`
    *   `For Each Morphable_Attribute in User_Adjustments:`
        *   `Filtered_Product_Set = Filter(Filtered_Product_Set, Attribute >= User_Minimum and Attribute <= User_Maximum)`
    *   `Display(Filtered_Product_Set)`

4.  **Visual Feedback & Error Handling:**
    *   If a morph adjustment results in zero matching products, the system provides gentle visual feedback (e.g., a dimmed product grid, a “No Results” message) *and* suggests the nearest valid parameter range.
    *   An 'Undo' button is available to revert to the last morph adjustment.

5.  **Product Representation:**
    *   The system can dynamically generate simplified product representations on the fly to demonstrate the morphed attributes.  For example, if morphing a handbag strap length, the display could show a wireframe representation of the bag with the adjusted strap.
    *   High-resolution product images are loaded only for products within the currently filtered set.

6. **Integration with Existing Search:**
    *   Users can combine Morphing with existing keyword or category search. Morphing *refines* a pre-filtered set of products.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function updateProductGrid(morphSettings):
  filteredProducts = allProducts
  for attribute in morphSettings:
    minVal = morphSettings[attribute]['min']
    maxVal = morphSettings[attribute]['max']
    filteredProducts = filter(filteredProducts, product[attribute] >= minVal and product[attribute] <= maxVal)

  display(filteredProducts)

function handleAttributeChange(attribute, value):
  morphSettings[attribute] = value
  updateProductGrid(morphSettings)
```
