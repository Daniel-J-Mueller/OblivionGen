## Dynamic Object Reconstruction & Predictive Capture

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond 2D image matching by creating a dynamic 3D reconstruction of the object *during* the capture process, informed by user movement and allowing for predictive capture of obscured features. This moves beyond guiding orientation to *building* an object model in real-time.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Device with depth sensor (LiDAR, structured light, or stereo vision) *in addition* to RGB camera.  IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for accurate motion tracking. Processing unit capable of real-time point cloud processing and mesh generation.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Real-time SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):**  Fused depth & RGB data.  Initial coarse 3D model built *immediately* upon initiating capture.  This is not static; it dynamically updates with every frame.
    *   **Predictive Occlusion Handling:**  Algorithm analyzes user movement and object geometry. When a portion of the object is obscured by the device or the user’s hand, the algorithm *predicts* the geometry of the hidden surface based on the existing 3D model and the trajectory of the device. This generates a ‘ghosted’ visual representation of the hidden geometry displayed to the user.
    *   **Guided Capture Overlay:** The display shows the live video feed *with* the dynamically generated 3D model overlaid.  Key features are highlighted, and the system guides the user to pan, tilt, or rotate the device to reveal obscured portions (similar to the existing guide, but now reacting to the evolving model).
    *   **Data Fusion & Mesh Optimization:**  Data from multiple passes (user panning/rotating) is fused to create a complete, optimized 3D mesh.  This mesh is used for matching against the object database.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** Device accesses contextual information (GPS, time of day, user history) to refine the object category prediction and improve matching accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Capture Loop):**

```
Initialize SLAM;
Start Video Feed;
Initial Object Category Prediction (based on contextual data);
Display Initial Object Category & Guided Capture Overlay;

While (Capture Not Complete):
    Frame = Capture Video Frame;
    DepthMap = Capture Depth Data;
    SLAM.Update(Frame, DepthMap); //Refine 3D model
    HiddenGeometry = PredictHiddenGeometry(SLAM.Model, DeviceMotion);
    Display(Frame, SLAM.Model, HiddenGeometry); //Overlaid Visualization

    If (SLAM.Model.Completeness > Threshold):
        Capture Complete = True;

        FinalMesh = OptimizeMesh(SLAM.Model);
        MatchingResults = FindBestMatch(FinalMesh, ObjectDatabase);
        Display(MatchingResults);
    Else:
        GuideUser(MissingDataRegions); //Highlight areas needing capture
```

**Novelty:** This system actively *reconstructs* the object during capture, predicting obscured geometry and guiding the user to fill in the missing data. It shifts the focus from static orientation guides to a dynamic 3D reconstruction process, ultimately leading to more robust and accurate object identification. This is superior to simply matching 2D images.
