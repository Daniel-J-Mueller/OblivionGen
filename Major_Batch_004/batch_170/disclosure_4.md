## Electronic Device - Haptic Feedback Projection

**Concept:** An electronic device incorporating localized haptic feedback *projection*. Instead of relying on vibrating the device itself, or surface-level textures, this system projects focused ultrasonic waves to create the *sensation* of texture and form directly onto the user’s hand or other body part, *without* physical contact.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Technology:** Phased array of micro-ultrasonic transducers. Minimum 64 transducers, optimally 256+, arranged in a 2D grid (e.g., 16x16).  Frequency range: 20kHz - 80kHz.
*   **Control System:** Dedicated FPGA or high-performance microcontroller to manage phased array signal generation and beamforming. Real-time processing capability critical.
*   **Power Supply:** 5V DC, 2A minimum. Dedicated power regulation for each transducer array section to ensure consistent output.
*   **Sensing:**  Integrated proximity sensor (ToF or infrared) to detect hand position and orientation relative to the device. Range: 5mm - 100mm. Resolution: 1mm.
*   **Software Interface:**  API for developers to define haptic “textures” and “shapes” as data arrays.  Parameters: Amplitude, Frequency, Phase, Beamforming coefficients.
*   **Material:** Device casing - lightweight polymer (ABS or polycarbonate). Transducer array substrate - FR4 or similar PCB material.
*   **Dimensions:** Target size – roughly equivalent to a smartphone.  Flexible form factor desirable (bendable OLED screen combined with flexible PCB for transducers).
*   **Haptic Resolution:** Target resolution – ability to create distinct haptic features down to 1mm in size.
*   **Safety Features:** Automatic power shutoff if proximity sensor detects object closer than 5mm (to prevent unintended sensation). Software limits on ultrasonic power output to comply with safety standards.

**Operation:**

1.  Proximity sensor detects user’s hand position.
2.  Control system calculates optimal phased array parameters based on desired haptic effect and hand position.
3.  Phased array generates focused ultrasonic waves that create localized pressure variations on the user’s skin. These variations are interpreted by the brain as tactile sensation.
4.  Software interface allows for dynamic adjustment of haptic parameters, enabling complex and realistic tactile experiences.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Texture Generation):**

```
function generateHapticTexture(textureMap, handPosition) {
  for each pixel in textureMap {
    x = pixel.x
    y = pixel.y
    intensity = pixel.intensity // 0-255
    
    // Calculate ultrasonic wave parameters based on pixel intensity
    amplitude = map(intensity, 0, 255, 0, maxAmplitude)
    frequency = baseFrequency + (intensity * frequencyOffset)
    phase = (x + y) * phaseMultiplier
    
    // Calculate beamforming coefficients for each transducer
    coefficients = calculateBeamformingCoefficients(x, y, amplitude, frequency, phase, transducerArrayGeometry, handPosition)
    
    // Apply coefficients to each transducer
    for each transducer in transducerArray {
      transducer.amplitude = coefficients[transducer.index]
    }
  }
  
  // Send signal to transducers
}

function calculateBeamformingCoefficients(x, y, amplitude, frequency, phase, arrayGeometry, handPosition) {
  // This function calculates the weights for each transducer
  // based on the desired focal point (x, y) and the geometry of the array.
  // It uses constructive and destructive interference to focus the sound waves.
  // ArrayGeometry contains the physical locations of the transducers.
  // handPosition is used to compensate for distance and angle.
  // Implementation details will vary depending on the chosen beamforming algorithm.

  //Return array of coefficients
}
