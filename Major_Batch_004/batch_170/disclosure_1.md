**Adaptive Facility Configuration via Predicted Group Dynamics**

**System Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution multi-spectral cameras (visible, thermal, potentially terahertz) at all facility entry/exit points (parking, building entrances, loading docks).
    *   Bluetooth/UWB beacon network throughout the facility.
    *   Weight sensors in parking spaces (optional, for vehicle occupancy estimation).
    *   Microphone array at entry points (for ambient sound analysis - group size estimation).
*   **Processing Unit:** Edge computing devices at each sensor cluster + centralized high-performance server cluster.
*   **Data Storage:** Time-series database for sensor data, relational database for association data, graph database for group dynamic modelling.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Vehicle/User Detection & Tracking:** Deep learning models for object detection, pose estimation, and re-identification.
    *   **Association Data Manager:** Stores and manages the association between vehicles, users, and groups.
    *   **Group Dynamics Modeller:** A graph-based AI that predicts group behavior (split-ups, merges, destinations within the facility).  Uses reinforcement learning trained on historical data.
    *   **Adaptive Configuration Engine:** Orchestrates facility changes (lighting, HVAC, security settings, inventory staging) based on predictions.
    *   **User Interface:** Real-time visualization of group movements, predicted destinations, and facility configurations.

**Innovation Description:**

The system moves beyond simple user identification to *predict* how groups will behave *within* the facility.  Instead of reacting to user presence, it proactively configures the environment to optimize their experience.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
Load Historical Data (vehicle/user associations, facility usage patterns)
Initialize Group Dynamics Model (Graph Database)

//Real-time Operation
ON Vehicle Detected:
    Vehicle ID = DetectVehicle(Camera Feed)
    User Candidate Set = QueryAssociationData(Vehicle ID)
    User List = DetectUsers(Camera Feed)
    Filter User List based on User Candidate Set
    
    //Group Formation & Prediction
    Group = FormGroup(User List)  //Determine group membership
    PredictedPath = PredictGroupPath(Group, Facility Map, Historical Data) //Using Group Dynamics Model
    
    //Adaptive Configuration
    ConfigureFacility(PredictedPath) //Lighting, HVAC, Security, Inventory Staging
    
ON User Movement Detected (Bluetooth/UWB Beacons):
    Update User Location on Facility Map
    Refine PredictedPath based on Real-time Movement
    Adjust Facility Configuration accordingly
    
ON Group Split Detected:
    Create Sub-Groups
    Predict Paths for Each Sub-Group
    Configure Facility for Each Sub-Group

//Background Processing
Periodically Retrain Group Dynamics Model with New Data
```

**Detailed Functionality:**

1.  **Group Formation:**  The system attempts to identify if detected users belong to a pre-existing group. This uses historical association data but also considers proximity, travel patterns, and potentially even audio cues (detecting conversations).
2.  **Path Prediction:**  A graph database stores the facility layout as nodes and common travel paths as edges. The Group Dynamics Model (a reinforcement learning agent) learns to predict the most likely path a group will take based on their identity, time of day, historical data, and current location.
3.  **Adaptive Configuration:** Based on the predicted path, the system adjusts:
    *   **Lighting/HVAC:** Pre-cool or heat areas the group is likely to visit. Adjust lighting levels.
    *   **Security:** Open/close access control points along the predicted path.
    *   **Inventory Staging:** If the group is associated with a pick list, stage the necessary items closer to their predicted location.
    *    **Digital Signage:** Display relevant information (directions, promotions) based on group identity/preferences.

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond passive user identification to *proactive* facility management. It leverages AI to predict group dynamics and optimize the environment *before* the group arrives at a particular location.  This allows for a more seamless and personalized experience for users and improves overall facility efficiency.
