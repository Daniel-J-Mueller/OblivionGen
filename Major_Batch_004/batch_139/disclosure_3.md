## Adaptive Resource Allocation via Predictive Failure Analysis

**Specification:**

**System Name:** Phoenix

**Core Concept:** Proactively allocate resources in a secondary cloud environment *before* a failure is detected, based on predictive failure analysis and application dependency mapping. This differs from the provided patent's reactive reconstruction by anticipating needs and pre-warming the environment.

**Components:**

1.  **Telemetry Collector:** Continuously gathers performance metrics (CPU, memory, I/O, network latency, error rates) from all components of the primary CBCE.  This collector isn't just looking for *current* failures; it's building a historical baseline.
2.  **Predictive Failure Engine:** A machine learning model trained on the historical telemetry data. This engine identifies anomalies and predicts potential component failures *before* they occur. Models should include time-series forecasting (e.g., LSTM networks) and anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., isolation forests). Confidence intervals for predictions are crucial.
3.  **Dependency Mapper:**  Dynamically maps the dependencies between all components of the primary CBCE.  This isn’t static configuration; it’s an active discovery process.  Utilizes tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) to understand communication flows.
4.  **Resource Allocator:**  When the Predictive Failure Engine flags a component with a high probability of failure (above a configurable threshold), the Resource Allocator proactively allocates resources in the secondary cloud environment to replicate that component and its dependencies. Resource allocation considers performance characteristics, cost, and availability.
5.  **State Transfer Engine:**  Facilitates the transfer of application state from the potentially failing component in the primary environment to the replicated component in the secondary environment. Supports multiple state transfer methods (e.g., snapshot, incremental replication).
6.  **Traffic Switcher:**  Upon confirmed failure (or pre-emptive switch if confidence is extremely high), seamlessly redirects traffic from the failed component to the pre-provisioned and state-synchronized component in the secondary environment.
7.  **Dynamic Scaling Engine:** Continuously monitors the performance of the reconstructed CBCE and automatically scales resources up or down based on demand. 

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocator):**

```
function allocateResources(component, predictedFailureProbability, dependencyMap) {
  if (predictedFailureProbability > config.threshold) {
    requiredResources = getResourceRequirements(component, dependencyMap);
    allocatedResources = provisionResources(requiredResources, secondaryCloudEnvironment);
    
    if (allocatedResources != null) {
        stateTransferEngine.transferState(component, allocatedResources);
        trafficSwitcher.registerComponent(allocatedResources, component);
        log("Resources allocated for " + component + " in secondary environment");
    } else {
        log("Failed to allocate resources for " + component);
    }
  }
}

function getResourceRequirements(component, dependencyMap) {
  // Determine CPU, memory, storage, network bandwidth, etc.
  // based on component's historical usage and dependency analysis.
  // Consider scaling factors for anticipated load.
  ...
  return resourceRequirements;
}

function provisionResources(resourceRequirements, secondaryCloudEnvironment) {
  // Use cloud provider APIs to provision resources.
  // Handle resource allocation failures gracefully.
  ...
  return allocatedResources;
}
```

**Novelty:**

This system shifts from *reacting* to failures to *anticipating* them and pre-provisioning resources. The proactive approach minimizes downtime and improves application resilience. The dependency mapping and state transfer engines ensure a seamless failover experience.  The reliance on machine learning for predictive analysis is a key differentiator. The dynamic scaling allows for cost optimization and ensures the reconstructed CBCE can handle varying workloads.
