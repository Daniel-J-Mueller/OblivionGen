## Adaptive Resource Prefetching based on Predicted User Attention

**Specification:** Implement a system that preemptively fetches resources *not directly requested* but predicted to be viewed by the user based on real-time attention tracking. This extends beyond simple link prediction and incorporates visual attention analysis.

**Components:**

1.  **Attention Tracking Module:**
    *   **Input:** Live video feed of user's screen (with permission), mouse movements, keyboard inputs.
    *   **Processing:** Employ computer vision models (e.g., saliency maps, gaze estimation) to determine the user’s focal point on the screen. Also track mouse movements and keyboard input to indicate areas of interest.
    *   **Output:** A time-series of “attention scores” for different screen regions.

2.  **Content Analysis Module:**
    *   **Input:** Current web page HTML/CSS/JS.
    *   **Processing:** Parse the page structure to identify all potentially loadable resources (images, videos, scripts, iframes, etc.).  Determine the visual boundaries of each resource on the screen.
    *   **Output:** A list of all loadable resources with their screen coordinates.

3.  **Prediction Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Attention scores, list of loadable resources, historical user browsing data.
    *   **Processing:** Use a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, transformer) trained to predict which resources the user will likely view *next* based on current attention and past behavior.  Consider factors like:
        *   Proximity of resources to the current focal point.
        *   Direction of gaze movement.
        *   Scrolling speed and direction.
        *   Past interactions with similar resources.
    *   **Output:** A ranked list of predicted resources to prefetch, along with a “confidence score” for each prediction.

4.  **Prefetching Module:**
    *   **Input:** Ranked list of predicted resources, confidence scores.
    *   **Processing:** Initiate requests for the top-ranked resources, subject to a configurable threshold for confidence scores and a limit on concurrent requests. Utilize HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 for efficient multiplexing. Implement a caching strategy to avoid redundant fetches.
    *   **Output:** Prefetched resources are stored in the browser cache.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop (executed periodically, e.g., every 100ms)
function mainLoop() {
  attentionData = trackAttention();  // Get current attention scores
  resourceList = analyzeContent(); // Get list of resources on page

  predictedResources = predictNextResources(attentionData, resourceList); // ML Model

  for (resource in predictedResources) {
    if (resource.confidence > threshold) {
      prefetchResource(resource.url);
    }
  }

  setTimeout(mainLoop, 100);
}

function trackAttention() {
  // Implement computer vision logic to determine attention scores
  // Returns: {x, y, score} for different regions of the screen
}

function analyzeContent() {
  // Parse the HTML and CSS to identify all loadable resources
  // Returns: List of resources with their coordinates on the screen
}

function predictNextResources(attentionData, resourceList) {
  // Use a trained ML model to predict the next resources the user will view
  // Returns: List of predicted resources with their confidence scores
}

function prefetchResource(url) {
  // Initiate a request to fetch the resource and store it in the cache
}
```

**Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:** Obtaining user attention data requires explicit permission and careful handling to protect privacy.
*   **Battery Life:** Continuous attention tracking can be resource-intensive. Optimize the algorithm to minimize battery drain.
*   **Network Bandwidth:** Prefetching resources consumes bandwidth. Implement throttling and prioritize resources based on confidence scores.
*   **False Positives:**  Inaccurate predictions can lead to wasted bandwidth and unnecessary processing. Fine-tune the ML model to minimize false positives.
