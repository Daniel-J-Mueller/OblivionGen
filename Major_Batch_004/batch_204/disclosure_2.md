## Dynamic Schema Shifting with AI-Driven Content Re-Assembly

**Concept:** Extend obfuscation beyond simple element replacement to full schema modification coupled with AI-driven content re-assembly, creating a constantly evolving webpage structure for automated agents while maintaining human readability.

**Specs:**

**1. Schema Repository:**

*   A database containing multiple webpage schemas (HTML structures) for a given content type (e.g., product page, article). These schemas differ in element types, nesting, and attribute names.  Each schema is assigned a 'complexity' score based on deviation from a standard schema.
*   Schema generation module:  AI model trained to generate new, valid webpage schemas based on existing schemas and defined constraints (e.g., maintain accessibility, support specific content types).  Model accepts parameters defining the desired level of complexity and content type.
*   Schema versioning: Each schema is tagged with a version number and metadata (creation date, complexity score, associated content type).

**2. Content Decomposition & Tagging:**

*   Incoming content (text, images, data) is parsed and tagged with semantic labels identifying its meaning (e.g., "product name", "price", "image", "description"). A robust Named Entity Recognition (NER) model is crucial.
*   A 'content graph' is created representing the relationships between content elements.  This graph is independent of any specific webpage schema.

**3. Dynamic Schema Selection & Application:**

*   Upon request, a ‘Schema Selector’ module determines the appropriate schema. This selection considers:
    *   **Agent Identification:** Attempts to identify the requesting agent (human, bot, known scraper).
    *   **Traffic Patterns:** Monitors traffic volume and frequency.
    *   **Randomness:** Introduces controlled randomness to schema selection.
    *   **Complexity Adjustment:** Dynamically adjusts schema complexity based on detected scraping attempts (higher complexity for suspected scrapers).
*   The selected schema is applied to the content graph, transforming the content into a structured HTML document.

**4. AI-Driven Content Re-Assembly:**

*   An AI model (e.g., a transformer network) is trained to map semantic content labels to schema elements. This model is responsible for:
    *   **Element Mapping:**  Deciding which schema elements are best suited to display each content label.
    *   **Attribute Assignment:**  Assigning appropriate attributes to schema elements based on content and schema context.
    *   **Styling Adaptation:** Adjusting CSS styles to ensure content is displayed correctly within the selected schema.
*   The re-assembly process ensures the visual appearance of the content remains consistent for human users, even with schema changes.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function handleRequest(request) {
  agent = identifyAgent(request);
  traffic = monitorTraffic();
  schema = selectSchema(agent, traffic);
  contentGraph = decomposeContent(request.content);
  reconfiguredContent = assembleContent(contentGraph, schema);
  return reconfiguredContent;
}

function selectSchema(agent, traffic) {
  randomValue = generateRandomValue();
  if (agent == "scraper" || traffic > threshold) {
    complexity = high;
  } else {
    complexity = low;
  }
  schema = getSchema(complexity, request.contentType);
  return schema;
}

function assembleContent(contentGraph, schema) {
  //AI model maps content graph nodes to schema elements
  reconfiguredContent = AIModel.mapContentToSchema(contentGraph, schema);
  return reconfiguredContent;
}
```

**Considerations:**

*   Requires significant computational resources for schema generation and content re-assembly.
*   AI model must be carefully trained to ensure content accuracy and visual consistency.
*   Potential impact on SEO – careful consideration must be given to maintaining crawlability and indexability.
*   The schema generation module and content re-assembly model should be decoupled and modular for easy updates and experimentation.
