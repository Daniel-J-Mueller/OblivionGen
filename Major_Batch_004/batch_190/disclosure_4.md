## Self-Sealing Microfluidic Network with Dynamic Topology

**Concept:** A flexible tube system incorporating microfluidic channels *within* the tube wall, coupled with localized expansion/contraction sensing, to create a self-sealing, dynamically reconfigurable fluid network.  This goes beyond leak detection to actively *repair* minor breaches and reroute flow.

**Specifications:**

*   **Tube Material:**  Elastomeric polymer composite containing dispersed microfluidic channels (approx. 50-200um diameter). The composite should exhibit high elasticity and resistance to common fluids.  Embedded within the material is a network of shape-memory alloy (SMA) micro-actuators.
*   **Sensing Integration:** Existing pressure sensing technology (like the patent's) is retained but augmented.  In addition to expansion/contraction, incorporate *electrical impedance tomography (EIT)* sensors distributed along the tube length, embedded within the elastomeric matrix.  EIT will provide a cross-sectional “image” of fluid flow and detect subtle changes indicating blockages or breaches *within* the tube wall itself.
*   **Microfluidic Channel Network:**  The internal microfluidic channels are filled with a self-sealing polymer sealant (e.g., cyanoacrylate-based, with controlled viscosity). These channels intersect the main fluid path at regular intervals, and are normally sealed off.  
*   **Actuation & Sealant Deployment:**  When a breach or blockage is detected (by combined pressure and EIT data), the local SMA actuators are energized. This serves two purposes:
    1.  Local contraction of the tube wall, increasing pressure at the breach and forcing sealant into the damaged area.
    2.  Controlled opening of microfluidic channels *adjacent* to the breach, releasing sealant directly into the damaged region.
*   **Dynamic Topology Control:**  The system includes multiple parallel tube sections and manifold junctions. The control system (computing device) can dynamically adjust fluid flow by selectively activating/deactivating sections and rerouting flow through alternative pathways based on detected failures or blockages.
*   **Control System Logic (Pseudocode):**

```pseudocode
// Data Acquisition
pressureData = readPressureSensors()
eitData = readEITSensors()
flowRateData = readFlowRateSensors()

// Anomaly Detection
breachDetected = detectBreach(pressureData, eitData)
blockageDetected = detectBlockage(flowRateData, pressureData)

// Mitigation Strategy
if breachDetected:
    localizeBreach(pressureData, eitData)
    activateSMA(breachLocation)   // Contract tube & open sealant channels
    monitorSealantEffectiveness(pressureData, eitData)
    adjustFlowRate(breachLocation)
if blockageDetected:
    isolateBlockedSection()
    rerouteFlow()
    alertOperator()
```

*   **Redundancy:**  Multiple sensing devices and parallel flow paths are incorporated to provide fault tolerance and system resilience.
*   **Scalability:**  The system is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for the creation of complex fluid networks with varying capacities and configurations.
