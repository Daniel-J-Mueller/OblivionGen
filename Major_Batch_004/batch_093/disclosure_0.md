## Adaptive Biometric Projection System

**Concept:** A user recognition device that projects a customizable, dynamic biometric “mask” onto the user’s face, visible only to the device’s sensors. This replaces static facial recognition with a constantly shifting, personalized biometric signature.

**Specs:**

*   **Projection System:** Miniature, low-power pico-projector integrated into the device housing (potentially a headset, glasses frame, or dedicated stand). Resolution: 640x480 minimum. Projection wavelength: Near-infrared (NIR) for invisibility to the naked eye, but optimal sensor capture.  Projector must have dynamic focusing capabilities.
*   **Biometric Mask Generation:**
    *   **Data Input:** Initial biometric scan (facial features, iris pattern, thermal signature) to establish a baseline.
    *   **Dynamic Algorithm:**  A procedural generation algorithm creates a constantly shifting “mask” based on the baseline biometric data *and* real-time user physiological data (heart rate variability via integrated sensor, micro-expression analysis via camera, subtle skin conductivity changes).
    *   **Mask Characteristics:** The mask is not a literal overlay, but a pattern of NIR light dots or lines that *modulate* the user’s facial features, creating a unique, shifting signature. Dot/line density and pattern complexity are adjustable.
    *   **Security Feature:** The algorithm includes a seeded random number generator controlled by a user-defined "dynamic key" (a changing password, or a biometric trigger like a blink pattern). This ensures mask generation isn’t predictable.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   **NIR Camera:** High-sensitivity NIR camera to capture the projected biometric mask.  Must be capable of accurate pattern recognition in varying lighting conditions.
    *   **Physiological Sensors:** Heart rate sensor, skin conductance sensor, micro-expression camera (visible light).
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated processing unit (SoC) to handle real-time mask generation, sensor data processing, and pattern recognition.
*   **Power:** Battery-powered, with a target operating time of 8+ hours.
*   **Housing:** Lightweight and ergonomic housing suitable for wearable or stationary use.

**Pseudocode (Mask Generation):**

```
function generate_mask(baseline_biometrics, physiological_data, dynamic_key):
  seed = hash(dynamic_key + timestamp())
  random_generator = initialize_random_generator(seed)

  mask_pattern = []
  for i in range(mask_complexity):
    x = random_generator.next_float() * face_width
    y = random_generator.next_float() * face_height
    intensity = calculate_intensity(baseline_biometrics, physiological_data) //Based on HRV, skin conductivity, etc.
    mask_pattern.append((x, y, intensity))

  return mask_pattern
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static biometric data and creates a dynamic, evolving biometric signature.  The shifting mask introduces a layer of security against spoofing attacks that target static facial images or 3D models. The integration of physiological data adds a layer of liveness detection.
