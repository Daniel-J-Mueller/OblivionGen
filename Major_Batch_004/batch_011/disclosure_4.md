## Adaptive Network Topology Generation

**Concept:** Dynamically construct and dismantle network paths *between* devices based on real-time sequence lag data, not just identifying the *fastest* existing path. This goes beyond bandwidth identification; it *creates* bandwidth.

**Specification:**

1.  **Topology Map:** A central (or distributed) system maintains a ‘topology map’ – a graph representing all potential network paths between communicating devices. This includes physical paths, virtual paths, and combinations (e.g., multiple hops through intermediate nodes).  Initial map can be pre-populated or discovered.
2.  **Path Probes:**  Devices continuously send "path probe" packets across *multiple* potential paths simultaneously. These probes contain a sequence number (derived from a shared seed, as in the base patent) *and* a timestamp.
3.  **Lag Calculation – Deviation Focus:** Instead of focusing solely on absolute sequence lag, calculate *deviation* from expected lag.  Expected lag is determined by the timestamp and an estimated propagation delay for that path. High deviation indicates congestion or interference.
4.  **Dynamic Path Creation/Destruction:**
    *   If a path exhibits consistently *low deviation* (even if absolute lag is higher than others), the system attempts to ‘activate’ that path by allocating resources (e.g., VLANs, VPN tunnels, routing rules).
    *   Paths exceeding deviation thresholds are ‘deactivated’ (resources released).
    *   Activation/Deactivation is not instantaneous.  A ‘grace period’ allows for smoothing of temporary fluctuations.
5.  **Resource Allocation Manager:**  A module manages resource allocation. It needs to handle:
    *   Competing requests for the same network resources.
    *   Preventing resource exhaustion.
    *   Ensuring network stability during path transitions.
6.  **Path Scoring:**  Each active path receives a score based on deviation, throughput, and resource cost.  The system prioritizes paths with the highest scores.
7.  **Hybrid Routing:** Utilize a hybrid routing strategy. Instead of strictly routing all traffic over the ‘best’ path, distribute traffic across multiple high-scoring paths to maximize overall throughput and resilience.
8.  **Feedback Loop:** The system continuously monitors path performance and adjusts the topology map and routing strategy accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Key Component - Path Activation):**

```
function activatePath(path, resources):
  if resourcesAvailable(resources):
    allocateResources(path, resources)
    path.status = "ACTIVE"
    log("Path activated: " + path.id)
    return true
  else:
    log("Insufficient resources to activate path: " + path.id)
    return false
```

```
function monitorPath(path, probeData):
  deviation = calculateDeviation(probeData)
  if deviation > threshold:
    path.deviationCount++
    if path.deviationCount > maxDeviationCount:
        deactivatePath(path)
  else:
    path.deviationCount = 0
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simply *selecting* the fastest path; it *creates* potential network capacity by dynamically building and dismantling paths based on a more nuanced understanding of network conditions.  The focus on deviation, rather than just absolute lag, allows for the identification of potentially useful paths that might be overlooked by traditional methods. It’s a pro-active network rather than a reactive one.
