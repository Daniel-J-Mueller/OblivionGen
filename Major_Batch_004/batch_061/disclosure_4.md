## Modular, Self-Configuring Fire Suppression Grid for Stacked Storage

**Concept:** A fire suppression system built from interconnected, intelligent nodes that automatically adapt to changing storage configurations and pinpoint fire origin, maximizing suppression efficiency and minimizing damage.

**Specs:**

**1. Node Hardware:**

*   **Dimensions:** 15cm x 15cm x 8cm (approximate).  Designed for mounting flush with the storage module structure, or hanging from existing supports.
*   **Material:** High-temperature, flame-retardant polymer housing.
*   **Spray Nozzle:** Multi-pattern nozzle (wide cone, focused jet, mist) controlled digitally.  Nozzle material: Stainless steel alloy.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Infrared (IR) thermal sensor: Detects heat signatures.
    *   Photoelectric smoke detector.
    *   Gas sensor (CO, CO2, other combustion byproducts).
    *   Microphone array (acoustic signature analysis for fire confirmation).
    *   Proximity sensor (detects presence of storage containers).
*   **Communication:** Wireless mesh network (Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy, or similar).  Each node acts as a repeater.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable battery with wireless charging capability.  Also supports direct power connection.
*   **Microcontroller:**  ARM Cortex-M series or equivalent.  Runs embedded AI algorithms.
*   **Extinguisher Reservoir:** Small, sealed reservoir for localized fire suppression. Uses a fast-acting, environmentally friendly extinguishant (e.g., potassium-based aerosol).  Capacity: 200ml.  Automatic refill system (see Network & Software).

**2. Network & Software:**

*   **Self-Organizing Mesh Network:** Nodes automatically discover and connect to each other, forming a robust and redundant network.
*   **AI-Powered Fire Detection & Localization:** 
    *   Each node runs a lightweight AI model trained to differentiate between genuine fire signatures and false alarms (e.g., dust, mechanical vibrations).
    *   When a node detects a potential fire, it shares the data with neighboring nodes.
    *   A consensus algorithm determines the fire's location based on data from multiple nodes.  This minimizes false positives and pinpoints the origin.
    *   The system uses triangulation or similar techniques to determine the fire's 3D coordinates within the storage module.
*   **Dynamic Suppression Zone Creation:**  Based on the fire’s location, the system dynamically creates a suppression zone – activating only the nodes closest to the fire.  This minimizes extinguishant usage and collateral damage.
*   **Automated Extinguisher Refill:**  A central management system monitors the extinguishant levels in each node.  When a node's level drops below a threshold, a robotic refill station (integrated into the storage module infrastructure) automatically refills it.
*   **Remote Monitoring & Control:**  A cloud-based dashboard allows operators to monitor the system’s status, view sensor data, and control individual nodes or the entire network.
*   **Integration with Storage Management System:**  The fire suppression system integrates with the storage module's inventory management system to identify the type of materials being stored and adjust the suppression strategy accordingly. (e.g. flammable materials)
*   **Digital Twin Integration:** The system generates a digital twin of the storage module’s fire suppression network, allowing for simulations and predictive maintenance.

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   Nodes are mounted strategically throughout the storage module, focusing on areas prone to fire ignition (e.g., near electrical panels, high-friction areas).
*   Nodes are spaced according to the density of stored materials and the required level of fire protection.  (Typical spacing: 2-3 meters).
*   The system utilizes a modular design, allowing for easy expansion and reconfiguration of the storage module.
*   The network topology is adaptable, allowing nodes to automatically reconfigure themselves to maintain connectivity in the event of a node failure or obstruction.

**Pseudocode (Fire Detection & Suppression Logic):**

```
// Node-level fire detection
LOOP:
    sensorData = readSensors()
    fireProbability = analyzeData(sensorData) // AI model
    IF fireProbability > threshold:
        transmitAlert(sensorData)
        activateLocalSuppression()
    ENDIF
ENDLOOP

// Network-level fire localization & suppression
RECEIVE alert FROM node
aggregateData(alert)
localizeFire(aggregatedData)
createSuppressionZone(fireLocation)
activateNodesInZone()

```
