## Dynamic Resource Entanglement for Predictive Security

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Entanglement Engine (EE) - Software defined, deployed as a service within the virtual computing environment.
*   **Resource Types:** Supports all resource types outlined in the base patent (VMs, data stores, etc.) plus containerized applications and serverless functions.
*   **Data Sources:**  EE ingests real-time telemetry from all provisioned resources (CPU/memory usage, network I/O, process activity, log data). It also consumes historical security event data and threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Entanglement Mapping:**  EE dynamically builds a ‘dependency graph’ representing the relationships between resources.  This isn’t a static map; it learns from observed traffic patterns and API calls.  Resources are ‘entangled’ based on communication frequency and criticality.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Uses a time-series forecasting model (LSTM or Transformer-based) trained on historical data to predict potential security violations *before* they occur. The model focuses on anomalies in resource interaction patterns, anticipating attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Posture Adjustment:** If a high probability of a violation is predicted, the EE can dynamically adjust the security posture of entangled resources. This includes:
    *   **Micro-segmentation:** Automatically creating or modifying firewall rules to isolate potentially compromised resources.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Restricting network traffic to and from suspect resources.
    *   **Resource Hibernation:** Temporarily suspending non-critical resources to minimize the attack surface.
    *   **Automated Patching:** Triggering immediate patching of known vulnerabilities on affected resources.
*   **API Integration:** Exposes a comprehensive API for integration with existing security information and event management (SIEM) systems, orchestration platforms, and automated response tools.
*   **Reporting/Visualization:** Provides a dashboard for visualizing resource entanglement, predicted security risks, and automated security adjustments.

**Pseudocode - Predictive Modeling Component:**

```
function predict_security_risk(resource_interaction_data, historical_data):
  # Input:
  #   resource_interaction_data: Real-time data on interactions between resources.
  #   historical_data: Time series data of resource interactions and security events.

  # 1. Feature Extraction:
  #    - Extract relevant features from resource_interaction_data (e.g., traffic volume, packet types, API call frequency).
  #    - Normalize and scale features.

  # 2. Model Training:
  #    - Load pre-trained LSTM or Transformer model.
  #    - Fine-tune the model with historical_data.

  # 3. Prediction:
  #    - Input the extracted features into the trained model.
  #    - Obtain a probability score representing the risk of a security violation.

  # 4. Anomaly Detection:
  #    - Compare the predicted risk score to a predefined threshold.
  #    - If the score exceeds the threshold, flag it as an anomaly.

  return anomaly_flag, risk_score
```

**Innovation Rationale:**

Current pre-deployment security checks are static and reactive. This system introduces *dynamic* and *predictive* security by learning resource relationships and anticipating attacks *before* they occur. It moves beyond simply verifying configurations to actively protecting resources based on observed behavior. The ‘entanglement’ concept adds a layer of contextual awareness, recognizing that a compromise in one resource can quickly spread to others. The automated adjustment of security posture reduces the need for manual intervention and enables a more agile and resilient security environment.
