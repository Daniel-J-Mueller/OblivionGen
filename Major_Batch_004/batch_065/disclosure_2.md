## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Dynamic Ray Tracing & Generative Adversarial Networks

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Hybrid Acoustic Rendering Engine
*   **Input:** Sparse Microphone Array Data (2-8 microphones), Room Geometry (point cloud or CAD model), Material Properties (roughness, absorption coefficients), Source Signal (speech, music, environmental sounds).
*   **Output:** Full-field Acoustic Rendering - Generates a spatially coherent acoustic field representing the sound in the environment.

**Innovation Description:**

This system moves beyond impulse response modeling to real-time acoustic scene reconstruction using a fusion of ray tracing and generative adversarial networks (GANs). The goal is to create a dynamic, interactive acoustic environment, not just a static simulation.

**Phase 1: Ray Tracing for Initial Acoustic Map**

1.  **Ray Launching:** Launch a large number of rays from the sound source, simulating sound propagation.  Rays bounce off surfaces according to their material properties.
2.  **Early Reflections Mapping:**  Track early reflections (first 5-10) and map their arrival times and intensities to a 3D voxel grid representing the room. This grid serves as the initial acoustic map.
3.  **Sparse Data Integration:**  Utilize the sparse microphone array data to refine the initial acoustic map.  Perform beamforming and source localization to identify dominant sound sources and refine the ray tracing paths. Implement a Kalman filter to track sound source movement over time.

**Phase 2: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Late Reflections & Diffuse Field Modeling**

1.  **GAN Training Data:**  Create a training dataset by simulating acoustic environments with varying geometries and material properties.  Record the resulting sound fields.
2.  **GAN Architecture:** Implement a 3D Convolutional GAN.
    *   **Generator:**  Input: Voxel grid (refined ray tracing output).  Output:  Predicted late reflections and diffuse field component.  Uses 3D convolutional layers, upsampling layers, and skip connections.
    *   **Discriminator:** Input:  Voxel grid (either real or generated). Output: Probability that the input is a real sound field.  Uses 3D convolutional layers and downsampling layers.
3.  **GAN Training:** Train the GAN to predict the acoustic field based on the ray-traced initial map.  Use a combination of L1 loss, perceptual loss (based on spectrogram similarity), and adversarial loss.

**Phase 3: Real-Time Rendering & Interactive Control**

1.  **Hybrid Rendering:** Combine the ray-traced early reflections with the GAN-generated late reflections and diffuse field.
2.  **Interactive Control:** Allow users to modify the room geometry, material properties, and sound source position in real-time. The system re-renders the acoustic field dynamically, providing an interactive acoustic experience.
3.  **Auralization:** Output the rendered acoustic field through a multi-channel loudspeaker array, providing an immersive auralization experience.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
//Initialization
Create Room Geometry Model
Define Material Properties
Initialize Microphone Array Data

//Realtime Loop
For each time step:
    //Ray Tracing Phase
    Launch Rays from Source
    Calculate Early Reflections
    Create Initial Acoustic Map (Voxel Grid)

    //GAN Prediction Phase
    Input: Initial Acoustic Map
    Predict Late Reflections & Diffuse Field (using trained GAN)

    //Hybrid Rendering
    Combine Early Reflections (Ray Tracing) + Late Reflections (GAN)
    Output: Spatially Coherent Acoustic Field

    //Auralization
    Render Acoustic Field through Loudspeaker Array
```
