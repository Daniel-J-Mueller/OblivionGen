## Dynamic Network 'Shadowing' & Behavioral Fingerprinting

**Concept:** Extend unauthorized device detection beyond static configuration analysis by creating 'shadow' network segments that mimic production environments and analyzing device behavior within those controlled spaces. This allows for proactive identification of malicious or misconfigured devices *before* they impact the live network, and builds a behavioral fingerprint for legitimate devices.

**Specs:**

*   **Shadow Network Creation:**
    *   Automated provisioning of isolated network segments (VLANs, containerized networks) mirroring segments of the production network. Scale dynamically based on observed traffic patterns.
    *   Configuration mirroring: Capture configuration data (DHCP leases, DNS records, ARP tables) from production segments and replicate in the shadow network. Near real-time synchronization.
    *   Traffic Redirection: Implement a system to subtly redirect a small percentage of traffic destined for specific production devices to corresponding shadow network devices. Utilize techniques like sFlow/NetFlow sampling or lightweight GRE tunneling.

*   **Behavioral Profiling Engine:**
    *   Capture network traffic within shadow segments (full packet capture or metadata).
    *   Analyze traffic patterns: Inter-device communication frequency, protocol usage, packet sizes, timing characteristics.
    *   Machine learning models trained on legitimate device behavior (create baseline profiles).  Anomaly detection algorithms flag deviations.
    *   Establish 'trust scores' for each device based on behavioral consistency.

*   **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   Integrate with existing unauthorized device detection system.  Shadow network analysis provides an additional layer of verification.
    *   Alerting: When a device exhibits anomalous behavior in the shadow network (low trust score, significant deviations from baseline), trigger an alert.
    *   Automated Mitigation: Option to automatically isolate or block the suspect device from the production network.

**Pseudocode (Behavioral Profiling Engine):**

```
// Define a DeviceProfile struct
struct DeviceProfile {
  float avg_packet_size;
  int communication_frequency;
  float protocol_distribution[NUM_PROTOCOLS]; //e.g. [TCP, UDP, ICMP]
  //... other relevant metrics
}

// Function to update DeviceProfile based on observed traffic
void update_profile(DeviceProfile* profile, Packet* packet) {
  //Calculate packet size, protocol, communication patterns etc.
  //Update relevant profile metrics with smoothing / averaging.
}

//Function to calculate anomaly score.
float calculate_anomaly_score(DeviceProfile* observed_profile, DeviceProfile* baseline_profile){
  //calculate distance metric across all profiled features.
  //Normalize to a scale of 0-1.
  return anomaly_score;
}

// Main Loop:
for each Packet in Shadow Network Traffic:
  device_id = extract_device_id(Packet);
  update_profile(device_profiles[device_id], Packet);

  anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(device_profiles[device_id], baseline_profiles[device_id]);

  if anomaly_score > threshold:
    trigger_alert(device_id, anomaly_score);
```

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond static, configuration-based detection to a dynamic, behavioral analysis system.  The 'shadow network' creates a safe environment to observe device behavior without impacting the production network. This allows for proactive identification of threats and a more accurate assessment of device legitimacy. Existing systems focus on *what* a device is configured to do, not *how* it behaves.
