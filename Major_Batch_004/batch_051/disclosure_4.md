## Dynamic Inventory 'Swarm' with Predictive Routing

**Concept:** Extend the mobile drive unit system to operate not as individually directed units, but as a self-organizing 'swarm' responding to real-time demand and proactively positioning inventory. This moves beyond shuffling *within* a pick station to a dynamic, warehouse-wide pre-staging system.

**Specs:**

*   **Unit Hardware:** Each mobile drive unit (MDU) equipped with:
    *   Ultra-wideband (UWB) or similar high-precision location tracking.
    *   Onboard processing unit (capable of running basic pathfinding and swarm algorithms).
    *   Short-range communication (e.g., Bluetooth mesh) for MDU-to-MDU communication *in addition* to central control.
    *   Standardized inventory interface (compatible with existing inventory holders).
    *   Obstacle avoidance sensors (LiDAR, ultrasonic, or similar).
*   **Central Control/Management Module Enhancement:**
    *   Real-time demand prediction algorithm (integrated with sales data, order queues, and historical patterns).
    *   'Heatmap' generation of inventory demand across the warehouse.
    *   Swarm behavior control parameters: (a) Aggression (speed of response to demand), (b) Cohesion (tendency to stay near other MDUs), (c) Separation (minimum distance between MDUs).
*   **Swarm Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
// Each MDU runs this algorithm continuously:
LOOP:
    // 1. Receive Demand Signal from Central Control:
    demand_location = CentralControl.GetDemandLocation(MDU_ID) // Location needing inventory
    demand_priority = CentralControl.GetDemandPriority(MDU_ID)

    // 2. Local Awareness:
    nearby_mdus = SenseNearbyMDUs() // UWB/Short-Range Comm
    nearby_inventory = SenseNearbyInventory() // RFID/Visual

    // 3. Path Planning (A* or similar):
    best_path = CalculatePath(current_location, demand_location, obstacles)

    // 4. Swarm Behavior:
    // Cohesion: Move slightly towards the average position of nearby MDUs
    cohesion_vector = CalculateCohesion(nearby_mdus)
    ApplyVector(best_path, cohesion_vector, weight = 0.1)

    // Separation: Maintain minimum distance from nearby MDUs
    separation_vector = CalculateSeparation(nearby_mdus)
    ApplyVector(best_path, separation_vector, weight = 0.2)

    // 5. Inventory Management:
    IF (carrying_inventory == FALSE AND nearby_inventory.priority > demand_priority):
        acquire_inventory(nearby_inventory)
    ELSE IF (carrying_inventory == TRUE AND current_location == demand_location):
        deliver_inventory()

    // 6. Movement:
    move_along_path(best_path)
ENDLOOP
```

*   **Dynamic Zoning:** Warehouse is divided into dynamically adjustable zones, based on demand. MDUs primarily operate within assigned zones, minimizing congestion.
*   **'Ghosting' Functionality:** If a zone is overloaded, MDUs are temporarily ‘ghosted’ – instructed to hold position until congestion clears, reducing collisions.
*   **Emergency Override:** Central control retains the ability to override swarm behavior for critical inventory needs or safety concerns.
*   **Integration with Existing WMS:** The swarm system integrates seamlessly with the existing Warehouse Management System (WMS), receiving demand signals and updating inventory locations in real-time.
