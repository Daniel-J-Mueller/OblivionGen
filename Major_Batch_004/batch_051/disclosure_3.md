## Adaptive Service Mesh with Predictive Renaming

**Concept:** Extend the service renaming logic to operate *within* a service mesh, proactively anticipating and mitigating disruption during renames by dynamically adjusting traffic routing. Instead of *reacting* to DNS changes, the system *prepares* the mesh for the transition, ensuring minimal client impact.

**Specs:**

**1. Mesh Integration Module:**

*   **Function:** Interfaces with the existing service mesh control plane (e.g., Istio, Linkerd).
*   **Data Input:** Receives renaming requests (new name, old name) and query log analysis data (client usage of old vs. new names).
*   **Output:**  Updates service mesh configurations to gradually shift traffic from the old service name to the new.

**2. Predictive Traffic Shifter:**

*   **Algorithm:** Employs a weighted traffic splitting strategy based on real-time client usage data derived from query logs.
*   **Weight Calculation:** `Weight(new_name) = Count(queries_for_new_name) / (Count(queries_for_new_name) + Count(queries_for_old_name))`
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Traffic weights are recalculated and updated in the service mesh every *n* seconds (configurable).
*   **Client-Specific Routing (Optional):**  Identify clients that have *already* switched (based on query logs) and immediately route 100% of their traffic to the new name.

**3.  Shadow Traffic Mirroring:**

*   **Function:**  Mirror a small percentage (configurable, e.g., 5%) of traffic destined for the old name to the new name. This allows for real-time monitoring of the new service's performance *under load* before fully committing the switch.
*   **Data Analysis:**  Compare response times, error rates, and other metrics between the old and new services. If discrepancies are detected, automatically rollback the traffic shift and alert administrators.

**4.  Query Log Enrichment:**

*   **Process:** Enhance query logs with additional information:
    *   Client network address (as in the original patent).
    *   Service version.
    *   Client application ID.
*   **Purpose:**  Enable more granular traffic control and targeted rollout strategies. For example, prioritize switching clients using older service versions.

**5.  Automated Rollback:**

*   **Trigger:** If error rates or response times on the new service exceed a predefined threshold, automatically revert traffic to the old name.
*   **Mechanism:**  Service mesh configuration is restored to its pre-switch state.
*   **Alerting:**  Administrators are notified of the rollback event.

**Pseudocode (Traffic Shifter):**

```
function update_traffic_weights(query_logs):
  count_old = calculate_query_count(query_logs, old_name)
  count_new = calculate_query_count(query_logs, new_name)
  total_count = count_old + count_new

  weight_new = total_count > 0 ? (float(count_new) / total_count) : 0.0
  weight_old = 1.0 - weight_new

  update_service_mesh(old_name, weight_old)
  update_service_mesh(new_name, weight_new)

function update_service_mesh(service_name, weight):
  # Interface with service mesh control plane (e.g., Istio)
  # Update traffic routing rules to send 'weight' proportion of traffic to 'service_name'
  # (Specific implementation will depend on the service mesh technology used)
  pass

function calculate_query_count(query_logs, service_name):
  count = 0
  for log in query_logs:
    if log.queried_name == service_name:
      count += 1
  return count
```

**Deployment:**

*   Deploy as a sidecar within the provider network's infrastructure.
*   Integrate with existing monitoring and alerting systems.
*   Configure thresholds and weights based on service criticality and client population.
