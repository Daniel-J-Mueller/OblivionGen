## Dynamic Module Categorization for Promotion

**Specification:** A system to dynamically categorize software modules based on real-time usage patterns and risk profiles, influencing promotion criteria.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on code coverage as a primary promotion gate. However, a module's criticality isn’t solely determined by test coverage. Actual runtime behavior – how frequently it’s used, the data it processes, and its impact on system stability – are equally important. This system introduces a dynamic layer of risk assessment *in addition* to code coverage, refining promotion decisions.

**Components:**

*   **Usage Monitor:** Deployed as a lightweight agent alongside each module. Collects runtime metrics: invocation frequency, data throughput, error rates, and dependency calls.
*   **Risk Profile Engine:** An AI-driven system trained on historical data (production incidents, security vulnerabilities, performance regressions). It analyzes usage data from the Usage Monitor and assigns a real-time risk score to each module.  Risk score factors include:
    *   **Invocation Frequency:** High-frequency modules have higher potential impact.
    *   **Data Sensitivity:** Modules handling sensitive data (PII, financial information) require stricter promotion criteria.
    *   **Dependency Depth:** Modules with many dependencies introduce more potential failure points.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Real-time identification of unusual behavior (e.g., sudden increase in error rates).
*   **Dynamic Promotion Criteria Manager:** Integrates with existing promotion pipelines.  Adjusts promotion thresholds (code coverage, performance benchmarks) *based* on the module's real-time risk score.  Higher risk = stricter requirements.
*   **Categorization Database:** Persistent storage for learned module characteristics and associated risk profiles. Enables faster risk assessment for new module versions.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Promotion Criteria Adjustment):**

```
FUNCTION AdjustPromotionCriteria(moduleID, codeCoverage, baseThreshold)

    riskScore = GetRiskScore(moduleID)

    IF riskScore > 0.8 THEN // High Risk
        adjustedThreshold = baseThreshold * 1.2 // Increase coverage requirement
    ELSE IF riskScore > 0.5 THEN // Medium Risk
        adjustedThreshold = baseThreshold * 1.1
    ELSE // Low Risk
        adjustedThreshold = baseThreshold

    IF codeCoverage >= adjustedThreshold THEN
        RETURN "Promote"
    ELSE
        RETURN "Do Not Promote"
    ENDIF

END FUNCTION
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The Risk Profile Engine can leverage machine learning techniques (e.g., anomaly detection, classification) to accurately assess module risk.
*   The Usage Monitor should be designed for minimal performance overhead.
*   The Categorization Database should be scalable to handle a large number of modules.
*   Integration with existing CI/CD pipelines is crucial for seamless operation.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Automated rollback of promoted modules based on real-time risk assessment.
*   Predictive risk modeling to proactively identify potential issues before promotion.
*   Integration with security vulnerability scanners to incorporate security risk into the promotion decision.
