## Dynamic Framing & Predictive Notification System

**Concept:** Extend the facial quality detection and notification system to *predict* likely points of interest *before* they fully resolve within the frame, and dynamically adjust the framing to prioritize those areas. This moves beyond reactive notification to proactive capture and pre-emptive notification.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **A/V Device:** Standard camera/microphone array as in the base patent.
*   **Processing Unit:**  Increased processing power for real-time analysis and predictive modeling. (GPU acceleration highly recommended)
*   **Gimbal/PTZ Control:**  Mechanically adjustable camera mount (pan, tilt, zoom) capable of smooth, rapid movement.
*   **Depth Sensor:**  Time-of-Flight or Structured Light sensor for creating a 3D understanding of the environment.
*   **IR Illuminator:** For low-light operation enhancing facial/feature detection.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Predictive Interest Model (PIM):** Core AI module. Trained on vast datasets of human behavior (gaze direction, body language, common actions - e.g., reaching for an object, looking at another person). PIM analyzes scene context (from depth sensor & image data) and predicts likely areas of interest *before* they become fully visible.  Outputs probability maps indicating likely focus areas.
*   **Dynamic Framing Controller (DFC):**  Receives probability maps from PIM.  Uses these to control the gimbal/PTZ mechanism, adjusting the camera angle/zoom to keep the predicted area of interest centered within the frame. Prioritizes keeping faces *within* the dynamic frame.
*   **Enhanced Facial Quality Assessment (EFQA):** Refined version of the existing facial quality detection.  Considers not just resolution/clarity, but also *predictive* quality - how likely a face is to become fully identifiable *given* the current motion and environmental conditions.
*   **Pre-emptive Notification Engine (PNE):** Generates notifications *before* a "high-quality" face is fully captured. Sends a notification preview with a lower-resolution image or a visual indicator highlighting the predicted area of interest. Allows the user to accept/reject the pre-emptive notification.
*   **Contextual Data Integration:** Integrates data from other sensors (e.g., environmental sensors detecting sudden changes in light levels or sound) to refine the PIM predictions.

**3. Algorithm/Pseudocode (PIM - simplified):**

```pseudocode
// Input: Image data, Depth data, Contextual data
// Output: Probability map of areas of interest

function predictInterest(imageData, depthData, contextualData):
    // 1. Scene Understanding:
    sceneType = analyzeScene(imageData) // e.g., "living room", "office", "outdoor"
    objectDetection = detectObjects(imageData) // identify objects in the scene
    personDetection = detectPersons(imageData) // detect persons in the scene

    // 2. Behavioral Prediction:
    //   - Based on scene type, common behaviors are weighted.
    //   - Consider object interactions (e.g., person near a table = likely interaction).
    //   - Use depth data to estimate gaze direction (where a person is looking).
    behavioralWeights = getBehavioralWeights(sceneType, objectDetection, personDetection, depthData)

    // 3. Probability Map Generation:
    probabilityMap = createProbabilityMap(behavioralWeights)
    //   - Areas with higher weighted behaviors have higher probabilities.
    //   - Smooth the map to reduce noise.

    return probabilityMap
```

**4. Notification Workflow:**

1.  A/V device captures image/depth data.
2.  PIM predicts areas of interest and generates a probability map.
3.  DFC dynamically adjusts the camera framing to prioritize predicted areas.
4.  EFQA assesses facial quality (including predictive quality).
5.  If predictive quality exceeds a threshold:
    a. PNE generates a pre-emptive notification with a preview image/indicator.
    b. User accepts/rejects the notification.
6.  If user accepts/no action: Capture frame and send notification.
7.  Continuous loop â€“ the system continually refines its predictions and dynamically adjusts the framing.
