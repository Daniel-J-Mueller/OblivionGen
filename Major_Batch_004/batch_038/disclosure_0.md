## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Spatial Audio Anchors

**Concept:** Extend the playback delay synchronization to not just *time* align audio, but to reconstruct a dynamic acoustic scene. Imagine a virtual environment where sound sources move. Current systems largely focus on getting the sound *to* the listener at the right time. This aims to create a much richer, spatially accurate soundscape by actively mapping and recreating the acoustic reflections and diffraction patterns of a space in real-time.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 8 mics) integrated into a portable device (think high-end speaker or dedicated sensor unit).
    *   High-fidelity DAC/ADC.
    *   Processing unit with sufficient power for real-time signal processing (ARM or similar).
    *   Wireless communication (Bluetooth 5.0 or Wi-Fi 6) for data transmission.
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Acoustic Mapping Core:**
        *   Uses the synchronized delay data (from the provided patent’s core tech) as the foundation.
        *   Employs beamforming and time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) algorithms to identify and track sound sources.
        *   Maps the room's geometry based on identified reflections and diffraction points.  Creates a point cloud representation of the acoustic environment.
        *   Acoustic material identification: Attempt to categorize surfaces (soft, hard, reflective, absorbent) based on frequency response of reflections. This impacts ray tracing.
    *   **Dynamic Ray Tracing Engine:**
        *   Uses the acoustic map to simulate sound propagation in real-time.
        *   Calculates realistic reflections, diffraction, and attenuation based on surface properties and source position.
        *   Allows for the creation of a ‘virtual microphone’ which can be moved within the simulated space.
    *   **Spatial Audio Anchors:**
        *   Identifies stable acoustic features within the environment (e.g., a large wall, a corner). These serve as ‘anchors’ for the acoustic map.
        *   Uses these anchors to maintain map accuracy even as the device or sound sources move.
        *   The anchors are identified using a combination of persistent reflections and frequency analysis.
    *   **Audio Rendering:**
        *   Uses head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to create a 3D soundscape.
        *   Renders the audio based on the simulated sound propagation paths.
        *   Supports dynamic HRTF adjustment based on listener position and head orientation (requires integration with a head tracker).

**Pseudocode (Core Mapping Loop):**

```
// Initialize microphone array and processing unit
// Calibrate the system and establish baseline noise levels

loop:
    // Capture audio data from microphone array
    audio_data = capture_audio()

    // Synchronize the audio data using the delay algorithm from the patent
    synchronized_audio = synchronize_audio(audio_data)

    // Beamform and TDoA to identify potential sound sources
    sources = identify_sources(synchronized_audio)

    // Ray trace the environment to map reflections and diffraction
    acoustic_map = map_environment(sources)

    // Update the acoustic map based on new data
    updated_map = refine_map(acoustic_map, sources)

    // Identify and update spatial anchors
    anchors = update_anchors(updated_map)

    // Render audio based on the updated map and HRTFs
    rendered_audio = render_audio(updated_map, anchors)

    // Output rendered audio
    output_audio(rendered_audio)

    // Repeat
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Immersive VR/AR experiences.
*   Enhanced teleconferencing with realistic spatial audio.
*   Acoustic scene reconstruction for security and surveillance.
*   Personalized audio experiences tailored to the user's environment.
*   Real-time acoustic modeling for architectural design.
