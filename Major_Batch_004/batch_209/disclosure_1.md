## Dynamic Sentiment-Driven Topic Evolution

**Concept:** Extend the static topic modeling with a system that dynamically evolves topics based on shifting sentiment trends within customer reviews over time. Instead of a fixed topic list, the system will detect emerging sub-topics *within* existing topics, driven by sentiment changes.

**Specs:**

1.  **Temporal Review Segmentation:** Customer reviews are segmented into time windows (e.g., weekly, monthly). 
2.  **Initial Topic Baseline:**  A static topic model (LDA as in the patent) is run on the *entire* review corpus to establish initial, broad topics.
3.  **Sentiment Trend Analysis:** For each time window *and* each initial topic, calculate the average sentiment score of reviews assigned to that topic.  A significant shift in average sentiment (positive to negative, or vice-versa) triggers a sub-topic analysis.  A 'significant shift' will be a tunable parameter.
4.  **Sub-Topic Extraction (Sliding Window Approach):** When a sentiment shift is detected, a smaller, sliding window of recent reviews (e.g., the last 4 weeks) *within* that topic is analyzed using a denser topic modeling algorithm (e.g., NMF or BERTopic) to identify emergent sub-topics.
5.  **Topic Graph Construction:** Represent topic evolution as a directed graph. Initial topics are root nodes.  Emergent sub-topics become child nodes connected to their parent topic. Edge weights represent the strength of the sentiment shift and the frequency of the sub-topic.
6.  **Representative Sentence Selection Enhancement:** When selecting representative sentences, prioritize sentences from sub-topics with the *most recent* and *strongest* sentiment shifts.
7.  **User Interface Visualization:** Display the topic graph to analysts, allowing them to explore how topics are evolving and identify emerging concerns or positive feedback trends.  Enable filtering by sentiment and time.
8.  **Alerting Mechanism:** Configure alerts to notify analysts when specific topics exhibit rapid sentiment changes or the emergence of new sub-topics.

**Pseudocode (Sub-Topic Extraction):**

```
FUNCTION extract_sub_topics(topic_id, time_window, reviews)
  filtered_reviews = SELECT reviews WHERE review.topic_id == topic_id AND review.timestamp WITHIN time_window
  
  IF len(filtered_reviews) < threshold THEN
    RETURN empty list
  ENDIF
  
  sub_topics = RUN denser topic model (NMF/BERTopic) ON filtered_reviews 
  
  filtered_sub_topics = REMOVE subtopics with low frequency 
  
  RETURN filtered_sub_topics
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Early Issue Detection:** Identify emerging product defects or negative feedback trends before they become widespread.
*   **Feature Prioritization:** Understand which product features are driving positive or negative sentiment.
*   **Marketing Campaign Optimization:** Tailor marketing messages to address specific concerns or highlight popular features.
*   **Competitive Analysis:** Track how customer sentiment towards competitors is evolving.
