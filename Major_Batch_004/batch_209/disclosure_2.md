## Adaptive Resource Shaping via Predictive Token Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the token bucket approach with predictive analytics to *proactively* shape resource allocation based on anticipated customer demand, rather than purely reactive throttling. This allows for optimized resource utilization and potentially higher overall throughput, moving beyond simply preventing overload.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Predictive Model:**

*   **Data Sources:** Collect historical resource usage data *per customer* (CPU, memory, network I/O, API calls – similar to existing monitoring, but with increased granularity), application-level metrics (e.g., transaction rates, queue depths), and external signals (e.g., time of day, day of week, promotional events, regional events).
*   **Model Training:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet, or a transformer-based model) to predict each customer's resource demand *over a sliding window* (e.g., 5-15 minutes ahead).  The model will be trained and updated continuously using online learning techniques.
*   **Demand Profiles:** Create individual “Demand Profiles” for each customer, representing their predicted resource needs. Profiles include confidence intervals around the predictions, accounting for uncertainty.

**2. Predictive Token Allocation:**

*   **Pre-Allocation:** Based on the Demand Profile, *pre-allocate* a portion of the global token bucket to each customer. The pre-allocation amount is determined by the predicted demand and a risk factor derived from the confidence interval.  Higher uncertainty results in a smaller pre-allocation and more reserved capacity.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Continuously monitor actual resource usage. If a customer's usage exceeds the pre-allocated tokens, begin throttling *before* hitting the global maximum. Conversely, if usage is consistently below predictions, *increase* pre-allocation (within limits) to allow for burstier behavior.
*   **Tiered Token Pools:** Implement multiple tiers within the global token bucket:
    *   **Guaranteed Pool:** Tokens pre-allocated based on the Demand Profile. High priority.
    *   **Opportunistic Pool:** Tokens available to customers who are *underutilizing* their pre-allocated capacity, or who are requesting additional resources *during* periods of low global demand.  Lower priority.
    *   **Emergency Pool:**  A small reserve for handling unexpected spikes in demand from critical customers, or to prevent system-wide outages.

**3. Resource Shaping & Prioritization:**

*   **Quality of Service (QoS) Levels:** Allow customers to subscribe to different QoS levels (e.g., Silver, Gold, Platinum) that determine their priority for accessing the Emergency Pool and their overall pre-allocation.
*   **Application-Aware Shaping:** Extend the token bucket model to be aware of *application-level* requests.  Prioritize critical transactions or operations over less important ones.
*   **Adaptive Resource Limits:**  Dynamically adjust resource limits (CPU cores, memory allocation) *per customer* based on their current token balance and QoS level.

**Pseudocode (Token Allocation Logic):**

```
// Input: customerId, requestAmount, globalTokenBucket, customerDemandProfile
// Output: grantedAmount, updatedGlobalTokenBucket, updatedCustomerTokenBucket

function allocateTokens(customerId, requestAmount, globalTokenBucket, customerDemandProfile) {
    predictedDemand = customerDemandProfile.getPredictedDemand();
    confidenceInterval = customerDemandProfile.getConfidenceInterval();

    preAllocatedTokens = calculatePreAllocation(predictedDemand, confidenceInterval);
    availableTokens = min(requestAmount, preAllocatedTokens + globalTokenBucket.getAvailableTokens());

    grantedAmount = availableTokens;
    globalTokenBucket.consumeTokens(grantedAmount);

    customerDemandProfile.updateDemand(grantedAmount);

    return grantedAmount, globalTokenBucket, customerDemandProfile;
}
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:**  The predictive model and token allocation logic must be highly scalable to handle a large number of customers and requests.
*   **Real-time Performance:** Token allocation must be performed in real-time to avoid introducing latency.
*   **Model Accuracy:**  The accuracy of the predictive model is critical to the success of this approach.  Continuous monitoring and retraining are essential.
*   **Security:** Implement appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the token buckets and predictive models.
