## Predictive Bundling & Gifting System

**Core Concept:** Expand the “purchased by a contact” notification to *proactively* bundle items based on shared purchase history and inferred needs, with a built-in gifting mechanism. 

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Integration:**

*   **Purchase History:** Maintain detailed purchase history for each user, categorized by item type, frequency, and spending.
*   **Contact Network:** User-defined contact network (as in the original patent), plus inferred relationships (e.g., frequent co-purchasers).
*   **Life Event Data:** Integrate (with user permission) with calendar data, social media activity (e.g., Facebook events, LinkedIn job changes), and publicly available data to infer life events (birthdays, weddings, new jobs, moving).
*   **Preference Profiles:** Build detailed preference profiles for each user based on purchase history, browsing behavior, stated preferences (surveys, wishlists), and inferred preferences from contact networks.

**2. Predictive Bundle Generation:**

*   **Bundle Algorithm:**  Develop an algorithm that identifies potential bundles based on:
    *   **Shared Purchases:**  Items frequently purchased together by a user's contacts.
    *   **Complementary Items:** Items naturally used in conjunction (e.g., camera + memory card, coffee maker + filters).
    *   **Life Event Correlation:** Items relevant to inferred life events (e.g., baby shower gift bundle for a friend expecting a child).
    *   **Preference Matching:** Items matching the preferences of both the gifting user and the recipient.
*   **Bundle Presentation:** Display “Recommended Bundles for [Contact Name]” on the catalog page when a user is browsing items.  Show bundle contents, total price, and a “Gift Now” button.

**3. Gifting Mechanism:**

*   **Gift Options:** Allow the user to select:
    *   **Delivery Address:** Specify a delivery address (recipient's address or their own).
    *   **Gift Message:**  Compose a personalized gift message.
    *   **Gift Wrap:**  Option to add gift wrap.
    *   **Delivery Date:** Schedule a specific delivery date.
*   **Payment Integration:** Integrate with existing payment gateways.
*   **Gift Notification:** Automatically notify the recipient that a gift is on its way (email/SMS notification).

**4.  "Anticipatory Gifting" Feature:**

*   **AI-Driven Suggestions:** Based on the data above, proactively suggest gifts to users *before* any event or occasion.  Example: “Your friend [Contact Name]’s birthday is in 2 weeks.  Here are some gift suggestions based on their past purchases.”
*   **“Group Gifting” Facilitation:** Allow multiple users to contribute to a single gift.  Create a shared gift link to collect contributions.

**Pseudocode (Anticipatory Gifting):**

```
function suggest_gifts(user_id, contact_id):
  contact_profile = get_contact_profile(contact_id)
  recent_purchases = get_recent_purchases(contact_id)
  inferred_events = get_inferred_events(contact_id)

  potential_gifts = []

  // Suggest gifts based on recent purchases
  for purchase in recent_purchases:
    potential_gifts.append(find_complementary_items(purchase))

  // Suggest gifts based on inferred events
  for event in inferred_events:
    potential_gifts.append(find_gifts_for_event(event))

  // Filter out items already owned
  owned_items = get_owned_items(contact_id)
  potential_gifts = [item for item in potential_gifts if item not in owned_items]

  // Rank items by relevance (based on multiple factors)
  ranked_gifts = rank_gifts(potential_gifts)

  return top_n_gifts(ranked_gifts, 5) // Return top 5 suggestions
```

**System Architecture:**

*   **Microservices:** Implement functionality as independent microservices (e.g., Purchase History Service, Contact Network Service, Recommendation Service, Gifting Service).
*   **API Gateway:** Provide a unified API for accessing microservices.
*   **Data Storage:** Utilize a combination of relational databases (for structured data) and NoSQL databases (for flexible data).
*   **Machine Learning Platform:** Utilize a machine learning platform for building and deploying recommendation models.
