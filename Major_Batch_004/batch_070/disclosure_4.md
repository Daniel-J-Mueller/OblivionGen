## Automated Cart Sorting & Dynamic Routing System

**System Overview:** Expand beyond simple presence detection at a cart station to create a dynamic, intelligent sorting and routing system for automated carts within a restricted area. This goes beyond just knowing *a* cart is present, to knowing *which* cart, *what* its contents are (at a high level), and dynamically routing it to a specific destination within the restricted area *without* human intervention.

**Core Components:**

*   **Cart Identification:** Utilize the existing dual-sensor approach (first/second sensor) but *augment* it with RFID tags attached to each cart. The sensors detect initial presence, then the RFID reader confirms identity and pulls associated data (destination, contents category).
*   **Content Categorization:** Integrate basic weight sensors into the cart station floor. Weight, combined with RFID data, provides a coarse content category (e.g., “raw materials”, “finished goods”, “hazardous waste”). This allows pre-sorting.
*   **Dynamic Routing Network:** Replace fixed routing with a network of automated rail switches and/or dynamically reconfigurable conveyor sections. The system calculates the optimal route based on cart identity, content category, and real-time congestion data.
*   **AI-Powered Route Optimization:** A central processing unit runs a route optimization algorithm. This algorithm considers:
    *   Destination location.
    *   Cart content category.
    *   Real-time congestion on different routes (detected by sensors along the routing network).
    *   Priority levels (some carts may need faster delivery).
*   **Visual Guidance System:**  Projected light paths or AR displays guide the automated drive units along the calculated route.

**Pseudocode (Route Calculation):**

```
function calculate_route(cart_id, destination, content_category, congestion_data, priority) {

  // Retrieve cart details (destination overrides RFID data if present)
  cart_destination = get_destination(cart_id) or destination;

  // Get a list of possible routes to the destination
  possible_routes = get_possible_routes(current_location, cart_destination);

  // Score each route based on congestion, distance, and priority
  for each route in possible_routes {
    route_score = 0;
    route_score += congestion_data[route] * -1; // Penalize congested routes
    route_score += route.distance * -0.1; // Slightly penalize longer routes
    route_score += priority * 0.2; // Prioritize urgent carts
  }

  // Select the route with the highest score
  best_route = select_best_route(best_route);

  return best_route;
}
```

**Sensor Integration:**

*   **First Sensor/Second Sensor:** Initial cart detection, speed estimation.
*   **RFID Reader:** Cart identification, destination data, content category.
*   **Weight Sensors:** Coarse content categorization.
*   **Congestion Sensors:** (Ultrasonic, LiDAR, or Camera-based) Monitor traffic flow along the routing network.
*   **Rail/Conveyor Position Sensors:** Track position of rail switches and conveyor sections.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Communication:** Wireless communication between carts, sensors, and central processing unit (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy).
*   **Power:** Powered rail system or onboard batteries for automated drive units.
*   **Safety:** Emergency stop buttons, obstacle detection sensors, light curtains.
*   **Scalability:** Modular design allows for easy expansion of the routing network.
*   **Software:** Real-time operating system, route optimization algorithm, data analytics dashboard.
