## Dynamic Temporal Resolution Shifting

**Concept:** Expand upon the frame rate adjustment concept to create a system which not only *slows down* action, but dynamically adjusts temporal resolution based on detected *cognitive load* within a scene. The system monitors viewer biometric data (eye tracking, EEG – potentially inferred from wearable device data) to determine moments of high or low cognitive processing, then alters playback speed *in real-time* to optimize comprehension and engagement.

**Specifications:**

*   **Input:** Digital video file, real-time biometric data stream (eye tracking, EEG, heart rate variability).
*   **Processing Modules:**
    *   **Scene/Shot Analysis:** (As per the existing patent) - Segment video into scenes/shots for localized processing.
    *   **Biometric Data Acquisition:** Collects and preprocesses biometric data.
    *   **Cognitive Load Estimation:**  A machine learning model trained to estimate cognitive load from biometric data. Inputs include:
        *   Eye Fixation Duration/Frequency: Longer/more frequent fixations indicate higher cognitive load.
        *   Pupil Dilation:  Increased dilation correlates with increased cognitive effort.
        *   EEG Patterns:  Specific frequency bands (e.g., theta, alpha) associated with cognitive processing.
        *   Heart Rate Variability: Lower HRV indicates increased stress/cognitive load.
    *   **Temporal Resolution Control:** Adjusts playback speed (frame rate) based on estimated cognitive load:
        *   High Cognitive Load: *Slow down* playback speed to allow more time for processing.  Increase frame blending.
        *   Low Cognitive Load: *Speed up* playback speed (within acceptable limits) to maintain engagement. Reduce frame blending.
*   **Output:** Adjusted digital video stream with dynamic temporal resolution.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function adjust_temporal_resolution(video_frame, biometric_data) {
  scene = analyze_scene(video_frame);
  cognitive_load = estimate_cognitive_load(biometric_data);

  if (cognitive_load > threshold_high) {
    adjusted_frame = slow_down(video_frame, factor = 0.5); //Reduce frame rate
    adjusted_frame = apply_frame_blending(adjusted_frame, intensity = 0.8); //Smooth transitions
  } else if (cognitive_load < threshold_low) {
    adjusted_frame = speed_up(video_frame, factor = 1.2); // Increase frame rate
    adjusted_frame = reduce_frame_blending(adjusted_frame, intensity = 0.2);
  } else {
    adjusted_frame = video_frame; // No change
  }

  return adjusted_frame;
}

//Functions for slowing down/speeding up/applying blending can be implemented using standard video processing techniques.
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance processor for real-time video processing and machine learning.
*   Dedicated graphics processing unit (GPU) for accelerated video rendering and machine learning.
*   Biometric data acquisition devices (eye tracker, EEG headset – potentially integrated into VR/AR devices).

**Potential Applications:**

*   Educational videos: Dynamically adjust speed to match student comprehension levels.
*   Training simulations:  Slow down critical moments for improved learning.
*   Entertainment: Enhance immersion and engagement by optimizing the viewing experience.
*   Accessibility: Provide adaptive viewing for individuals with cognitive impairments.
