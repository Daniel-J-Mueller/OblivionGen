## Acoustic Shadowing & Predictive Soundscape

**Concept:** Expand the simulated occupancy beyond simple playback of recorded sounds. Create a dynamic acoustic “shadow” that reacts to external stimuli and *predicts* likely internal sounds based on time of day, learned user behavior, and detected external events.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sensor Fusion Module:**

*   **Input:** Video doorbell camera (object detection – people, pets, vehicles), microphone array (ambient sound analysis), external weather data feed, user calendar/schedule integration (optional – requires user permission).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Real-time object detection identifies potential external stimuli.
    *   Ambient sound analysis establishes a baseline noise profile.
    *   Calendar/schedule data provides context (e.g., "user typically watches TV at 7 PM").
    *   Weather data informs likely behavior (e.g., rain = increased indoor activity).

**2. Predictive Sound Engine:**

*   **Core:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a large dataset of home soundscapes (sourced from publicly available datasets, or ethically sourced/anonymized user data with explicit consent).
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Based on sensor fusion input, the RNN *predicts* the probability distribution of likely indoor sounds (e.g., footsteps, TV, music, conversation).
    *   Outputs a dynamic soundscape "recipe" – a weighted list of sound events and their timing.
    *   Learning component: The engine continuously refines its predictions based on observed user behavior (e.g., if user always turns on the radio after 7 PM, the engine increases the probability of radio sounds).

**3. Spatial Audio Rendering Module:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-speaker system (minimum 5.1 surround sound, ideally more for larger spaces). Distributed microphones for sound source localization.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Renders the predicted soundscape in 3D space.
    *   Simulates sound propagation and reflection based on room geometry (requires initial room mapping – see below).
    *   Dynamically adjusts sound source locations and volumes to create a realistic and immersive acoustic environment.
    *   Utilizes Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) for individualized sound localization (optional – requires user profile).

**4. Room Mapping & Calibration:**

*   **Process:** Uses the video doorbell camera and/or dedicated sensors (e.g., LiDAR) to create a 3D map of the interior space.
*   **Data:** Captures room dimensions, furniture layout, and surface materials (to model sound reflection).
*   **Calibration:** Uses the microphone array to measure acoustic characteristics of the room and optimize sound rendering parameters.

**5. Adaptive Volume Control:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors ambient noise levels and adjusts playback volume accordingly.
*   **Algorithm:** Utilizes a psychoacoustic model to ensure that the simulated sounds are audible but not intrusive.
*   **Goal:** Maintain a consistent level of perceived occupancy without drawing undue attention.

**Pseudocode – Predictive Sound Engine:**

```
function predictSoundscape(sensorData, userSchedule, historicalData) {
  // Input: sensorData (external events), userSchedule, historicalData (past sound events)

  // RNN forward pass to predict probability distribution of sound events
  predictedSoundEvents = RNN(sensorData, userSchedule, historicalData);

  // Select sound events based on probability and diversity
  selectedEvents = selectDiverseEvents(predictedSoundEvents, diversityThreshold);

  // Generate soundscape recipe (event, timing, volume, spatial location)
  soundscapeRecipe = generateRecipe(selectedEvents);

  return soundscapeRecipe;
}

function selectDiverseEvents(predictedEvents, diversityThreshold) {
  // Algorithm to select a diverse set of sound events based on their category.
  // E.g. avoid selecting only footsteps or only TV sounds.
}

function generateRecipe(selectedEvents) {
  // Algorithm to create a recipe detailing the timing, volume, and spatial location of each sound event.
}
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple playback to *proactive* sound simulation. By predicting likely sounds based on context and behavior, it creates a more convincing and nuanced illusion of occupancy. The spatial audio rendering further enhances the realism, making it harder to distinguish between simulated and genuine sounds. This goes beyond the currently available offerings which focus on *reactive* sound triggered by motion detection, to a system that *anticipates* occupancy.
