## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System – Project ‘Synapse’

**Concept:** Augment the finger-tracking system with localized haptic feedback, delivered via a wearable device (glove or ring), to simulate textures and edges on the projected interface. This creates a more immersive and intuitive user experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Miniature ultrasonic transducers integrated into a wearable device (glove fingers or ring band). Minimum of 5 transducers per finger/band.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in wearable device for precise hand/finger tracking and orientation.
    *   Low-latency wireless communication (Bluetooth 6.0 or UWB) to the computing device.
    *   Microcontroller within the wearable for processing haptic patterns.
    *   Power source: Rechargeable solid-state battery (minimum 4 hours runtime).
*   **Software:**
    *   **Haptic Pattern Library:** A database of pre-defined haptic patterns corresponding to common UI elements (buttons, sliders, textures).
    *   **Real-time Texture Synthesis:** Algorithm that generates haptic patterns on-the-fly based on visual data from the interface. Input: Image data, depth map, material properties. Output: Array of transducer activation signals.
    *   **Finger/Hand Pose Estimation:** Integrates data from the finger-tracking system and IMU to determine the precise position and orientation of the user’s fingers.
    *   **Collision Detection:** Detects when the user’s finger ‘collides’ with a virtual UI element.
    *   **Haptic Rendering Engine:** Coordinates the activation of the ultrasonic transducers to create the desired haptic effect.
    *   **Calibration Routine:** Allows the user to customize the haptic feedback intensity and patterns.
*   **Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop

while (true) {
    // 1. Get Finger Position from Tracking System
    finger_position = tracking_system.get_finger_position();

    // 2. Get Hand Orientation from IMU
    hand_orientation = imu.get_orientation();

    // 3. Render Visual Interface
    render_interface(finger_position, hand_orientation);

    // 4. Detect UI Element Collision
    ui_element = detect_collision(finger_position);

    // 5. If collision detected
    if (ui_element != null) {
        // 6. Determine haptic pattern for UI element
        haptic_pattern = get_haptic_pattern(ui_element);

        // 7. Generate transducer activation signals
        transducer_signals = generate_signals(haptic_pattern, finger_position);

        // 8. Send signals to wearable device
        wearable.send_signals(transducer_signals);
    } else {
        // 9. Turn off haptic feedback
        wearable.turn_off_haptics();
    }
}
```

*   **Transducer Control:** Each transducer will operate at a frequency range of 20-100 kHz. Pulse-width modulation (PWM) will be used to control the amplitude of the ultrasonic waves, allowing for precise control of the haptic feedback intensity.

*   **Advanced Features:** Implement AI-driven texture prediction. The system learns the user’s preferences and predicts the desired haptic feedback based on their interaction patterns.
