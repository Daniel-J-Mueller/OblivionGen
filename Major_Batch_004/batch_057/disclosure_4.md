## Adaptive Partition Health Prediction & Proactive Migration

**Concept:** Extend the partition state awareness beyond active/passive/fenced to *predict* potential failures based on resource utilization and historical performance, and proactively migrate workloads *before* a failure occurs. This differs from reactive failover.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Analysis Module (DCAM):**

*   **Metrics:** Collect granular metrics from each partition host: CPU utilization, memory pressure, disk I/O, network latency, application-specific metrics (e.g., queue depths, request processing times).
*   **Historical Data Storage:** Store time-series data for at least 30 days. Utilize a scalable time-series database (e.g., Prometheus, InfluxDB).
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement machine learning algorithms (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA) to identify anomalies in metric trends. Algorithms must be trained per application *and* partition to account for baseline variations.
*   **Health Score Calculation:** Assign a ‘health score’ to each partition based on anomaly detection, historical performance, and configurable weights for each metric.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Use the health score and historical data to predict the probability of partition failure within a defined time window (e.g., 15 minutes, 1 hour).  The prediction model must dynamically adjust based on real-time data and recent failures.

**2. Proactive Migration Manager (PMM):**

*   **Migration Threshold:** Configure a threshold for the predicted failure probability that triggers proactive migration.
*   **Candidate Selection:** Identify workloads eligible for migration based on pre-defined criteria (e.g., stateless services, services with minimal data synchronization overhead).
*   **Migration Orchestration:** Coordinate the migration of selected workloads to a healthy partition *before* the predicted failure. This includes:
    *   Updating DNS records or load balancer configurations.
    *   Synchronizing any necessary data.
    *   Gracefully shutting down services on the failing partition.
    *   Starting services on the destination partition.
*   **Verification:** Verify the successful migration by monitoring the health of the destination partition and the performance of migrated workloads.

**3. Integration with Existing System:**

*   **API Integration:**  Integrate with the existing first computing system (from the patent) via a REST API. The DCAM reports health scores and predicted failure probabilities. The PMM requests migration orchestration.
*   **Partition State Awareness:** Update the existing partition state model to include a ‘predictive failure’ state. This state triggers the PMM.
*   **Alerting:** Generate alerts when a partition enters the ‘predictive failure’ state or when a migration is initiated.

**Pseudocode (PMM - Migration Initiation):**

```
function initiate_migration(partition_id, health_score, prediction_probability) {
  if (prediction_probability > migration_threshold) {
    candidate_workloads = select_candidate_workloads(partition_id)
    for each workload in candidate_workloads {
      synchronize_data(workload)
      shutdown_workload(workload, partition_id)
      start_workload(workload, destination_partition)
      verify_workload_health(workload, destination_partition)
    }
    update_partition_state(partition_id, "migrating")
  }
}
```

**Scalability & Fault Tolerance:**

*   **Distributed Architecture:** Deploy the DCAM and PMM as a distributed cluster to handle high volumes of data and requests.
*   **Data Replication:** Replicate time-series data and configuration data across multiple nodes for fault tolerance.
*   **Leader Election:** Use a consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft, Paxos) for leader election to ensure a single PMM instance orchestrates migrations.
