## Adaptive Content Prefetching via Predictive User State

**Concept:** Leverage user device sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light, microphone) *in conjunction* with background request analysis to dynamically predict user activity and proactively prefetch content *before* a user explicitly requests it.  This goes beyond simple idle-time prefetching; it aims to anticipate needs based on observed behavior.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Fusion Module:**
    *   Collects data from accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light sensor, and microphone (with appropriate user permissions).
    *   Employs a Kalman filter (or similar sensor fusion algorithm) to smooth and interpret noisy sensor data.
    *   Derives a “User Activity State” score. Possible states: ‘Stationary’, ‘Walking’, ‘Running’, ‘Driving’, ‘Meeting’, ‘Presenting’, ‘Watching (video)’, ‘Listening (audio)’, ‘Idle’.
*   **Predictive Content Mapping:**
    *   Maintains a local database (on the user device) mapping User Activity States to likely content requests. This database is initially seeded with common associations (e.g., ‘Driving’ -> Maps/Navigation, ‘Meeting’ -> Calendar/Presentation materials, 'Watching' -> Streaming video), but *learns* over time via machine learning.
    *   Tracks content consumption patterns (URLs, content types) associated with each User Activity State.
    *   Applies a weighted scoring system. Recent activity has more weight.
*   **Prefetching Engine:**
    *   Monitors User Activity State changes in real-time.
    *   When a new state is detected, consults the Predictive Content Mapping database for high-probability content requests.
    *   Initiates background requests for the predicted content.
    *   Prefetched content is stored in a local, prioritized cache.
*   **Cache Management:**
    *   Prioritizes cached content based on prediction confidence and predicted time of use.
    *   Implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy.
    *   Supports both full-page prefetching and partial prefetching (e.g., prefetching images or scripts).
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:**
    *   Adjusts prefetching aggressiveness based on battery level, network connectivity, and user-defined preferences.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   All sensor data processing happens locally on the device.
    *   User must explicitly opt-in to this feature.
    *   User can view and delete the locally stored content prediction database.
    *   Data anonymization is employed where appropriate.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Engine):**

```
function onSensorDataReceived(sensorData) {
  userActivityState = calculateUserActivityState(sensorData);
  predictedContent = getPredictedContent(userActivityState);

  for each contentItem in predictedContent {
    if (contentItem not in cache) {
      if (batteryLevel > threshold && networkConnected) {
        prefetchContent(contentItem);
      }
    }
  }
}

function prefetchContent(contentItem) {
  // Initiate background request for contentItem
  // Store contentItem in cache with priority based on prediction confidence
}
```

**Novelty:** This extends the concept of background prefetching by incorporating real-time user activity prediction, making it more proactive and adaptive.  It moves beyond simply exploiting idle time to anticipate user needs *before* they are explicitly expressed. The integration of multiple sensor data streams and the learning aspect of the Predictive Content Mapping database add further sophistication.
