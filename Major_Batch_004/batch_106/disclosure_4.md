## Adaptive Aeroelastic Wing Control – Multi-Rotor Integration

**System Overview:** Integrate flexible, aeroelastically tailored wing sections into a multi-rotor platform. These wings aren't for lift (rotors provide that), but for *directed airflow manipulation* during yaw and pitch maneuvers. The wings are composed of a variable stiffness material, actively shaped by micro-actuators, and responsive to rotor thrust differentials.

**Core Innovation:** Instead of twisting the *frame* to induce yaw, actively *shape* airflow around the rotors using adaptive wings, creating asymmetric drag/thrust vectors. This allows for faster, more precise, and potentially energy-efficient yaw control. It’s about changing the ‘felt’ thrust of the rotors, not mechanically counteracting it.

**Specifications:**

*   **Wing Material:** Shape Memory Polymer (SMP) composite reinforced with carbon nanotubes.  SMP allows for pre-programmed deformation based on temperature/electrical stimulus.  Carbon nanotubes provide high strength and electrical conductivity.
*   **Wing Geometry:**  Bi-planar, rectangular wings extending forward from the main body of the multi-rotor.  Span: 0.6 meters. Chord: 0.15 meters. Total wing area: 0.18 m². Wings are segmented into 10 independently controllable sections per wing.
*   **Actuation System:** Piezoelectric micro-actuators embedded within each wing segment. Actuators are arranged in a matrix pattern for precise shape control. Each actuator is controlled by a dedicated driver circuit.
*   **Sensing System:** Array of micro-air pressure sensors embedded within the wing surface.  Sensors measure local airflow velocity and direction.  Data is fed into a control algorithm. IMU data is also utilized for platform state awareness.
*   **Control Algorithm:**
    *   **Input:** Rotor thrust commands, IMU data (orientation, angular velocity), airflow sensor data.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Determine desired yaw/pitch rate.
        2.  Calculate optimal wing shape based on rotor thrust differentials, platform dynamics, and airflow measurements.
        3.  Activate piezoelectric actuators to achieve desired wing shape.
        4.  Continuously monitor airflow and adjust actuator commands for optimal performance.
    *   **Output:** Actuator control signals.
*   **Power System:** Dedicated LiPo battery pack powering actuators and sensors. Voltage: 12V. Capacity: 500mAh.
*   **Communication:** Wireless communication (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) for data logging and remote control.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   Real-time operating system (RTOS) for control loop execution.
    *   Machine learning algorithm for adaptive control and performance optimization (reinforcement learning to fine-tune control parameters).
    *   Graphical user interface (GUI) for monitoring system status and adjusting control parameters.

**Operational Modes:**

1.  **Yaw Assist:**  Wings actively shape airflow to enhance yaw responsiveness.
2.  **Pitch Stabilization:** Wings generate downforce to improve pitch stability during aggressive maneuvers.
3.  **Drag Reduction:** Wings minimize drag during forward flight.
4.  **Emergency Landing:** Wings deploy to increase drag and slow the multi-rotor during an emergency landing.
