## Dynamic Contextual GUI Input Selection – “Aura”

**Concept:** A GUI input selector that isn't static, but *anticipates* user needs based on screen content and recent activity, manifesting as a subtly shifting “aura” around likely input fields.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Technology:**  Image recognition/content analysis combined with predictive AI.
*   **Visual Manifestation:** Instead of a traditional selector (cursor, highlight), a soft, glowing “aura” visually wraps potential input zones.  The aura’s intensity and color shift dynamically.  (Color scheme configurable - default: cyan/light blue for text fields, orange for numeric, green for checkboxes).
*   **Aura Behavior:**
    *   **Static Prediction:**  When the screen is idle, the system analyzes visible elements and pre-highlights likely input fields (e.g., search bars, form fields).  Aura is faint.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** As the user moves the cursor/input device, the aura *shifts* in real-time.  The aura intensity increases around the most probable target field based on cursor proximity and recent input history.
    *   **Multi-Selection:** Multiple fields can be 'aurad' simultaneously, with varying intensities reflecting the probability of selection.
    *   **'Ghost' Input:** When a field is highly probable, a 'ghost' version of the input type (e.g., a flickering keyboard icon over a text field) briefly appears within the aura to reinforce the prediction.
*   **Input Method Agnostic:**  Works with mouse, touchscreen, stylus, voice control.  The aura adapts to the input method.
*   **Customization:**
    *   Aura color, intensity, and animation speed.
    *   Option to disable "ghost" input.
    *   Adjustable prediction sensitivity (how aggressively the system predicts input).
*   **Algorithm Pseudocode:**

    ```
    function predictInput(screenContent, cursorPosition, inputHistory):
      // 1. Analyze screenContent using image recognition to identify input fields (text, numeric, checkboxes, etc.).
      fields = analyzeScreen(screenContent)

      // 2. Calculate probability score for each field based on:
      //    - Field type (e.g., search bar is likely to be used)
      //    - Cursor proximity (closer fields get higher scores)
      //    - Recent input history (fields used recently get higher scores)
      for each field in fields:
        score = calculateScore(field, cursorPosition, inputHistory)
        field.score = score

      // 3. Sort fields by score in descending order
      sortedFields = sortFields(sortedFields)

      // 4. Apply aura to top N fields (configurable)
      for i = 0 to N-1:
        applyAura(sortedFields[i], auraColor, auraIntensity)

    function calculateScore(field, cursorPosition, inputHistory):
      //Basic example - Expand as needed
      score = 0
      score += fieldTypeWeight(field.type) //Search bars get higher weight
      score += distanceWeight(cursorPosition, field.position) //closer = better
      score += historyWeight(field.id, inputHistory) //recently used = better
      return score
    ```

*   **Hardware Considerations:**  Requires sufficient processing power for image analysis and AI prediction.  May benefit from dedicated hardware acceleration.
*   **User Interaction:**  User can optionally 'lock' the aura to a specific field (to prevent it from shifting) using a secondary input (e.g., a key press).
