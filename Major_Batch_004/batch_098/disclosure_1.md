## Temporal Data Weaving - Dynamic Data Provenance & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the dimensional database concept to actively ‘weave’ together temporal slices of data, creating dynamic reconstructions of data states. This goes beyond simple time-slicing by allowing for interactive ‘re-weaving’ of data based on user-defined rules and provenance tracking.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structure Augmentation:**

*   **Provenance Attributes:** Add provenance attributes to *every* data element (fact and dimension table rows). These include:
    *   `OriginTimestamp`: When the data element was first recorded.
    *   `LastModifiedTimestamp`: When the data element was last modified.
    *   `SourceSystem`: The system that originated the data.
    *   `UserContext`: The user/process responsible for the last modification.
    *   `ChangeType`: (Insert, Update, Delete) - reflecting the operation applied.
    *   `PreviousStateHash`: A cryptographic hash of the data element's previous state.
*   **Delta Storage:** Instead of storing complete table states at each time point, store *deltas* (changes) between states. The `PreviousStateHash` is critical for reconstructing complete states.

**2. ‘Weaving Engine’ - Core Logic:**

*   **State Reconstruction:** Given a target time (`TargetTimestamp`), the engine reconstructs the database state by:
    1.  Loading the base state at a prior time (e.g., the last full snapshot).
    2.  Applying all delta records with `OriginTimestamp` or `LastModifiedTimestamp` between the base time and the `TargetTimestamp`.  Use the `PreviousStateHash` to verify data integrity during reconstruction.
*   **Interactive Reweaving:** Allows users to define 'rewriting' rules that modify data states *without* altering the underlying historical data.  These rules operate on the reconstructed state.
    *   **Rule Definition:** Rules are defined using a declarative language (similar to SQL with temporal extensions) and specify conditions and transformations.  Example: “If Sales > 1000 for Product X in Quarter 1 2023, then set Discount to 10%.”
    *   **Rule Application:** The engine applies the rules to the reconstructed state. The original data is untouched; the rewritten state is a new, virtual view.
*   **Provenance Tracking:**  All rewrites are tracked.  Each rewritten data element includes metadata indicating:
    *   The rewriting rule applied.
    *   The user/process that initiated the rewrite.
    *   The time of the rewrite.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Temporal Database Layer:** The core dimensional database with provenance attribute extensions.
*   **Weaving Engine Service:** A standalone service responsible for state reconstruction, rule application, and provenance tracking.  Exposes APIs for data access and manipulation.
*   **Rule Repository:** Stores rewriting rules defined by users.
*   **User Interface:** A visual tool for defining rules, exploring historical data, and viewing rewritten states.

**4. Pseudocode - State Reconstruction**

```pseudocode
function reconstructState(targetTimestamp):
  baseTimestamp = findLatestSnapshotBefore(targetTimestamp)
  baseState = loadState(baseTimestamp)

  deltaRecords = queryDeltaRecords(baseTimestamp, targetTimestamp) // Order by timestamp

  for each deltaRecord in deltaRecords:
    if deltaRecord.ChangeType == "Insert":
      baseState.insert(deltaRecord.data)
    else if deltaRecord.ChangeType == "Update":
      baseState.update(deltaRecord.data)
    else if deltaRecord.ChangeType == "Delete":
      baseState.delete(deltaRecord.data)
  
  return baseState
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Data Auditing & Compliance:**  Easily reconstruct past data states for auditing and compliance purposes.
*   **‘What-If’ Analysis:** Experiment with different scenarios by rewriting historical data.
*   **Data Correction & Enrichment:**  Correct inaccurate data or enrich it with missing information without affecting historical records.
*   **Fraud Detection:** Identify anomalies by comparing rewritten data with historical data.
