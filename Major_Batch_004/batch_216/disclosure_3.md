## Dynamic Domain Sharding with Ephemeral Keys

**Concept:** Enhance the security and scalability of HSM-protected cryptographic material by implementing dynamic domain sharding coupled with ephemeral domain keys. This moves beyond static domain assignments and introduces a system where domains can be created, dissolved, and reassigned on-the-fly, utilizing short-lived domain keys for heightened security.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Fleet Manager:** Centralized component responsible for orchestrating domain creation/destruction, key generation/distribution, and HSM membership management.
*   **HSM Agent:** Software component running on each HSM, responsible for communication with the Fleet Manager, key storage, and cryptographic operations.
*   **Ephemeral Key Generator (EKG):**  A dedicated component (potentially integrated with the Fleet Manager) generating short-lived domain keys. Uses a cryptographically secure random number generator seeded with a master key.
*   **Domain Definition Store:** A secure, replicated store containing the mapping between domain IDs, HSM membership lists, and current ephemeral key IDs.

**2. Key Lifecycle:**

*   **Fleet Key:** Remains the foundational key, replicated across all HSMs, for initial trust and secure communication.
*   **Domain Key Generation:** When a new domain is required, the Fleet Manager instructs the EKG to generate a unique ephemeral domain key. The key's lifespan is configurable (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day).
*   **Domain Membership Assignment:** The Fleet Manager defines the HSMs belonging to the new domain and updates the Domain Definition Store.
*   **Key Distribution:** The ephemeral domain key is encrypted with the Fleet Key and securely distributed to the HSMs assigned to the domain. Each HSM decrypts the key using the Fleet Key.
*   **Key Rotation:** Before expiration, a new ephemeral domain key is generated and distributed *before* the old one expires.  A grace period allows for overlap and smooth transition.
*   **Key Revocation:**  If a domain key is compromised, the Fleet Manager immediately generates a new key and distributes it. The compromised key is marked as revoked in the Domain Definition Store. HSMs will reject operations using revoked keys.

**3. Dynamic Sharding:**

*   **On-Demand Domain Creation:** Applications can request a new domain through the Fleet Manager. The manager assigns HSMs to the domain based on availability, load, and security policies.
*   **Automated Re-Sharding:**  The Fleet Manager periodically re-evaluates domain assignments based on workload changes, HSM failures, or security events. This ensures optimal load balancing and resilience.
*   **Granularity Control:** Domains can be created at different levels of granularity. For example, a domain could represent a specific application, a department, or even a single user.

**4. Cryptographic Operations:**

*   **Data Encryption:** Data is encrypted with a combination of the Fleet Key and the relevant Domain Key. This ensures that only HSMs within the correct domain can decrypt the data.
*   **Secure Communication:** Domain Keys are used to establish secure communication channels between HSMs within the same domain.
*   **Digital Signatures:** Domain Keys can be used to sign data, providing authentication and non-repudiation.

**Pseudocode (HSM Agent â€“ Decryption):**

```
function decryptData(encryptedData, domainId):
  fleetKey = getFleetKey()
  domainKey = getDomainKey(domainId)

  if domainKey == null:
    return error("Domain key not found")

  decryptedWithDomain = decrypt(encryptedData, domainKey)
  decryptedWithFleet = decrypt(decryptedWithDomain, fleetKey)

  return decryptedWithFleet
```

**5.  Extended Features:**

*   **Domain Delegation:** Allow authorized HSMs to delegate domain management responsibilities to other HSMs.
*   **Auditing:** Comprehensive logging of all domain-related operations, including key generation, distribution, and revocation.
*   **Hardware-Based Key Protection:** Store ephemeral domain keys in a secure enclave within the HSM to further enhance security.
