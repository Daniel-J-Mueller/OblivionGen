## Dynamic Signature Weighting for Transaction Risk

**Concept:** Enhance fraud detection by dynamically weighting signature data points based on real-time contextual factors, rather than treating all points equally. This goes beyond simple threshold comparisons to create a more nuanced risk profile.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

*   **Input:** Raw signature data (x, y coordinates, pressure, velocity, timing) from client device.
*   **Preprocessing:** Standard smoothing algorithms applied. Data segmented into 'strokes' â€“ continuous movements of the stylus/finger. Each stroke is assigned a timestamp.
*   **Contextual Data:** Acquire real-time data:
    *   **Device Posture:** Orientation of the client device (portrait/landscape, angle). Accessed via device sensors.
    *   **Network Conditions:** Signal strength, latency.
    *   **Transaction Amount:** Monetary value of the transaction.
    *   **Time of Day/Week:** Influences typical signing behavior.
    *   **User History:** Past transaction behavior, typical signing speed/pressure.

**2. Dynamic Weighting Algorithm:**

*   **Base Weight:** Each signature data point initially assigned a base weight (e.g., 1.0).
*   **Contextual Modifiers:** Apply modifiers based on contextual data:
    *   **Device Posture:**
        *   Significant angle (e.g., >30 degrees): Weight *increased* (signing under awkward conditions).
        *   Unstable orientation (rapid changes): Weight *increased*.
    *   **Network Conditions:**
        *   High latency/weak signal: Weight *increased* (potential for data corruption/manipulation).
    *   **Transaction Amount:**
        *   High value: Weight *increased* for all points.
        *   Unusual amount for the user: Weight *increased*.
    *   **Time of Day/Week:**
        *   Outside typical signing hours: Weight *increased*.
    *   **User History:**
        *   Deviation from typical signing speed/pressure: Weight *increased*.
*   **Stroke Weighting:** Individual strokes weighted based on their duration and completeness. Short, incomplete strokes receive lower weight.
*   **Combined Weight:** Each data point's final weight = Base Weight * (Contextual Modifiers) * (Stroke Weight).

**3. Risk Assessment:**

*   **Signature Profile Creation:** Using weighted data, create a signature profile for each user. This is a multi-dimensional representation of signing dynamics.
*   **Similarity Comparison:** Compare the current signature (weighted profile) to:
    *   Stored signature profile.
    *   Other signatures associated with the same account (if any).
    *   A database of known fraudulent signatures.
*   **Risk Score Calculation:** Assign a risk score based on:
    *   Similarity metrics.
    *   Magnitude of weight adjustments.
    *   Deviation from typical signing behavior.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Client Device:** Captures signature data, transmits to server.
*   **Server:**
    *   Receives data.
    *   Applies weighting algorithm.
    *   Performs risk assessment.
    *   Communicates result to payment facilitator.

**Pseudocode (Weighting Algorithm):**

```
function calculate_weight(data_point, contextual_data):
  base_weight = 1.0
  device_posture_modifier = 1.0
  if device_angle > 30:
    device_posture_modifier = 1.2
  if network_latency > 0.5:
    network_modifier = 1.3
  else:
    network_modifier = 1.0

  transaction_modifier = 1.0
  if transaction_amount > user_average_amount * 2:
    transaction_modifier = 1.1

  final_weight = base_weight * device_posture_modifier * network_modifier * transaction_modifier
  return final_weight
```

This system aims to provide a more granular and adaptive fraud detection mechanism, reducing false positives and improving security.
