## Adaptive Prefetching with Predictive Cache Partitioning

**Concept:** Expand the existing shared memory communication by dynamically predicting receiver agent workload and proactively partitioning the shared memory cache. This goes beyond simply caching/not-caching a message; it *prepares* the cache *before* the message arrives, optimizing for anticipated access patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Shared Memory Controller (SMC):** Enhanced SMC with predictive partitioning capabilities.
*   **Workload Prediction Engine (WPE):** Dedicated hardware or firmware module within the SMC.
*   **Cache Partition Manager (CPM):** Hardware/firmware within SMC to dynamically adjust cache allocation.
*   **Receiver Agent Profiler (RAP):** Software component running on the receiver agent to collect and transmit access pattern data.

**2. Data Structures:**

*   **Access Pattern History (APH):** Per-receiver agent data structure storing timestamps, message IDs, and access locations within the shared memory.
*   **Workload Prediction Model (WPM):** Machine learning model (e.g., RNN, LSTM) trained on APH data. This model predicts future access patterns.
*   **Cache Partition Map (CPM):** Data structure defining how the cache is partitioned. Each partition is assigned to a specific receiver agent.

**3. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Receiver Agent (RAP)
loop:
  record message access (message ID, timestamp, access location)
  periodically transmit APH data to SMC

// Shared Memory Controller (SMC)
init:
  initialize WPM
  initialize CPM (equal partition)

on receive APH data from receiver agent:
  update WPM with received APH data
  predict future access pattern for receiver agent using WPM
  determine optimal cache partition size for receiver agent based on prediction
  adjust CPM to allocate predicted partition size to receiver agent
  //Potential: trigger prefetching of anticipated data based on predicted access pattern

on incoming message for receiver agent:
  write message to shared memory (main memory or cache depending on existing policy)
  //Potential: if prediction indicates high likelihood of immediate access, prioritize placement in pre-allocated cache partition.

```

**4. Refinements:**

*   **Multi-Level Prediction:** Implement hierarchical prediction. Short-term predictions (next few messages) can be based on immediate history, while long-term predictions can be based on broader usage patterns.
*   **Dynamic Partition Granularity:** Allow dynamic adjustment of partition granularity (size and number of partitions).
*   **Adaptive Learning Rate:** Adjust the learning rate of the WPM based on prediction accuracy. If predictions are consistently accurate, decrease the learning rate. If predictions are inaccurate, increase the learning rate.
*    **Cost/Benefit Analysis**: Implement a cost/benefit system regarding dynamic re-partitioning to avoid frequent allocation and deallocation cycles if the benefits do not justify the costs.
*   **Inter-Agent Interference**: Design a mechanism to mitigate interference between agents competing for limited cache resources.
*   **Hardware Acceleration**: Offload computationally intensive tasks (WPM training, access pattern analysis) to dedicated hardware accelerators.
