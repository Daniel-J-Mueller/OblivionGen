## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Layered Content

**Concept:** Extend the 3D layering concept into the haptic domain. Instead of *just* visually representing depth, provide corresponding tactile feedback to the user based on the calculated layer positions. This creates a more immersive and intuitive experience, especially for interfaces with complex hierarchical information or interactive elements.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Ultrasonic Haptic Transducers: Array integrated into device casing (phone, tablet, potentially wearable). These create localized pressure sensations on the skin without physical contact. Density: Minimum 50 transducers per 100cm<sup>2</sup>.
    *   Depth Sensor: High-resolution time-of-flight sensor to map user hand/finger positions relative to the device. Range: 5cm-50cm. Accuracy: <1mm.
    *   Processing Unit: Dedicated co-processor for real-time haptic rendering. Minimum: Quad-core ARM Cortex-A72.
*   **Software:**
    *   Layer Mapping:  The system accesses the node hierarchy established by the visual rendering engine (as described in the provided patent). Each node (and corresponding interface plane) is assigned a ‘haptic intensity’ value (0-100) based on its depth position. Closer layers have higher intensity.
    *   Haptic Rendering Pipeline:
        1.  **Depth Calculation:** Real-time determination of user hand/finger distance from the display.
        2.  **Layer Intersection:** Identify interface planes/nodes ‘under’ the user's hand/finger.
        3.  **Intensity Modulation:** Calculate haptic output based on:
            *   Layer depth (from node hierarchy).
            *   Distance from user hand/finger.
            *   Haptic intensity value of the layer.
        4.  **Transducer Control:**  Individually control each ultrasonic transducer to create localized pressure variations, simulating the texture and depth of the interface elements.
        5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Recalculate haptic output every 10ms to account for hand/finger movement and changes in the node hierarchy (e.g., due to scrolling or animation).
    *   Haptic Profiles:  User-definable profiles to adjust haptic intensity, texture, and feedback characteristics for different applications or content types.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Rendering):**

```
Function RenderHaptics(handPosition, nodeHierarchy):
  For each node in nodeHierarchy:
    distance = CalculateDistance(handPosition, node.position)
    If distance < maxHapticRange:  // e.g., 10cm
      hapticIntensity = node.hapticIntensity * (1 – (distance / maxHapticRange))
      For each transducer in transducerArray:
        If transducer is within proximity of node projection:
          SetTransducerIntensity(transducer, hapticIntensity)
        Else:
          SetTransducerIntensity(transducer, 0)
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond simple vibration or force feedback. It allows for the simulation of complex textures and shapes on the skin, enhancing the sense of immersion and making interfaces more intuitive to interact with. It’s particularly useful for applications like:

*   3D modeling/design
*   Medical imaging
*   Scientific visualization
*   Gaming
*   Accessibility for visually impaired users.
