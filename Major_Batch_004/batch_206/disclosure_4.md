## Data Lineage Anomaly Detection & Predictive Maintenance

**Concept:** Extend the data lineage graph to incorporate anomaly detection and predictive maintenance capabilities for data pipelines. The system will not only track *what* happened to the data but *how well* it happened, predicting potential failures before they occur.

**Specifications:**

**1. Enhanced Graph Nodes:**

*   **Performance Metrics:** Each node representing a transformation will store a time-series of performance metrics beyond simple execution time. Include:
    *   Data Quality Scores (e.g., completeness, accuracy, consistency)
    *   Resource Utilization (CPU, Memory, I/O)
    *   Error Rates
    *   Data Volume Processed
*   **Baseline Establishment:** The system automatically establishes baselines for each metric based on historical data. Baselines are updated dynamically using moving averages and statistical methods.
*   **Anomaly Scoring:** Implement an anomaly scoring algorithm (e.g., Z-score, Isolation Forest, autoencoders) to identify deviations from the baseline. Score is stored as a node property.

**2.  Predictive Failure Modeling:**

*   **Correlation Analysis:** Periodically analyze correlations between performance metrics across different nodes. Identify patterns indicating potential cascading failures.
*   **Failure Prediction Model:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict the probability of failure for each node based on current and historical performance data, correlated metrics, and anomaly scores.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Aggregate risk scores across the data flow graph to assess the overall health of the pipeline.

**3.  Alerting & Remediation:**

*   **Threshold-Based Alerts:** Configure alerts based on anomaly scores, risk scores, or predicted failure probabilities.
*   **Automated Remediation:** Integrate with pipeline orchestration tools to trigger automated remediation actions, such as:
    *   Restarting failed transformations
    *   Scaling resources
    *   Rerouting data
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Leverage the data lineage graph to trace anomalies back to their root cause.

**4.  Implementation Details (Pseudocode):**

```
// Node class (extended)
class DataNode {
    // Existing properties (transformation, data, etc.)
    TimeSeries<PerformanceMetric> performanceMetrics;
    double anomalyScore;
    double predictedFailureProbability;
}

// Anomaly Detection Function
function detectAnomaly(DataNode node) {
    // Calculate Z-score or use other anomaly detection algorithm
    node.anomalyScore = calculateZScore(node.performanceMetrics);
    return node.anomalyScore;
}

// Failure Prediction Function
function predictFailure(DataNode node) {
    // Train ML model using historical data
    // Input: node.performanceMetrics, correlated metrics
    // Output: node.predictedFailureProbability
    node.predictedFailureProbability = mlModel.predict(node);
    return node.predictedFailureProbability;
}

// Risk Assessment Function
function assessRisk(DataFlowGraph graph) {
    totalRisk = 0;
    for each node in graph {
        totalRisk += node.predictedFailureProbability;
    }
    return totalRisk;
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    for each node in graph {
        detectAnomaly(node);
        predictFailure(node);
    }
    risk = assessRisk(graph);
    if (risk > threshold) {
        triggerAlerts();
        initiateRemediation();
    }
    sleep(interval);
}
```

**5. Data Storage:**

*   Time-series data should be stored in a specialized time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus) for efficient querying and analysis.
*   The data lineage graph itself can be stored in a graph database (e.g., Neo4j).
