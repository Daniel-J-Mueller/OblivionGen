**Dynamic Attribute Weighting & Multi-Modal Fusion**

**Concept:** Extend the data quality scoring to incorporate not just textual similarity, but also image/video similarity and user interaction data (views, purchases, returns) to dynamically weight attribute importance. This enables a more holistic and adaptive quality assessment.

**Specs:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Data Ingestion:**
    *   Accept submissions including: Textual description, associated image/video URL, Merchant ID.
    *   Image/Video processing pipeline utilizing pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction. Features stored as vectors.

2.  **Attribute Importance Mapping:**
    *   Maintain a dynamic attribute importance table per product category. Initial weights assigned based on expert knowledge or historical data.
    *   Update weights based on user interaction data.  Higher views, purchases, lower returns = higher weight.  Algorithm:
        ```
        Weight_New = Weight_Old + Learning_Rate * (Interaction_Score - Expected_Interaction_Score)
        ```
        *   `Interaction_Score`: Calculated from views, purchases, returns over a defined period.
        *   `Expected_Interaction_Score`:  Average interaction score for similar attributes within the product category.
        *   `Learning_Rate`: Adjustable parameter controlling the speed of adaptation.

3.  **Data Quality Scoring - Extended:**
    *   **Textual Similarity:** As in the base patent.
    *   **Visual Similarity:** Calculate cosine similarity between image/video feature vectors.
    *   **Combined Score:** Weighted average of textual, visual, and user interaction scores.
        ```
        Data_Quality_Score = (Weight_Textual * Textual_Similarity) + (Weight_Visual * Visual_Similarity) + (Weight_Interaction * Interaction_Score)
        ```
        *   Weights are dynamically adjusted based on the attribute importance mapping and potentially product category.

4.  **Merchant Rating - Enhanced:**
    *   Cumulative quality score calculation incorporates the dynamic weights.
    *   Implement a decay mechanism for older submissions to prioritize recent performance.
    *   Anomaly detection: Flag merchants with sudden drops in quality scores.

5.  **API Endpoints:**
    *   Submission endpoint: Accepts textual descriptions, images/videos, and merchant IDs.
    *   Rating endpoint: Returns merchant rating based on cumulative score.
    *   Attribute importance endpoint: Returns current attribute weights for a given product category.

6.  **Data Storage:**
    *   Time-series database for storing historical interaction data and quality scores.
    *   Vector database for storing image/video feature vectors.
    *   Relational database for storing product category information and attribute mappings.
