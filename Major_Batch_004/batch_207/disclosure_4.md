## Adaptive Camouflage Smart Plug

**Concept:** A smart plug incorporating micro-e-ink or similar flexible display technology to visually blend with surrounding wall colors and textures. Beyond aesthetics, this allows for functional signaling – subtly indicating power state (on/off, standby) or even acting as a localized notification system.

**Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** Maintains general smart plug dimensions (approx. 2”x1.5”x1”). Housing constructed of matte white or light grey recyclable plastic.
*   **Display:** Full surface coverage with a flexible, low-power e-ink or electrophoretic display. Resolution: 160x120 pixels minimum. Color Palette: Capable of displaying a range of muted pastel shades, grayscale, and patterns.
*   **Color/Pattern Acquisition:**
    *   Integrated ambient light sensor to analyze wall color.
    *   User-configurable color selection via mobile app (RGB/HEX input).
    *   “Learn” mode: User points phone camera at wall; app analyzes dominant color and applies it to the plug’s display.
    *   Pre-programmed texture patterns (wood grain, brick, etc.) selectable in the app.
*   **Functional Signaling:**
    *   Power On: Subtle pulsating glow of the selected wall color.
    *   Power Off: Display mimics the wall color, effectively 'disappearing.'
    *   Standby: Static, dimmed version of wall color.
    *   Notifications: Customizable color/pattern flashes for alerts (e.g., red flash for high energy consumption).
*   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n), Bluetooth 5.0.
*   **Power:** Standard AC plug interface. Max load: 15A, 1800W.
*   **Software:** Mobile app (iOS & Android) for setup, color/pattern selection, notification customization, and energy monitoring.

**Pseudocode (Notification Logic):**

```
function handle_notification(notification_type, data):
  if notification_type == "high_energy":
    set_display_pattern("pulsating_red")
    duration = 5 seconds
  elif notification_type == "device_online":
    set_display_pattern("soft_blue_glow")
    duration = 2 seconds
  elif notification_type == "custom_alert":
    color = data["color"]
    pattern = data["pattern"]
    set_display_color(color)
    set_display_pattern(pattern)
    duration = data["duration"]
  else:
    set_display_color(wall_color) //Return to wall color
  
  set_timer(duration, reset_to_wall_color)

function reset_to_wall_color():
  set_display_color(wall_color)
```

**Refinement Considerations:**

*   Explore using conductive inks for integrated touch controls on the display surface.
*   Implement a miniature camera for more accurate wall color/texture matching.
*   Investigate incorporating haptic feedback to confirm user input.
*   Consider different display technologies beyond e-ink (e.g., micro-LED, flexible OLED) based on cost/performance tradeoffs.
