## Dynamic Predictive Bundling & Micro-Incentivization

**Concept:** Leverage click value & purchase history not just for ad selection, but to *proactively* bundle items a visitor is likely to purchase *together*, presented as a limited-time offer, and dynamically adjust micro-incentives (e.g., small percentage discounts, free shipping on the bundle) based on real-time responsiveness.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Predictive Bundling Engine (PBE)
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   User Click Value (from existing system).
    *   User Purchase History (from existing system).
    *   Browsing History (from existing system).
    *   Real-time Session Data (items viewed, time spent on pages, mouse movements).
    *   Item Affinity Matrix (calculated based on co-purchases across *all* users).
    *   Inventory Levels (real-time stock counts for each item).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Affinity Score Calculation:** PBE calculates an affinity score for each item based on the user's history, current session data, and the item affinity matrix.
    2.  **Bundle Generation:** The engine generates several potential bundles (2-5 items) with the highest aggregate affinity scores. Bundles are constrained by inventory.
    3.  **Dynamic Incentive Assignment:**
        *   Initial Incentive: A baseline incentive is assigned based on the user's click value. Higher click value = lower initial incentive (we assume higher propensity to purchase anyway).
        *   Responsiveness Tracking: PBE monitors the userâ€™s interaction with the bundle offer:
            *   Time spent viewing the offer.
            *   Mouseover events on individual items in the bundle.
            *   Clicks on "learn more" links for specific items.
        *   Incentive Adjustment: Based on responsiveness, the incentive is *dynamically* adjusted. Low responsiveness = increased incentive (e.g., increased discount percentage). High responsiveness = potentially decreased incentive (or maintaining the current incentive).  Adjustment happens in near real-time (every 5-10 seconds).
    4.  **Offer Presentation:**  The generated bundle with the dynamically adjusted incentive is presented to the user.  Presentation includes a visual countdown timer emphasizing limited-time availability.

*   **Pseudocode (Incentive Adjustment):**

```pseudocode
function adjustIncentive(user, bundle, responsivenessScore) {
  baseIncentive = calculateBaseIncentive(user.clickValue);
  
  if (responsivenessScore < 30) { // Low responsiveness
    adjustedIncentive = baseIncentive + 5%; // Increase incentive
  } else if (responsivenessScore >= 30 && responsivenessScore < 70) { // Moderate responsiveness
    adjustedIncentive = baseIncentive; // Maintain incentive
  } else { // High responsiveness
    adjustedIncentive = baseIncentive - 2%; // Decrease incentive (cautiously)
  }

  return adjustedIncentive;
}

function calculateResponsivenessScore(userSessionData) {
    // Logic to combine time spent viewing offer, mouseover events, and clicks
    // Weighted sum or more complex algorithm to quantify user engagement
    // Example: (timeSpentViewing * 0.5) + (mouseoverCount * 0.3) + (clickCount * 0.2)
    // Normalize the score to a range of 0-100
}
```

*   **Data Storage:**
    *   User Responsiveness History: Store the responsiveness score and the corresponding incentive offered for each user and bundle. This data is used for machine learning to optimize the incentive adjustment algorithm.
*   **Integration Points:**
    *   Click Value System (existing).
    *   Ad Server (existing).
    *   Inventory Management System.
    *   User Session Tracking System.
