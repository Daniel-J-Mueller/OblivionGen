**Secure Storage ‘Ghosting’ – Dynamic Data Fragmentation & Relocation**

**Concept:** Expand on the secure erasure concepts by dynamically fragmenting and relocating data across the storage medium *during* normal operation, making reconstruction even after physical access exceedingly difficult. This isn’t about *erasing* data, but making it functionally inaccessible without the correct ‘reassembly key’.

**Specifications:**

*   **Fragmentation Algorithm:** A pseudo-random, but deterministic, fragmentation algorithm. The algorithm will divide data blocks into variable-sized fragments. Seed data will be derived from a master encryption key + a timestamp.
*   **Relocation Mapping:** A secure mapping table detailing fragment locations. This table itself will be encrypted and stored in a separate, highly secure region of the storage medium. Redundancy will be built in; multiple copies of the mapping table will exist, but scrambled using different keys derived from the master.
*   **Write Operation Modification:** Any write operation will be intercepted by a dedicated firmware module. This module will:
    1.  Encrypt the data using the master key.
    2.  Fragment the encrypted data.
    3.  Relocate fragments to available blocks on the storage medium.
    4.  Update the relocation mapping table.
*   **Read Operation Modification:** Any read operation will be intercepted. The module will:
    1.  Consult the relocation mapping table to locate fragments.
    2.  Retrieve fragments.
    3.  Reassemble fragments.
    4.  Decrypt the reassembled data.
*   **Secure Boot Integration:** The secure boot process will verify the integrity of the fragmentation/relocation module *and* the relocation mapping table encryption key.
*   **‘Ghost Mode’ Activation:** A command (only authorized during boot/initialization via trusted firmware) will toggle between ‘Normal Mode’ (standard operation) and ‘Ghost Mode’ (fragmentation/relocation active). In Ghost Mode, the storage device *appears* full, as all available space is occupied by fragments, even if logically the storage isn’t near capacity.
*   **Dynamic Fragmentation Level:** Adjust the fragment size dynamically based on storage usage and performance. Smaller fragments increase security, larger fragments improve performance. The algorithm will self-optimize based on workload.
*   **Tamper Detection:** Hardware and software tamper detection mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modification of the fragmentation/relocation module or the relocation mapping table.

**Pseudocode (Write Operation):**

```
function writeData(data, address):
  key =getMasterEncryptionKey()
  encryptedData = encrypt(data, key)
  fragments = fragment(encryptedData)
  
  for each fragment in fragments:
    location = findAvailableBlock()
    writeFragment(fragment, location)
    updateMappingTable(fragment, location)

  return success
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Dedicated encryption/decryption engine.
*   Fast, secure flash memory for the relocation mapping table.
*   Tamper-resistant hardware security module (HSM).

**Novelty:**

This system differs from standard encryption and secure erasure by *actively* concealing data in a dynamic manner. It goes beyond simply overwriting or encrypting; it makes the data difficult to find *even if* the encryption is broken, because the fragments are scattered across the disk. The ‘Ghost Mode’ effectively creates a ‘data illusion’ where the storage appears to be filled with random data.
