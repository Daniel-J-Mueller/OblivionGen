## Modular Void-Forming Insert System with Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** A packaging insert system utilizing interlocking, geometrically variable modules to create a highly customizable void for securing electronics. The system incorporates small, integrated haptic actuators within the modules to provide feedback during the void-formation process and confirm secure device placement.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Geometry:** Each module is a truncated tetrahedron, approximately 2cm per side. Faces are semi-flexible, constructed from a layered composite of recycled PET and a thin layer of shape-memory polymer.
*   **Interlocking Mechanism:** Each module face incorporates a series of micro-hooks and loops, arranged in a directional pattern.  Alignment and pressure allow for secure interlocking along any adjacent face. Modules are designed to be disassembled with minimal force.
*   **Haptic Actuators:** Each module contains one or more miniature vibration motors (precision eccentric rotating mass - PERM) controlled by a localized microcontroller. These actuate based on internal pressure sensors.
*   **Pressure Sensors:** Piezoelectric sensors embedded within each module face detect pressure applied during module assembly and device insertion. Thresholds trigger haptic feedback.
*   **Microcontroller & Communication:** Each module contains a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) microcontroller enabling communication with a central “Void Configuration Unit” (VCU).
*   **VCU Software:** Software analyzes device dimensions entered by the user. It then generates an optimal module configuration & communicates the arrangement to each module. The VCU uses a genetic algorithm to refine configuration over time.
*   **Assembly Sequence:** Software guides the user through the module assembly process, providing visual cues and real-time haptic feedback indicating correct alignment.
*   **Void Adjustment:** The software enables fine-tuning of the void based on real-time pressure sensor data and user input.
*   **Material:** Recycled PET core with PLA outer shell. Modules will be compostable.
*   **Power:** Each module powered by a tiny, rechargeable solid-state battery. Wireless charging enabled via inductive coupling during insertion into the VCU.

**Pseudocode (Module Control):**

```
FUNCTION InitializeModule()
    Enable BLE
    Connect to VCU
    Calibrate Pressure Sensors
    Activate Battery Charging Circuit

FUNCTION ReceiveConfiguration(configurationData)
    Parse configurationData to determine module position and void size
    Adjust shape-memory polymer based on void size parameters.

FUNCTION MonitorPressure()
    Read pressure sensor values from all faces
    IF pressure exceeds threshold:
        Activate haptic actuator
        Transmit pressure data to VCU
        Adjust shape memory polymer to provide more support
    ENDIF

FUNCTION CommunicateStatus()
    Transmit module status (pressure, battery level, position) to VCU
```

**Innovation Rationale:**

This moves beyond static, pre-defined voids.  The modularity allows for adaptation to a *vast* range of device sizes and shapes.  The haptic feedback provides confirmation of secure device placement and acts as a quality control mechanism. It reduces the need for custom foam inserts, significantly reducing material waste and associated costs. This system is scalable and could be adapted for use in a wide variety of packaging applications. The compostable material offers a sustainable alternative to traditional plastic packaging.
