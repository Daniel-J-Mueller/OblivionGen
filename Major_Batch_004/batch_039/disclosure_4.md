## Dynamic Code Completion with Contextual Graph Traversal

**Concept:** Extend the existing name suggestion system to leverage a dynamic contextual graph representing code relationships *beyond* the abstract syntax tree. This graph would be constructed on-the-fly, incorporating data flow, control flow, and semantic relationships gleaned from code analysis, enabling suggestions that anticipate *intended* functionality rather than just lexical similarity.

**Specs:**

*   **Contextual Graph Construction:**
    *   Input: Plurality of source code files.
    *   Process:
        *   AST Generation: As in the existing system.
        *   Data Flow Analysis: Identify variable assignments, function calls, and data dependencies.
        *   Control Flow Analysis: Construct a control flow graph to represent execution paths.
        *   Semantic Relationship Extraction: Utilize static analysis and potentially lightweight symbolic execution to infer semantic relationships (e.g., "this variable is used as a counter," "this function calculates a total").
        *   Graph Creation: Combine AST nodes, data flow edges, control flow edges, and semantic relationships into a single, directed graph.  Node types: `Variable`, `Function`, `Statement`, `Expression`, `SemanticConcept`. Edge types: `DataFlow`, `ControlFlow`, `Calls`, `Uses`, `IsA`.
*   **Suggestion Generation:**
    *   Input: Current code context (e.g., cursor position, surrounding code).
    *   Process:
        *   Anchor Node Identification: Determine the AST node (and corresponding graph node) representing the current code context.
        *   Graph Traversal: Perform a breadth-first or depth-first search from the anchor node, guided by a scoring function.
        *   Scoring Function:  This is key.  It should combine:
            *   Node Type Weight:  Prioritize certain node types (e.g., function names over variable names).
            *   Path Length Penalty:  Penalize long paths.
            *   Semantic Similarity:  Compare the semantic tags associated with nodes to the surrounding code.  Use word embeddings or knowledge graphs to measure similarity.
            *   Usage Frequency: Boost nodes that are frequently used in similar contexts.
        *   Suggestion Filtering:  Remove suggestions that are syntactically invalid or lexically dissimilar.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   Graph Database:  Use a graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) to efficiently store and query the contextual graph.
    *   Embedding Generation: Utilize pre-trained language models (BERT, CodeBERT) to generate embeddings for code elements and semantic concepts.
    *   Caching: Cache frequently accessed portions of the graph to improve performance.
    *   Incremental Updates: Implement a mechanism for incrementally updating the graph as code changes are made.

**Pseudocode (Suggestion Generation):**

```
function generate_suggestions(context, graph_db, embedding_model):
  anchor_node = find_anchor_node(context, graph_db)
  visited_nodes = set()
  suggestion_candidates = []

  queue = [anchor_node]
  visited_nodes.add(anchor_node)

  while queue is not empty:
    current_node = queue.pop(0)
    suggestion_candidates.append(current_node)

    for neighbor in get_neighbors(current_node, graph_db):
      if neighbor not in visited_nodes:
        visited_nodes.add(neighbor)
        queue.append(neighbor)

  scored_candidates = score_candidates(suggestion_candidates, context, embedding_model)
  filtered_candidates = filter_candidates(scored_candidates, context)
  sorted_candidates = sort_candidates(filtered_candidates)

  return sorted_candidates
```

This system anticipates the developer's intent through a dynamic contextual graph.  Instead of only looking at name similarities it considers the *role* of the code element and its connections to the surrounding context. It will require more computational power, but will be able to provide more valuable code completion suggestions.
