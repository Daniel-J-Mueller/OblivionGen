## Dynamic Resource Morphing

**Concept:** Extend the template-based update system with the ability to *morph* resources – changing their inherent type during an update – based on runtime conditions and template directives. This goes beyond simple parameter adjustments to fundamentally alter what a resource *is*.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Morph Definitions in Templates:** Templates will include “morph” sections alongside standard resource definitions. These sections specify:
    *   `source_type`: The current resource type.
    *   `target_type`: The desired resource type after morphing.
    *   `morph_condition`: A boolean expression evaluated at runtime.  This could leverage metrics, external services, or other resource states. (e.g., `if (CPU_USAGE > 80%) then morph to "high_memory_instance"`)
    *   `data_migration_strategy`: Instructions on how to migrate data/state from the `source_type` to the `target_type`. Options: ‘automatic’, ‘manual’, ‘discard’. ‘Automatic’ implies a pre-defined conversion process. ‘Manual’ would require user intervention, pausing the update. ‘Discard’ drops data.
    *   `compatibility_override`: Flags to bypass certain dependency checks if morphing necessitates breaking changes. (Use with extreme caution).

2.  **Morph Engine:** A new component within the update system responsible for:
    *   Evaluating `morph_condition` for each resource.
    *   Orchestrating resource transformation when conditions are met.
    *   Managing data migration according to `data_migration_strategy`.
    *   Handling potential errors during morphing (rollback, logging).

3.  **Resource Type Registry:** Maintain a comprehensive registry of all supported resource types with associated:
    *   Data schema definitions.
    *   Migration scripts for transitions between types.
    *   Compatibility rules.

4.  **Runtime Monitoring Integration:** Integrate with runtime monitoring systems to:
    *   Expose resource metrics used in `morph_condition`.
    *   Track morphing operations in real-time.
    *   Alert operators of failures or unexpected behavior.

**Pseudocode (Morph Engine Core):**

```
function perform_morph(resource, template):
  if template.morph_section_exists(resource):
    condition = template.get_morph_condition(resource)
    if evaluate_condition(condition):
      source_type = template.get_source_type(resource)
      target_type = template.get_target_type(resource)
      migration_strategy = template.get_migration_strategy(resource)

      # 1. Create new resource of target_type
      new_resource = create_resource(target_type)

      # 2. Migrate data based on strategy
      if migration_strategy == "automatic":
        migrate_data(source_type, target_type, resource, new_resource)
      else if migration_strategy == "manual":
        pause_update()
        prompt_operator(resource, new_resource)
        resume_update()
      else if migration_strategy == "discard":
        # Data loss warning
        pass

      # 3. Replace old resource with new resource
      replace_resource(resource, new_resource)

      # 4. Cleanup old resource
      destroy_resource(resource)
  else:
    # Normal update process
    update_resource(resource, template)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Auto-scaling based on application behavior:** Morph a resource from a low-cost instance to a high-performance one when specific metrics exceed thresholds.
*   **Database schema evolution:** Morph a database instance to a new schema version during an update.
*   **Security patching:** Morph a vulnerable resource to a patched version seamlessly.
*   **Dynamic tiering:** Morph resources between different tiers (e.g., development, staging, production) based on defined rules.
