## Multi-User Spatial Anchoring with Dynamic Object Roles

**Concept:** Expand the hand/camera tracking beyond simple data transfer to enable collaborative spatial computing experiences where virtual objects are dynamically assigned roles and manipulated by multiple users simultaneously, anchored to the physical environment. This moves beyond individual device interaction to shared AR/VR experiences.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Minimum: Two devices with outward-facing cameras (smartphones, tablets, AR glasses) capable of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).
    *   Recommended: Dedicated AR/VR headsets with higher-fidelity tracking and rendering capabilities.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **Spatial Mapping Module:** Utilizes SLAM algorithms to create a shared 3D map of the physical environment visible to all participating devices.  Keyframe based approach with continuous refinement.
    *   **Hand/Gesture Tracking Module:**  Improved hand tracking with finer-grained gesture recognition (beyond pinching/unpinching). Includes individual finger tracking and prediction.
    *   **Object Role Assignment Module:**  Defines virtual object "roles" (e.g., "rotate," "scale," "move," "activate").  These roles are assigned dynamically based on user proximity, hand gestures, and object state.  Role assignments are broadcast to all participating devices.
    *   **Collision Detection and Physics Engine:** Simulates realistic physics interactions between virtual objects and the environment (and potentially, virtual interactions between users).
    *   **Communication Protocol:** Low-latency, secure communication protocol (UDP multicast preferred) for broadcasting spatial data, hand tracking information, and role assignments.
    *   **User Interface:** Minimalist UI for managing connections and object role assignments (optional).
*   **Operational Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
//Device 1 (initiator)
createSpatialMap()
broadcastSpatialMap() //to all connected devices
createVirtualObject(objectType, position, scale)
assignInitialRole(object, user1, "rotate")

//Device 2+ (joining devices)
receiveSpatialMap()
reconstructSpatialEnvironment()
receiveObjectUpdates()
receiveRoleAssignments()

//Shared Loop (All Devices)
while(connected){
    trackHandPosition(user)
    detectGesture(user)

    if(gesture == "grab" && object in range){
        requestRole(object, "move")
    }
    if(role == "move"){
        calculateObjectOffset(handPosition)
        sendObjectUpdate(object, newPosition)
    }
    if(gesture == "release"){
        revokeRole(object)
    }
}
```

*   **Dynamic Role Assignment Logic:**

    *   Proximity-based: The user closest to the object automatically receives the “primary” manipulation role.
    *   Gesture-based: Specific gestures can request temporary roles (e.g., a “push” gesture requests the “move” role).
    *   Conflict Resolution: If multiple users request the same role, a priority system (based on proximity or user preference) determines who receives it.  A visual indicator (e.g., a highlighting effect) shows which user has control.
*   **Scalability:**  System designed to support a large number of concurrent users (up to 10+). Use of efficient data compression and broadcasting techniques to minimize network bandwidth usage.
*   **Application Scenarios:** Collaborative design reviews, remote assistance, shared gaming experiences, interactive training simulations, and augmented reality-based collaboration.
