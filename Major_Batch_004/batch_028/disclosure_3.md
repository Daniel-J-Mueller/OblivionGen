## Adaptive Contextual Embedding with Dynamic Granularity

**System Specifications:**

**Core Concept:**  A word embedding system that adjusts the granularity of contextual information incorporated into the embedding vector *dynamically*, based on the confidence score of the input token *and* a user-defined "context sensitivity" profile.  This allows for highly nuanced representation of words, reducing ambiguity and improving downstream task performance.

**Modules:**

1.  **Input Processing & Confidence Scoring:** (Similar to existing patent, but extended). Receives audio data, performs ASR, generates text, and assigns a confidence score per token.  *Crucially*, includes a ‘hesitation detection’ module – identifies pauses/umms/ahs – and flags potentially lower-confidence segments.

2.  **User Context Profile:**  A user-configurable profile stored per user.  This profile contains:
    *   **Context Sensitivity Level:** (Low/Medium/High/Max) –  Determines the baseline amount of contextual information to include.  (See Module 4 for how this is implemented)
    *   **Domain Preferences:**  A list of preferred domains (e.g., "music", "sports", "technology").
    *   **Noise Tolerance:**  Indicates the user's preference for filtering out less relevant contextual data.

3.  **Context Extraction & Scoring:**  This is where the innovation lies.  Instead of simply appending fixed context vectors, this module dynamically selects *which* context to include and *how much*.  It analyzes several layers of context:
    *   **Local Context:**  ( +/- *n* tokens) – Standard n-gram analysis.
    *   **Semantic Context:**  Utilizes a knowledge graph (e.g., Wikidata, ConceptNet) to identify related concepts and entities.
    *   **User Context:**  (From User Context Profile) -  Relevant domain information, recent interactions, etc.
    *   **Temporal Context:**  Time of day, day of week, recent events (if available through user permissions).

    Each contextual element is assigned a 'relevance score' based on:
    *   Its semantic distance to the target token.
    *   Its relevance to the User Context Profile.
    *   Its temporal proximity to the token.

4.  **Dynamic Embedding Generation:** This module merges the token’s base embedding with the selected contextual information. It operates according to the confidence score and context sensitivity level:

    ```pseudocode
    function generate_embedding(token, base_embedding, context_data, confidence_score, context_sensitivity):
        # Normalize confidence score to range [0, 1]
        normalized_confidence = confidence_score / 100.0

        # Determine context inclusion threshold based on sensitivity
        if context_sensitivity == "Low":
            inclusion_threshold = 0.2
        elif context_sensitivity == "Medium":
            inclusion_threshold = 0.5
        elif context_sensitivity == "High":
            inclusion_threshold = 0.8
        else: # "Max"
            inclusion_threshold = 1.0

        # Filter context data based on relevance score and threshold
        filtered_context = []
        for context_item in context_data:
            if context_item.relevance_score >= inclusion_threshold:
                filtered_context.append(context_item)

        # Weight contextual embeddings based on relevance score AND confidence score
        weighted_context_embeddings = []
        for context_item in filtered_context:
            weight = context_item.relevance_score * normalized_confidence
            weighted_context_embeddings.append(context_item.embedding * weight)

        # Combine base embedding with weighted contextual embeddings
        final_embedding = base_embedding + sum(weighted_context_embeddings)

        return final_embedding
    ```

5.  **Hesitation Handling:**  If a token is flagged as part of a hesitation (from the Input Processing module), a “hesitation vector” is appended to the embedding. This vector signals uncertainty and can be used to trigger further processing (e.g., requesting clarification).



**Data Requirements:**

*   Large language model for generating base embeddings.
*   Knowledge graph (Wikidata, ConceptNet, or custom).
*   User context profiles.
*   Extensive training data with labeled hesitations.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Improved speech recognition accuracy, especially in noisy environments.
*   More natural and nuanced conversational AI.
*   Better understanding of user intent.
*   Enhanced information retrieval.
