## Proximity-Based Collaborative Task Assignment

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A networked system integrating location data (GPS, Bluetooth beacons, WiFi triangulation) with a task management platform.
*   **User Profiles:** Users define skillsets, availability windows, and preferred task types.
*   **Task Creation:** Tasks are defined with location requirements (e.g., “Need help moving a heavy object at coordinates X,Y”), skill requirements (e.g., “Requires strength and basic tool knowledge”), and time sensitivity.
*   **Proximity Engine:** Continuously scans for users within a configurable radius of active tasks.
*   **Skill Matching:** Algorithms prioritize users matching task skill requirements.
*   **Availability Check:** Confirms user availability within the task timeframe.
*   **Automated Bidding/Assignment:** System automatically proposes tasks to eligible users, or initiates a micro-bidding system where users can express interest and propose a time/reward.
*   **Dynamic Reward System:** Rewards can be points, virtual currency, or real-world payment integration. Reward scales with task complexity, urgency, and user skill level.
*   **Reputation System:**  Users earn reputation points based on task completion quality and timeliness. This influences task assignment priority.
*   **Safety Features:**  Built-in reporting mechanisms for safety concerns, optional background checks for certain task categories, and location sharing with trusted contacts.
*   **Augmented Reality Interface:**  AR overlays on mobile devices display nearby tasks with relevant information (description, reward, required skills) and navigation assistance.

**Innovation Description:**

This system moves beyond simple location-based notifications. It transforms proximity into a dynamic task-assignment network.  Imagine a scenario: a user needs help assembling furniture. The system identifies nearby users with relevant skills (DIY, carpentry), checks their availability, and automatically proposes the task.  The helper can accept, negotiate, and complete the task, earning a reward.  This creates a hyperlocal, on-demand support network. This could extend to disaster relief, community assistance, or even ad-hoc repair services.

**Pseudocode (Task Assignment Engine):**

```
FUNCTION assignTask(task) {
  location = task.location
  radius = task.radius
  skills = task.skills

  nearbyUsers = getUsersWithinRadius(location, radius)

  eligibleUsers = []
  FOR EACH user IN nearbyUsers {
    IF user.hasSkills(skills) AND user.isAvailable(task.timeframe) {
      eligibleUsers.append(user)
    }
  }

  IF eligibleUsers.length > 0 {
    bestUser = selectBestUser(eligibleUsers) // Based on reputation, skill level, etc.
    proposeTask(bestUser, task)
  } ELSE {
    increaseRadius(task) // Expand search area
    assignTask(task) // Recursive call
  }
}

FUNCTION proposeTask(user, task) {
  // Send notification to user with task details
  // User accepts or rejects task
  IF user.acceptsTask(task) {
    task.assignTo(user)
  } ELSE {
    // Find next best user
  }
}
