## Virtual Network ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Failure Analysis

**Specification:** Implement a system that creates a dynamic, read-only ‘shadow’ virtual network mirroring a production client network. This shadow network isn’t for traffic, but for proactive analysis and prediction of potential failures *before* they impact the client.

**Components:**

*   **Mirroring Agent:** Deployed alongside the existing virtual network verification service. Intercepts network configuration changes (VM creation, security group modifications, routing table updates) and replicates them to the shadow network.  *No actual traffic* is mirrored, only configuration data.
*   **Constraint Solver Integration:** The existing constraint solver engine is leveraged to continually run a suite of ‘what-if’ scenarios on the shadow network. These scenarios include:
    *   **Simulated Outages:**  Individual VM failures, link failures, security group blocks, etc., are simulated and the constraint solver determines the impact on network connectivity and application availability.
    *   **Security Vulnerability Injection:**  Simulate exploitation of known vulnerabilities to assess the blast radius and potential data breaches.
    *   **Performance Bottleneck Analysis:** Model increased traffic load to identify potential performance bottlenecks in the shadow network.
*   **Predictive Alerting System:** Based on the results of the constraint solver, a predictive alerting system generates alerts *before* issues manifest in the production environment. These alerts provide specific recommendations for remediation.  (e.g., "Simulated failure of VM-A will disrupt application X. Recommend creating a hot standby VM.")
*   **Historical Baseline & Anomaly Detection:**  Store the historical configuration state of the shadow network. Implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify deviations from the baseline that may indicate potential issues.
* **Automated Remediation Trigger (Optional):**  Allow clients to configure automated remediation actions to be triggered based on alerts (e.g., automatically scale up resources, reroute traffic).

**Pseudocode (Alerting System):**

```
function analyze_shadow_network(shadow_network_config, constraint_solver):
  // Run a suite of ‘what-if’ scenarios
  outage_impact = simulate_outage(shadow_network_config, constraint_solver)
  security_impact = simulate_security_breach(shadow_network_config, constraint_solver)
  performance_bottlenecks = analyze_performance(shadow_network_config, constraint_solver)

  alerts = []

  //Generate alerts based on simulation results
  if outage_impact.critical_services_disrupted:
    alerts.append("CRITICAL: Simulated outage will disrupt service X.  Recommend Y.")
  if security_impact.data_breach_potential:
    alerts.append("SECURITY ALERT: Simulated breach detected.  Risk to data Z.")
  if performance_bottlenecks.slow_response_times:
    alerts.append("PERFORMANCE WARNING:  Potential performance bottlenecks detected.")

  return alerts

function main():
  shadow_network_config = get_shadow_network_configuration()
  alerts = analyze_shadow_network(shadow_network_config, constraint_solver)

  for alert in alerts:
    send_alert(alert)

```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ShadowNetworkConfiguration`:  A representation of the client's virtual network configuration (VMs, security groups, routing tables, etc.).
*   `Alert`: Contains information about a potential issue (severity, description, recommendations).

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond *verifying* the current state of a network to *predicting* future failures.  The dynamic shadow network allows for proactive analysis and remediation *before* incidents impact clients. It moves beyond simple constraint solving to a full-blown predictive failure analysis system.
