## Dynamic Data Provenance & Attestation via Blockchain-Anchored Hashes

**Concept:** Extend the transitive file storage concept by layering in a blockchain-based provenance and attestation system. This allows for verifiable data integrity and origin tracking *without* revealing the item provider directly to the untrusted server, and enhances trust in the data itself.

**Specification:**

**1. Component Overview:**

*   **Item Provider:**  Source of the data file.
*   **Trusted Server(s):**  Handles initial data reception, hashing, and blockchain interaction.
*   **Transitive File Server:**  Stores the data file temporarily.  Accessible by the Untrusted Server.
*   **Blockchain:**  A permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) used for anchoring hashes and metadata.
*   **Untrusted Server:**  Retrieves the data file from the Transitive File Server and provides it to users.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Data Submission:** The Item Provider submits a data file to the Trusted Server(s).
2.  **Hashing & Metadata Creation:** The Trusted Server(s) calculates a cryptographic hash (SHA-256 or similar) of the data file.  Metadata includes:
    *   Hash of the data file.
    *   Timestamp.
    *   Unique Item Provider ID (encrypted/obfuscated - *never* directly exposed to the Untrusted Server*).
    *   Transitive File Server address.
3.  **Blockchain Anchoring:**  The Trusted Server(s) writes a transaction to the Blockchain containing the hash, metadata, and a pointer to the Transitive File Server location.  This is the ‘anchor’ point.
4.  **Transitive Storage:** The Trusted Server(s) provides the data file to the Transitive File Server.
5.  **Notification & Verification:** The Trusted Server(s) sends a notification to the Untrusted Server. The notification *only* includes the Transitive File Server address and the Blockchain transaction ID.
6.  **Untrusted Server Verification:**  The Untrusted Server:
    *   Retrieves the Blockchain transaction using the provided ID.
    *   Verifies the hash of the retrieved data file against the hash stored in the Blockchain transaction.
    *   If the hashes match, the Untrusted Server proceeds to serve the data file. If they don't match, the file is rejected.

**3. Pseudocode (Untrusted Server Verification):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION verifyData(transactionID, transitiveFileServerAddress):
  blockchainTransaction = getBlockchainTransaction(transactionID)
  IF blockchainTransaction == NULL:
    RETURN ERROR // Transaction not found

  expectedHash = blockchainTransaction.hash

  retrievedData = downloadData(transitiveFileServerAddress)
  calculatedHash = hashData(retrievedData)

  IF calculatedHash == expectedHash:
    RETURN SUCCESS // Data verified
  ELSE:
    RETURN FAILURE // Data integrity compromised
END FUNCTION
```

**4. Key Innovations:**

*   **Decoupled Trust:** The Untrusted Server doesn't need to trust the Item Provider *or* the Trusted Server. Trust is anchored in the immutability of the Blockchain.
*   **Data Integrity Assurance:**  Cryptographic hashing guarantees that the data hasn’t been tampered with.
*   **Provenance Tracking:** The Blockchain provides an audit trail of data origin and modifications.
*   **Enhanced Security:**  Obfuscation of the Item Provider ID prevents direct association with the data.

**5. Scalability Considerations:**

*   **Permissioned Blockchain:**  A permissioned blockchain offers better scalability and control than a public blockchain.
*   **Layer 2 Solutions:** Explore Layer 2 scaling solutions for the Blockchain to handle high transaction volumes.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the Blockchain.
