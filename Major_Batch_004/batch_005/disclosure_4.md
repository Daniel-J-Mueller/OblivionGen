## Temporal Data Weaving for Predictive Maintenance

**Concept:** Leverage the variable reclamation concepts to *proactively* create optimized data states, anticipating future maintenance needs rather than reactively reclaiming space. This shifts the focus from cost savings to predictive capability.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Model:**

*   **Core Data Stream:** Continuous stream of operational data from equipment/systems (sensors, logs, performance metrics).
*   **Temporal Layers:** Data is segmented into "Temporal Layers" representing specific time windows (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week).  Each layer contains a complete snapshot of the core data.
*   **Predictive Models:**  Multiple predictive models (failure prediction, performance degradation, anomaly detection) are maintained. Each model is associated with a specific Temporal Layer.
*   **Weave Index:**  A dynamic index mapping predictive model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) to corresponding Temporal Layers.

**2.  Proactive Reclamation & Layer Creation:**

*   **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the performance of predictive models against a validation dataset.
*   **Weave Algorithm:**
    *   If a model's performance *declines* below a threshold, its associated Temporal Layer is prioritized for "weaving."
    *   Weaving involves:
        *   Identifying overlapping Temporal Layers (e.g., last 7 days).
        *   Using data from overlapping layers to *retrain* the predictive model.
        *   Generating a *new* Temporal Layer with the retrained model.
        *   Replacing the original layer with the retrained layer.
        *   Reducing the retention period of older, less-relevant layers.
*   **Adaptive Granularity:** The size of Temporal Layers (time window) adjusts dynamically based on data volatility. Highly volatile data results in smaller layers, enabling faster model updates.

**3.  Data Storage & Access:**

*   **Layered Storage:**  Temporal Layers are stored in a tiered storage system.  Frequently accessed layers (used for current predictions) are stored on high-performance storage. Older layers are moved to lower-cost storage.
*   **Virtual Data Points:**  Instead of storing complete data snapshots, the system stores *differences* between adjacent Temporal Layers (delta compression). This reduces storage costs.
*   **Query Engine:**  A specialized query engine efficiently retrieves data from multiple Temporal Layers for generating predictions. The query engine uses the Weave Index to identify the most relevant layers.

**4. Pseudocode â€“ Weave Algorithm Core:**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION weave(currentLayer, validationData):

    // 1. Evaluate performance
    performanceScore = evaluateModel(currentLayer.model, validationData)

    // 2. Check if performance is below threshold
    IF performanceScore < performanceThreshold:

        // 3. Identify overlapping layers
        overlappingLayers = findOverlappingLayers(currentLayer, timeWindow)

        // 4. Retrain model using overlapping data
        newModel = retrainModel(overlappingLayers.data)

        // 5. Create a new Temporal Layer
        newLayer = createTemporalLayer(newModel, currentTime)

        // 6. Replace existing layer
        replaceTemporalLayer(currentLayer, newLayer)

        // 7. Reclaim space from older layers
        reclaimSpace(olderLayers, reclamationRate)

    ENDIF

END FUNCTION
```

**5.  Additional Considerations:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Weave the system with anomaly detection models to dynamically adjust layer sizes and reclamation rates.
*   **Automated Model Selection:** Implement automated machine learning (AutoML) to dynamically select the best predictive models for each data stream.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** Integrate XAI techniques to provide insights into the factors driving predictions.
