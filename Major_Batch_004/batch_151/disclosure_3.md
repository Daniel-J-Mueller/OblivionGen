## Adaptive Network Persona Construction

**Concept:** Extend the hash-based search to dynamically construct "network personas" for users based on their traffic patterns, providing proactive security and personalized network experiences. This moves beyond simple search to *predictive* network behavior analysis.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Persona Definition:** A network persona is a data structure containing weighted key-value pairs representing characteristic network behaviors. Keys represent features derived from parsed traffic (e.g., frequently visited domains, common application protocols, typical data transfer sizes, common search terms â€“ *hashed, of course*), and values represent the frequency or probability of that behavior occurring for a given user.

2.  **Real-time Persona Construction:**
    *   As network traffic is intercepted (as in the patent), the traffic is parsed into tokens and hashed.
    *   These hashes are *not only* used for search requests, but also *accumulated* into a rolling window of behavioral data for each user (identified via IP address, login credentials, or other identifying information).
    *   A weighted scoring system assigns points to each observed hash based on its rarity or significance.  Common hashes receive low scores; rare or potentially malicious hashes receive high scores.
    *   The persona is updated continuously with these weighted scores, effectively creating a probabilistic model of the user's typical network activity.  Exponential decay can be used to give more weight to recent activity.

3.  **Anomaly Detection & Proactive Security:**
    *   Incoming traffic is compared to the user's established persona. Significant deviations from the expected behavior trigger alerts or proactive security measures (e.g., multi-factor authentication requests, traffic throttling, temporary account lockout).
    *   Anomaly scores are calculated based on the magnitude and frequency of deviations.

4.  **Personalized Network Experience:**
    *   The persona data can be used to optimize network performance for each user (e.g., prioritizing bandwidth for frequently used applications, caching frequently accessed content).
    *   Personalized content recommendations can be delivered based on the user's browsing history (again, based on *hashed* search terms and visited domains).

5.  **Persona Clustering & Threat Intelligence:**
    *   User personas can be clustered based on similarity, allowing for the identification of potential threats. For example, a cluster of users exhibiting similar malicious behavior could indicate a coordinated attack.
    *   Aggregate persona data can be used to improve threat intelligence and proactively identify emerging threats.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detectAnomaly(trafficHash, userPersona) {
  // Calculate a "similarity score" between the incoming traffic hash and the user persona
  similarityScore = calculateSimilarity(trafficHash, userPersona)

  // Define a threshold for anomaly detection
  anomalyThreshold = 0.7 // Example threshold

  if (similarityScore < anomalyThreshold) {
    // Anomaly detected!
    anomalyScore = 1 - similarityScore //Calculate severity

    //Trigger Alert/Security Measure
    triggerSecurityAction(anomalyScore)
    return true; //Anomaly found
  } else {
    return false; //No anomaly detected
  }
}

function calculateSimilarity(trafficHash, userPersona) {
  //This function would calculate a similarity score.
  //Implementation details depend on the representation of the persona and trafficHash.
  //Options include cosine similarity, Jaccard index, or other appropriate metrics.
  //The goal is to quantify how closely the current traffic aligns with the user's known behavior.
  //(Implementation would require defining data structures for personas and hashes to perform the calculation)
  return similarityScore;
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **UserPersona:**  `{ userID: string, behaviorData: {hash: string, weight: float}[] }`
*   **TrafficHash:** `string` (SHA-256 hash of token set)

This builds on the hash-based search in the original patent but introduces a dynamic, predictive layer for both security and user experience enhancement.  It transforms passive traffic monitoring into active behavioral analysis.
