## Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment Based on Commentator Engagement

**Concept:** Extend the system to dynamically adjust the 'difficulty' or complexity of work segments presented to commentators based on real-time engagement metrics. This aims to optimize feedback quality and quantity by matching segment complexity to commentator skill/attention levels.

**Specs:**

1.  **Engagement Metric Calculation:**
    *   Track key commentator behaviors:
        *   Time spent reviewing a segment.
        *   Number of edits/revisions to comments.
        *   Sentiment analysis of comments (positive/negative/neutral – gauge effort).
        *   Comment length (proxy for detail).
        *   Response rate to specific prompts within the segment.
    *   Combine these into a composite “Engagement Score” for each commentator/segment pair.
2.  **Segment Complexity Rating:**
    *   Pre-assign or algorithmically derive a “Complexity Score” for each segment. Factors:
        *   Text length/density.
        *   Number of characters/plot lines.
        *   Presence of nuanced themes or symbolism.
        *   Technical jargon or specialized vocabulary.
    *   Complexity Score range: 1-10 (1=simple, 10=highly complex).
3.  **Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   Monitor Engagement Score during initial segment presentation.
    *   If Engagement Score falls below a threshold (e.g., 60%), automatically:
        *   Present a simplified version of the segment (e.g., shorter, less detailed).
        *   Provide additional context or guiding questions.
        *   Lower the complexity score of the next segment.
    *   If Engagement Score is high, automatically:
        *   Present a more complex version of the segment.
        *   Introduce open-ended prompts.
        *   Increase the complexity score of the next segment.
    *   Algorithm:
        ```pseudocode
        function adjustSegment(commentator, segment):
          engagementScore = calculateEngagementScore(commentator, segment)
          complexityScore = getComplexityScore(segment)
          if engagementScore < thresholdLow:
            segment = simplifySegment(segment)
            complexityScore = min(complexityScore - 1, 1)
          elif engagementScore > thresholdHigh:
            segment = complexifySegment(segment)
            complexityScore = max(complexityScore + 1, 10)
          setComplexityScore(segment, complexityScore)
          return segment
        ```
4.  **Commentator Skill Level Tracking:**
    *   Maintain a “Skill Profile” for each commentator based on their historical Engagement Scores across various segment complexities.
    *   Use the Skill Profile to predict optimal segment complexity for future presentations.
5.  **A/B Testing & Optimization:**
    *   Implement A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of dynamic adjustment algorithms and identify optimal threshold values.
    *   Continuously refine algorithms based on performance data.
6. **Integration with Existing System**:
    *   The above can be implemented via API extension to the existing framework.
    *   New engagement data can be logged and used to refine the existing segment ranking.
7. **User Interface Modification**:
    * Add a dynamic complexity indicator to the user interface, showing the current segment's difficulty level.
    * Allow users to manually override the algorithm's recommendations.
