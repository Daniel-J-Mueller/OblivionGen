## Dynamic HSM Attestation with Predictive Bloom Filters

**Concept:** Extend the HSM's validation capabilities to proactively assess data integrity *before* decryption, using a tiered Bloom filter system informed by predictive analytics and external threat intelligence.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Predictive Threat Engine (PTE):** An external service that consumes real-time threat intelligence feeds (e.g., compromised payment card databases, known fraudulent patterns). The PTE generates probabilistic "risk scores" for incoming data based on identifiers (e.g., card numbers, account IDs).
*   **Tiered Bloom Filter System:**  Within the HSM:
    *   **Tier 1 (High-Speed, Low-Precision):** A large, rapidly searchable Bloom filter populated with known *good* data (legitimate merchants, trusted account ranges). Initial checks occur here.
    *   **Tier 2 (Adaptive, Medium-Precision):** A dynamic Bloom filter that adjusts its parameters (hash functions, filter size) based on the risk score from the PTE. Higher risk scores result in a more sensitive (but slower) filter.  This filter primarily checks for known *bad* data.
    *   **Tier 3 (Granular, High-Precision):** A small, highly specific Bloom filter built on recent transaction history for *that specific account/merchant combination*. This acts as a personalized anomaly detector.
*   **Attestation Manager:**  Handles requests, orchestrates filter lookups, and determines decryption authorization.

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  **API Call Received:** HSM receives a validation request with encrypted data and associated identifiers.
2.  **Risk Score Calculation:** Identifiers are sent to the PTE, which returns a risk score.
3.  **Tier 1 Lookup:** HSM checks Tier 1 Bloom filter.  If the identifier is present (known good), proceed to decryption.
4.  **Tier 2 Lookup:** If Tier 1 misses, HSM checks Tier 2 Bloom filter. A hit indicates known bad data, triggering an immediate rejection.
5.  **Tier 3 Lookup:** If Tier 2 misses, HSM checks Tier 3 Bloom filter. A hit indicates anomalous activity, potentially triggering additional verification steps (e.g., 3D Secure).
6.  **Decryption & Validation:** If all filters pass, the data is decrypted and standard business rule validation occurs.
7.  **Filter Updates:**  New data (both good and bad) is used to dynamically update the Bloom filters in real-time. The Tier 3 filter learns from each transaction.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
function validateData(encryptedData, identifiers):
  riskScore = getRiskScore(identifiers)
  
  if isPresentInTier1(identifiers):
    return SUCCESS
  
  if isPresentInTier2(identifiers, riskScore):
    return FAILURE
  
  if isAnomalyDetectedInTier3(identifiers):
    triggerAdditionalVerification()
  
  decryptData(encryptedData)
  applyBusinessRules(decryptedData)
  
  return SUCCESS
```

**IV. Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   HSM with sufficient memory and processing power to manage multiple Bloom filters.
*   Secure communication channel to the PTE.
*   Real-time data feed integration for the PTE.
*   Dynamic Bloom filter implementation with adjustable parameters.
*   Machine learning algorithms for Tier 3 filter personalization.
*   API for external integration.
