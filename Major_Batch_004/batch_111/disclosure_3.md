## Adaptive Query Rewriting with Predictive Model Integration

**System Specifications:** A module integrated within the database query optimizer capable of dynamically rewriting queries based on predictions from a continuously trained machine learning model. This model predicts query performance characteristics *before* execution, allowing for proactive optimization beyond traditional cost-based optimization.

**Core Components:**

*   **Performance Prediction Model:** A time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) trained on historical query execution data (execution time, resource consumption, I/O operations). Input features include query text, table statistics, index availability, and system load. Output is a predicted query execution cost vector.
*   **Query Rewriter:** A rule-based engine that transforms SQL queries based on input from the Performance Prediction Model. Rules include:
    *   **Index Recommendation/Forcing:** If the model predicts significant performance gain from a specific index, force its use even if the traditional optimizer doesn't.
    *   **Join Order Optimization:** Explore and apply alternative join orders predicted to be faster.
    *   **Data Partitioning Hints:** Add hints to guide the database to distribute data more effectively for parallel processing.
    *   **Materialized View Utilization:** Suggest creation or utilization of materialized views for frequently accessed data.
    *   **Function Inlining/Outlining:** Dynamically inline or outline function calls based on predicted overhead.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** A system to compare the performance of rewritten queries against the original query plan. Data is collected and used to retrain the Performance Prediction Model, improving its accuracy.
*   **Explainability Module:** Provides insight into *why* a query was rewritten, helping administrators understand and trust the system.

**Pseudocode (Query Rewrite Logic):**

```
function rewriteQuery(query, predictionModel) {
  prediction = predictionModel.predict(query)
  rewrittenQuery = query

  if (prediction.indexRecommendation != null) {
    rewrittenQuery = applyIndexHint(rewrittenQuery, prediction.indexRecommendation)
  }

  if (prediction.joinOrder != null) {
    rewrittenQuery = changeJoinOrder(rewrittenQuery, prediction.joinOrder)
  }

  if (prediction.materializedView != null) {
    rewrittenQuery = useMaterializedView(rewrittenQuery, prediction.materializedView)
  }

  // ... other rewrite rules ...

  return rewrittenQuery
}

function applyIndexHint(query, indexName) {
  // Add index hint to query
  // ...
}

function changeJoinOrder(query, newOrder) {
  // Rewrite query with new join order
  // ...
}

function useMaterializedView(query, viewName) {
  // Rewrite query to use materialized view
  // ...
}
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Database receives SQL query.
2.  Performance Prediction Model predicts query performance characteristics.
3.  Query Rewriter transforms query based on prediction.
4.  Rewritten query is executed.
5.  Execution statistics are collected.
6.  Performance Prediction Model is retrained with new data.
