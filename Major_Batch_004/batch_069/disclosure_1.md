## Dynamic Anticipatory Asset Delivery – ‘DAAD’

**Concept:** Leveraging the pre-loading principles outlined in the provided patent, but shifting the focus *from* content delivery *to* anticipatory delivery of digital assets required for augmented reality (AR) experiences *within* a physical space.  Instead of pre-loading website elements, this system pre-loads 3D models, textures, audio cues, and other assets required for AR applications *before* a user physically enters a designated area.

**Core Innovation:**  Instead of predicting *what* a user will browse, this predicts *where* a user will be and pre-loads assets for AR experiences relevant to that location.  This drastically reduces latency and improves the user experience for location-based AR.

**Specs:**

**1. Geospatial Trigger System:**

*   **Input:**  Mobile device GPS data, WiFi/Bluetooth beacon data, cellular tower triangulation.
*   **Processing:**  Real-time tracking of user location. Geo-fencing creation – defining areas where AR experiences are available.  Prediction of user trajectory based on historical movement data (optional – requires user consent).  Distance-to-trigger calculation – determining how far in advance to begin asset delivery.
*   **Output:**  Trigger event signal – initiating asset delivery process.

**2. Asset Prioritization & Reduction Engine:**

*   **Input:**  List of potential AR assets associated with the current geo-fence.  User’s device capabilities (CPU, GPU, memory, screen resolution). Network connectivity information. User profile data (interests, AR usage history - optional, with consent).
*   **Processing:**  Asset prioritization based on relevance to user profile & predicted activity.  Level of Detail (LOD) selection – dynamically reducing asset complexity based on device capabilities.  Texture compression & optimization.  Audio compression.  Asset bundling & streaming optimization.
*   **Output:**  Reduced asset package optimized for user device and network conditions.

**3. Dynamic Asset Delivery System:**

*   **Input:** Optimized asset package.  User device connection type (WiFi, 5G, LTE). Real-time network bandwidth estimation.
*   **Processing:**  Delivery protocol selection (HTTP/2, QUIC).  Adaptive bitrate streaming.  Content caching on edge servers.  Error correction & retry mechanisms.
*   **Output:**  Seamless delivery of AR assets to user device *before* the user physically enters the AR zone.

**4. AR Application Integration:**

*   **API:**  Provides a standardized interface for AR applications to request and utilize pre-loaded assets.
*   **Asset Management:**  Manages the storage and retrieval of pre-loaded assets on the device.
*   **Synchronization:**  Ensures that the AR application and the pre-loaded assets are synchronized and consistent.

**Pseudocode (Delivery System):**

```
function deliverAssets(userID, geoFenceID) {
  // 1. Retrieve relevant assets for geoFenceID
  assetList = getAssetList(geoFenceID);

  // 2. Prioritize and reduce assets for user device
  optimizedAssets = optimizeAssets(assetList, getUserDeviceCapabilities(userID));

  // 3. Check network connection
  connectionType = getConnectionType(userID);
  bandwidth = getBandwidth(userID);

  // 4. Select delivery protocol
  protocol = selectProtocol(connectionType, bandwidth);

  // 5. Stream or download assets
  if (protocol == "streaming") {
    streamAssets(optimizedAssets, userID);
  } else {
    downloadAssets(optimizedAssets, userID);
  }

  // 6. Verify download/stream integrity
  verifyAssets(optimizedAssets, userID);

  // 7. Notify AR application assets are ready
  notifyApp(userID, "assetsReady");
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Museums & Historical Sites: Pre-load 3D models of artifacts & exhibits for AR overlays.
*   Retail Stores:  Pre-load product information & AR experiences for in-store browsing.
*   Theme Parks:  Pre-load AR characters & interactive elements for themed areas.
*   Smart Cities:  Pre-load building information & AR navigation guides for urban exploration.
