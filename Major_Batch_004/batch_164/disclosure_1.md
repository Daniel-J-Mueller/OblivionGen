**Dynamic Terrain Resonance System**

**Concept:** Extend the destructibility model to incorporate a physics-based resonance system affecting terrain deformation and propagation of destruction. Instead of simply changing textures or destructibility values, model the terrain as a network of interconnected resonant bodies.

**Specifications:**

*   **Terrain Representation:** Divide terrain into voxels (3D pixels). Each voxel possesses:
    *   Material properties (density, elasticity, damping) – assigned based on initial terrain type (grass, rock, sand, etc.)
    *   Resonance frequency – calculated based on material properties and voxel size.
    *   Connectivity data – list of adjacent voxels.
    *   Current displacement vector.

*   **Destruction Event Handling:**
    1.  **Impact Detection:** Upon a 'destruction causing event' (explosion, impact, etc.), determine the point of impact and its intensity.
    2.  **Initial Displacement:** Apply an initial displacement to the impacted voxel(s) proportional to the event intensity.
    3.  **Resonance Propagation:**
        *   Iterate through connected voxels.
        *   Calculate the force transmitted to each voxel based on:
            *   The force applied to the originating voxel.
            *   The material properties of both voxels.
            *   The distance and angle between the voxels.
        *   Apply the calculated force, resulting in displacement.
        *   Repeat this process for a defined number of iterations or until the energy dissipates below a threshold.

*   **Destructibility Value Integration:**
    *   Each voxel also has a 'structural integrity' value. This value decreases with accumulated displacement.
    *   When structural integrity reaches zero, the voxel is removed or changes to a 'debris' state (smaller, less resonant voxels).
    *   The destructibility value from the original patent *modulates* the rate at which structural integrity decreases. Higher destructibility = slower decay.

*   **Rendering:**
    *   The rendering engine accesses the displacement vectors of each voxel to deform the terrain mesh in real-time.
    *   Visual effects (dust, debris, cracks) are triggered based on structural integrity values and displacement magnitudes.

**Pseudocode (Resonance Propagation):**

```
function propagate_resonance(impacted_voxel, impact_force):
  queue = [impacted_voxel]
  iterations = 10 // Tune this value

  for i in range(iterations):
    new_queue = []
    for voxel in queue:
      for neighbor in voxel.neighbors:
        force = calculate_force(voxel, neighbor, impact_force)
        neighbor.apply_force(force)
        new_queue.append(neighbor)
    queue = new_queue

function calculate_force(source_voxel, target_voxel, impact_force):
  distance = calculate_distance(source_voxel, target_voxel)
  material_factor = (source_voxel.material_properties + target_voxel.material_properties) / 2
  force = impact_force * material_factor / distance
  return force

function apply_force(voxel, force):
  voxel.displacement += force * voxel.mass
  voxel.structural_integrity -= force * voxel.fragility
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple texture changes and destructibility value adjustments to a fully physics-based simulation. Terrain isn’t just *destroyed*; it *resonates* and propagates destruction realistically. This can lead to emergent behaviors, chain reactions, and more visually impressive destruction sequences. This also allows for the creation of dynamic terrain features based on seismic activity, wind erosion, or other environmental factors.
