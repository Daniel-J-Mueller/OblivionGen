## Dynamic IP Address ‘Shadowing’ for Predictive Migration

**Concept:** Extend the existing IP address reassignment system with a ‘shadowing’ mechanism. Instead of immediately reassigning an IP address, the system *pre-assigns* it to the destination VM while the source VM continues to operate. This creates a temporary period where both VMs share the same IP, handled via intelligent packet routing.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** ‘Shadow Router’ – a software-defined networking (SDN) element integrated with the provider network. This is *not* a full routing replacement, but sits alongside existing infrastructure.
*   **API Extension:** Add a ‘migrate’ flag to the existing IP reassignment API call. This indicates a predictive migration is desired.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Customer submits API call with `migrate = true` for IP address X, from VM A to VM B.
    2.  Network Manager instructs DHCP server to:
        *   Assign IP address X *to both* VM A and VM B.  Crucially, the DHCP lease for VM B is *shorter* than for VM A.
        *   Include a ‘shadowing’ flag within the DHCP response – this informs the VMs of the temporary dual assignment.
    3.  Shadow Router intercepts traffic destined for IP address X:
        *   Initially, all traffic is forwarded to VM A.
        *   As the DHCP lease for VM B becomes valid (shortly after assignment), the Shadow Router dynamically begins forwarding a percentage of traffic to VM B, increasing this percentage over time.  The rate of increase is configurable.
        *   Simultaneously, the Shadow Router monitors traffic flowing *from* both VMs.  If it detects conflicting responses (e.g., duplicate TCP sequence numbers), it prioritizes traffic from VM A initially, then gradually shifts to VM B, employing standard TCP congestion control mechanisms to minimize disruption.
    4.  Once the DHCP lease for VM A expires, the Shadow Router fully redirects all traffic to VM B. The original IP is released from VM A.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `ShadowingEntry`:
        *   `ip_address`: The shadowed IP address.
        *   `source_vm_id`: ID of the source VM.
        *   `destination_vm_id`: ID of the destination VM.
        *   `migration_start_time`: Timestamp when migration began.
        *   `traffic_split_percentage`: Current percentage of traffic forwarded to the destination VM.
        *   `congestion_control_parameters`: Parameters for TCP congestion control.
*   **Pseudocode (Shadow Router Traffic Handling):**

```
function handle_incoming_packet(packet, shadowing_table):
  ip_address = packet.destination_ip

  shadowing_entry = shadowing_table.lookup(ip_address)

  if shadowing_entry != null:
    if shadowing_entry.traffic_split_percentage < 100:
      # Randomly decide whether to forward to source or destination
      if random_number < shadowing_entry.traffic_split_percentage:
        forward_packet_to(shadowing_entry.destination_vm_id)
      else:
        forward_packet_to(shadowing_entry.source_vm_id)
    else:
      forward_packet_to(shadowing_entry.destination_vm_id)
  else:
    # No shadowing in progress, forward normally
    forward_packet_to(destination_vm)
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Zero-Downtime Migration:** Applications experience no interruption during IP reassignment.
*   **Application-Aware Migration:**  The gradual traffic shift allows applications to gracefully handle the change.
*   **Improved Reliability:** The system can dynamically adapt to VM failures during migration.
*   **Predictive Optimization:** The Shadow Router can analyze traffic patterns and proactively optimize the migration process.
