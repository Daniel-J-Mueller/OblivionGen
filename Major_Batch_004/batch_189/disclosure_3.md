## Modular Environmental Sensor Network for Doorbell Integration

**Concept:** Expand the doorbell’s functionality beyond simple audio/video capture and signaling by integrating a modular, wireless environmental sensor network. This network would leverage the existing power delivery concepts of the patent (splitting AC waveform usage) to power a distributed array of sensors surrounding the property, providing contextual data to the doorbell system.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Modules:**
    *   Dimensions: 40mm x 40mm x 20mm (approximate).
    *   Power: Draws < 50mW (designed for split AC waveform powering or low-voltage battery/supercapacitor operation).
    *   Wireless Communication: Sub-GHz radio (LoRa, Zigbee, or custom protocol) for long-range, low-power communication.  Range: 100m+ line of sight.
    *   Enclosure: Weatherproof, UV-resistant plastic.
    *   Mounting: Magnetic or adhesive mounting options.
    *   Sensor Suite (Modular – selectable at time of purchase/installation):
        *   Motion Sensor (PIR or Microwave).
        *   Temperature/Humidity Sensor.
        *   Air Quality Sensor (VOC, CO, CO2).
        *   Light Sensor (Ambient Light Level).
        *   Sound Sensor (dB Level, frequency analysis).
        *   Vibration Sensor.
        *   Water Leak Detector.
*   **Base Station/Doorbell Integration Unit:**
    *   Integrated into existing doorbell housing or separate small enclosure.
    *   Sub-GHz radio receiver.
    *   Microcontroller (ESP32 or similar).
    *   Wi-Fi/Ethernet connectivity.
    *   Power: Powered by existing doorbell power supply.
    *   Data Logging/Processing: Local data storage (SD card) and cloud connectivity.
*   **Power Distribution:** Utilize the patent's concept of splitting the AC waveform to provide power to the sensor modules. A localized transformer-rectifier setup at each sensor module could convert the AC waveform portion to DC for operation. Alternatively, modules could harvest energy from the waveform and store it in a small supercapacitor.

**Software Specifications (Doorbell Firmware/App):**

*   **Sensor Network Management:**
    *   Automatic sensor discovery and pairing.
    *   Sensor status monitoring (battery level, signal strength).
    *   Configuration of sensor thresholds and alerts.
*   **Event Correlation & Logic:**
    *   Define rules to trigger actions based on sensor data. *Example:* "If motion detected at the driveway sensor AND no one is at the door, alert the user."
    *   Contextual Awareness: The doorbell app displays relevant sensor data alongside video feed. *Example:*  "Driveway motion detected 2 minutes ago. Temperature is 25°C."
*   **Data Visualization:**
    *   Historical sensor data charting.
    *   Real-time sensor data display.
*   **API Integration:**
    *   Open API for third-party integration (home automation systems, security platforms).

**Pseudocode (Event Correlation):**

```
function processSensorData(sensorID, sensorType, sensorValue) {
  if (sensorType == "motion" && sensorValue == "detected") {
    if (getSensorValue("doorbell_status") != "active") {
      sendNotification("Motion detected at " + sensorID + " while no one is at the door.");
      // Optionally trigger camera recording
    }
  }

  if (sensorType == "temperature" && sensorValue > 30) {
    sendNotification("High temperature detected at " + sensorID + ".  Current temp: " + sensorValue + "°C");
  }

  // Add more conditions and actions based on sensor data
}

function mainLoop() {
  while (true) {
    // Receive sensor data from network
    sensorData = receiveSensorData();

    // Process sensor data
    processSensorData(sensorData.sensorID, sensorData.sensorType, sensorData.sensorValue);

    // Delay for short period
    delay(100ms);
  }
}
```

**Potential Applications/Value Proposition:**

*   Enhanced Security: Early warning of potential intruders.
*   Smart Home Integration: Triggering automated actions based on environmental data.
*   Preventative Maintenance: Detecting water leaks or temperature fluctuations.
*   Improved Convenience: Contextual awareness for informed decision-making.
*   Proactive alerts for events.
