## Adaptive Sensory Input Prioritization & Augmentation

**System Overview:** A system designed to dynamically prioritize and augment sensory input based on inferred user intent gleaned from multi-modal data analysis. This builds on the trigger/keyword concept but expands it to *all* sensory inputs, not just audio, and creates a layered, adaptive experience.

**Core Components:**

*   **Multi-Modal Sensor Array:** Beyond microphones, includes:
    *   Low-resolution, wide-angle camera (contextual visual data)
    *   Bio-sensor array (heart rate variability, skin conductance – for emotional state)
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - device orientation & movement
    *   Ambient environmental sensors (temperature, light levels, air quality)
*   **Contextual Inference Engine:** A deep learning model trained to infer user intent/focus based on the combined sensor data. This goes beyond simple keyword spotting to understand *what the user is likely trying to achieve*.
*   **Sensory Prioritization Matrix:** A dynamic weighting system that controls the flow of information to the user. This isn’t about *blocking* information, but about subtly emphasizing certain streams.
*   **Augmentation Layer:** Synthesizes additional sensory information to enhance the user experience. This could be haptic feedback, subtle visual cues, or tailored audio overlays.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Continuous capture of multi-modal sensor data.
2.  **Intent Inference:** The Contextual Inference Engine analyzes the data to determine the user’s likely intent/focus (e.g., “focusing on a task”, “seeking relaxation”, “experiencing stress”, “navigating a space”).
3.  **Prioritization Adjustment:** The Sensory Prioritization Matrix adjusts the weighting of incoming sensory streams based on the inferred intent.
    *   *Example:* If the user is inferred to be "focusing on a task", audio alerts are attenuated, visual clutter is minimized, and haptic feedback confirming task completion is emphasized.
4.  **Augmentation Synthesis:** The Augmentation Layer synthesizes additional sensory information to enhance the user experience.
    *   *Example:* If the user is inferred to be "experiencing stress", calming ambient sounds are subtly introduced, a gentle haptic pulse is applied, and visual cues are softened.
5.  **Sensory Delivery:** Prioritized and augmented sensory streams are delivered to the user through various output devices (speakers, display, haptic actuators).

**Pseudocode (Prioritization Adjustment):**

```
// Global Variables
float audioWeight;
float visualWeight;
float hapticWeight;
float ambientWeight;

// Function: adjustPriorities(inferredIntent)
function adjustPriorities(inferredIntent) {

    switch (inferredIntent) {
        case "focus":
            audioWeight = 0.2;
            visualWeight = 0.6;
            hapticWeight = 0.8;
            ambientWeight = 0.1;
            break;
        case "relaxation":
            audioWeight = 0.7;
            visualWeight = 0.3;
            hapticWeight = 0.4;
            ambientWeight = 0.6;
            break;
        case "stress":
            audioWeight = 0.3;
            visualWeight = 0.2;
            hapticWeight = 0.5;
            ambientWeight = 0.7;
            break;
        default: // Default state
            audioWeight = 0.5;
            visualWeight = 0.5;
            hapticWeight = 0.5;
            ambientWeight = 0.5;
    }
}

// In the main loop, call adjustPriorities() based on the current inferred intent.
// Then, apply these weights to the incoming sensory streams before delivering them to the user.
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Low-power embedded processor for real-time data processing.
*   Compact, lightweight sensor array.
*   Integration with existing wearable devices (smartwatches, headphones, AR/VR headsets).
*   Secure data storage and transmission.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced productivity and focus.
*   Stress reduction and relaxation.
*   Improved situational awareness.
*   Accessibility for individuals with sensory impairments.
*   Personalized entertainment experiences.
