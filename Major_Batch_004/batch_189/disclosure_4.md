## Dynamic Focal Plane Array

**Concept:** A camera system utilizing a micro-lens array and dynamically adjustable optical elements to create a variable focal plane, effectively allowing for simultaneous multi-depth capture *without* physically moving any lenses.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor:** High-resolution CMOS sensor with micro-lens array (MLA) bonded directly to the surface. MLA pitch (lens spacing) optimized for target resolution and depth of field.
*   **Actuators:** Each micro-lens in the MLA is coupled to a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) actuator. Actuators allow for individual control of micro-lens height/curvature.
*   **Control System:** Real-time processing unit (RPU) analyzes incoming light field data and calculates actuator commands.  RPU includes a depth estimation algorithm.
*   **Illumination:** Integrated structured light projector (optional). Emits a known pattern of light to aid in depth map creation and improve accuracy.
*   **Data Output:** High-bandwidth interface (e.g., MIPI CSI-2) for streaming depth maps and multi-focal images.

**Innovation Detail:**

The core idea is to shift the focal plane *electronically*, using the MEMS-controlled micro-lenses. This eliminates the need for mechanical focusing mechanisms, enabling significantly faster focusing and the ability to capture information from multiple depths simultaneously.

**Pseudocode (simplified control loop):**

```
//Initialization
initialize_sensor()
initialize_actuators()
load_depth_estimation_model()

//Main loop
while (camera_active):

    capture_raw_image()

    depth_map = estimate_depth_from_image(raw_image)

    for each micro-lens in MLA:
        desired_height = depth_map[micro-lens_index] * scaling_factor
        set_actuator_height(micro-lens_index, desired_height)

    capture_multi-focal_image() //Capture image with adjusted micro-lenses

    process_multi-focal_image()

    output_data()
```

**Operational Details:**

1.  **Baseline Capture:** The camera captures a baseline image with the micro-lenses in a neutral position.
2.  **Depth Estimation:** The RPU analyzes the baseline image (or uses data from the optional structured light projector) to create a depth map of the scene.
3.  **Actuation Control:** Based on the depth map, the RPU calculates the appropriate height/curvature for each micro-lens.  Micro-lenses closer to objects in the foreground are adjusted to focus on those objects, while those closer to background objects are adjusted accordingly.
4.  **Multi-Focal Capture:** The camera captures a second image with the micro-lenses adjusted to create a multi-focal image.  Different regions of the image are now in focus at different depths.
5.  **Image Processing:** The multi-focal image is then processed to create a final image with an extended depth of field, or to allow the user to select a specific depth of field.  Algorithms can deblur or sharpen regions as needed.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Computational Photography:**  Creating images with dramatically extended depth of field.
*   **Autonomous Navigation:**  Providing robots with a detailed 3D understanding of their environment.
*   **Medical Imaging:**  Capturing detailed images of biological samples at different depths.
*   **Augmented Reality:**  Overlaying virtual objects onto real-world scenes with accurate depth perception.
*   **Security/Surveillance:** Enhanced object recognition and tracking.
