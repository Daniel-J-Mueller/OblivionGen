# 9110680

## Adaptive Memory Partitioning via Predictive Access Patterns

**Specification:**

This system aims to enhance the copy-on-write (COW) mechanism described in patent 9110680 by moving beyond simple page-level allocation to dynamically sized, predictive memory partitions. It leverages machine learning to anticipate data access patterns *within* a buffer, pre-allocating and isolating frequently modified sections.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Access Pattern Monitor (APM):** A kernel-level module that passively observes memory access patterns within buffers allocated for COW.  It records:
    *   Address accessed
    *   Access type (read, write, execute)
    *   Timestamp
    *   Context (process ID, thread ID)
2.  **Predictive Partition Manager (PPM):** This module uses the data collected by the APM to build a predictive model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) for each buffer. The model predicts which memory regions are most likely to be modified.
3.  **Adaptive Memory Allocator (AMA):** Based on the PPM's predictions, the AMA allocates memory *within* the buffer in dynamically sized partitions.
    *   Frequently modified regions receive their own dedicated partitions.
    *   Read-only or infrequently modified regions share partitions.
    *   Partitions are managed using COW at the partition level, *not* page level.
4.  **Dynamic Partition Resizer (DPR):** Continuously monitors access patterns and resizes partitions in real-time.  If a region’s modification rate changes significantly, its partition size is adjusted.

**Workflow:**

1.  When a buffer is allocated for COW, the APM begins monitoring access patterns.
2.  The PPM trains a predictive model based on the initial access data.
3.  The AMA allocates memory for the buffer, creating partitions based on the PPM’s predictions.
4.  The DPR continuously monitors access patterns and resizes partitions as needed.
5.  When a write operation occurs, the AMA checks which partition the access falls within.  If the partition is shared, a copy is created for that partition *only*.
6.  The PPM and DPR continuously refine the partitioning scheme based on evolving access patterns.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Partition Resizer - DPR):**

```
function resize_partitions(buffer, access_pattern_data):
  // access_pattern_data contains recent memory access statistics
  
  predicted_modification_rates = PPM.predict_modification_rates(access_pattern_data)
  
  current_partitions = buffer.get_partitions()
  
  for i in range(len(current_partitions)):
    partition = current_partitions[i]
    predicted_rate = predicted_modification_rates[i]
    
    if predicted_rate > threshold_high:
      //Increase partition size
      new_size = calculate_new_size(partition.size, growth_factor)
      if new_size > buffer.max_size:
        //Handle overflow – potentially re-allocate buffer or trim other partitions
        reduce_other_partitions(buffer, new_size)
      else:
        resize_partition(partition, new_size)
        
    elif predicted_rate < threshold_low:
      //Decrease partition size or merge with adjacent partition
      if partition.size > min_partition_size:
        resize_partition(partition, calculate_new_size(partition.size, shrink_factor))
      else:
        //Attempt to merge with adjacent partition
        merge_with_adjacent(partition)
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Copying Overhead:** By isolating frequently modified sections, copying is minimized.
*   **Improved Performance:** Faster write operations due to smaller copy sizes.
*   **Adaptive Resource Utilization:** Memory is allocated dynamically based on actual usage patterns.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** Enables more precise control over memory allocation and COW behavior.

**Considerations:**

*   **Model Training Overhead:** Training the predictive model requires computational resources.
*   **Partition Management Complexity:** Managing dynamically sized partitions is more complex than page-level allocation.
*   **Overhead of DPR:** Continuous monitoring and resizing can introduce overhead.
