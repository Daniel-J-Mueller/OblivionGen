## Adaptive Classification Confidence via Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the classification system by incorporating user behavioral biometrics to dynamically adjust the confidence threshold. The system learns how a user interacts with classification confirmations (speed, accuracy, hesitation) and uses this data to refine the confidence level required before a manual review is triggered.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw user interaction data during manual classification confirmation (e.g., mouse movements, keystroke dynamics, touch screen pressure, response time).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Time-series data extraction.
    *   Feature engineering: calculate metrics like response time, hesitation (time spent before confirmation), movement smoothness, error rate (for touch/pen input).
    *   Data normalization and cleaning.
*   **Output:** Feature vector representing user behavior during classification confirmation.

**2. Behavioral Profile Builder:**

*   **Input:** Feature vectors from Data Acquisition Module, user ID.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Establish a baseline behavioral profile for each user. This could be a simple average of feature values over a period of time, or a more complex statistical model. Utilize a rolling average or similar temporal smoothing to account for short-term variations.
    *   Maintain a user-specific behavioral profile database.
    *   Store anomaly detection thresholds.
*   **Output:** User-specific behavioral profile and anomaly detection thresholds.

**3. Confidence Adjustment Module:**

*   **Input:** Current confidence score from the classification system, User ID, real-time feature vector from Data Acquisition Module, User Behavioral Profile.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Calculate a "Behavioral Confidence Score" (BCS) based on the deviation of the current feature vector from the user's baseline profile.  A low deviation suggests high confidence in the user’s confirmation.
        *   BCS = 1 - (Deviation Score), where Deviation Score is a weighted average of the differences between current and baseline features.
    *   Adjust the classification confidence threshold dynamically using the BCS.
        *   Adjusted Threshold = Base Threshold + (BCS * Threshold Adjustment Factor)
            *   Base Threshold: The standard confidence threshold.
            *   Threshold Adjustment Factor: A tunable parameter controlling the sensitivity of the threshold adjustment.
*   **Output:** Adjusted confidence threshold.

**4. System Integration:**

*   Integrate the modules into the existing classification pipeline.
*   The Confidence Adjustment Module should operate in parallel with the existing classification confidence scoring.
*   Implement A/B testing to evaluate the performance of the adaptive threshold against the fixed threshold.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Assume existing classification system provides confidence_score

def adjust_threshold(confidence_score, user_id, feature_vector, user_profile, base_threshold, threshold_adjustment_factor):
  # Calculate Deviation Score
  deviation_score = calculate_deviation(feature_vector, user_profile)

  # Calculate Behavioral Confidence Score
  bcs = 1 - deviation_score

  # Adjust Threshold
  adjusted_threshold = base_threshold + (bcs * threshold_adjustment_factor)

  # Determine if manual review is needed
  if confidence_score < adjusted_threshold:
    request_manual_review()

# calculate_deviation function would calculate deviation using existing machine learning techniques
# request_manual_review function would request for user to provide confirmation
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **User Profile:**  {user_id: {feature_1_avg: float, feature_2_std: float, …, anomaly_threshold: float}}
*   **Feature Vector:** {feature_1: float, feature_2: float, …}

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced manual review burden by automatically confirming accurate classifications with high-confidence users.
*   Increased accuracy by triggering manual review for potentially misclassified items, even with moderate confidence scores, for users exhibiting uncertainty.
*   Personalized classification experience.
*   System adaptability over time as user behavior evolves.
