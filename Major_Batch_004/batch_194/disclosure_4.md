**Personalized Recommendation 'Echo' System**

**Concept:** Extend social recommendation beyond direct connections to model 'echoes' of influence. Identify users who consistently recommend similar items to a visitor’s established network, even if not directly connected, and incorporate those recommendations.

**Specs:**

1.  **Influence Mapping Module:**
    *   Input: Visitor’s social network data (connections, interactions). Item interaction data (purchases, views, reviews) of the visitor and their connections. Publicly available item interaction data (all users).
    *   Process:
        *   Calculate ‘similarity scores’ between the visitor’s network and other users based on overlapping item interactions. A weighted system prioritizing recent interactions.
        *   Identify ‘echo users’ – users with high similarity scores *not* directly connected to the visitor or their immediate network.
        *   Assign an ‘echo strength’ based on the similarity score and the number of overlapping interactions.
    *   Output: Ranked list of echo users with their echo strengths.

2.  **Recommendation Blending Engine:**
    *   Input: Recommendations generated from the visitor's direct network (as per existing patent). Ranked list of echo users with strengths. Item interaction data of echo users.
    *   Process:
        *   Blend recommendations from direct network and echo users. Weighting based on echo strength – higher strength, greater weight.
        *   Implement a ‘diversity factor’ to prevent over-representation of items already prominent in the visitor’s network.
    *   Output: Ranked list of blended recommendations.

3.  **Trust Calibration Layer:**
    *   Input: Visitor’s existing trust levels for network connections (as per existing patent). Echo user data (network size, activity level, verification status).
    *   Process:
        *   Assign a preliminary trust level to each echo user. Factors include:
            *   Network size: Larger networks generally indicate more informed opinions.
            *   Activity level: More frequent interaction suggests more relevant recommendations.
            *   Verification status: Verified accounts increase trust.
        *   Allow visitor to calibrate echo user trust levels – adjusting individual weights or grouping users into trust tiers.
    *   Output: Calibrated trust levels for echo users.

4.  **UI Integration:**
    *   Display recommendations clearly differentiated by source – direct network vs. echo users.
    *   Show echo user profiles – network size, activity level, common connections to the visitor.
    *   Provide easy access to calibrate echo user trust levels.
    *   Implement a ‘discovery’ feed focused entirely on recommendations from echo users.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Blending):**

```
function blendRecommendations(directRecs, echoRecs, echoStrengths):
  blendedRecs = []
  for i in range(length(directRecs)):
    blendedRecs.append(directRecs[i])

  for i in range(length(echoRecs)):
    weight = echoStrengths[i] * 0.5 //Adjust 0.5 to control echo influence
    item = echoRecs[i]
    blendedRecs.append(item)  //Duplicate item based on weight
    
  //Apply diversity filter (reduce redundancy)
  uniqueRecs = removeDuplicates(blendedRecs)
  
  return sorted(uniqueRecs, key=relevanceScore)
```
