## Personalized Gift Narrative Generation

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple explanation of *why* an item is recommended and generate a short, personalized narrative *around* the gift, framing it within a hypothetical scenario relevant to the recipient. This goes beyond feature-based explanations and taps into emotional resonance.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Source Expansion:** Augment existing item feature sets (user reviews, metadata) with a "Scenario Library." This library contains templates for short narratives organized by recipient profile (age, relationship to giver, known interests, past gift history).  Example Scenario: "For the avid gardener who loves a cozy evening…" or “To help your niece embrace her budding interest in astronomy…”

2.  **Recipient Profile Integration:** System must maintain (or access) recipient profiles. These profiles contain both explicit preferences (stated interests) and inferred preferences (based on purchase history, social media activity, etc.).

3.  **Narrative Template Selection:** Based on the recipient profile, the system selects the most relevant narrative template from the Scenario Library.  A ranking algorithm (e.g., cosine similarity between recipient interests and scenario keywords) determines template relevance.

4.  **Item Feature Insertion:** The selected narrative template contains placeholders for item features. These placeholders are dynamically populated with relevant attributes of the recommended item. For example: "…this handcrafted birdhouse will add a touch of whimsy to their garden." (birdhouse = item, garden = recipient interest). Use a natural language generation (NLG) model to ensure grammatically correct and coherent insertion.

5.  **Emotional Tone Adjustment:** The NLG model should also include parameters for adjusting the emotional tone of the generated narrative (e.g., playful, sentimental, practical). These parameters should be influenced by the relationship between giver and recipient (e.g., more sentimental for close family members).

6.  **Output Format:** The final output is a short, personalized narrative accompanying the gift recommendation.  Example: “For the avid hiker who loves a challenging trail, this durable backpack will be a welcome companion on their next adventure. Its ergonomic design and waterproof material will ensure they stay comfortable and prepared, no matter the weather.”

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION GenerateGiftNarrative(recipientProfile, itemFeatures):
  // 1. Select Template
  template = SelectBestTemplate(recipientProfile, ScenarioLibrary)

  // 2. Populate Template
  narrative = PopulateTemplate(template, itemFeatures)

  // 3. Adjust Tone
  narrative = AdjustEmotionalTone(narrative, recipientProfile.relationshipToGiver)

  RETURN narrative
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION SelectBestTemplate(recipientProfile, ScenarioLibrary):
  // Calculate similarity score between recipient interests and scenario keywords
  scores = []
  FOR scenario IN ScenarioLibrary:
    score = CalculateSimilarity(recipientProfile.interests, scenario.keywords)
    scores.append((score, scenario))

  // Sort by score and return best scenario
  scores.sort(reverse=True)
  RETURN scores[0].scenario
END FUNCTION
```
