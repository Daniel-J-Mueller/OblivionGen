## Adaptive Acoustic Mapping with Real-Time Environmental Reconstruction

**Concept:** Build a dynamic, localized acoustic map of the environment, not just for speech source localization, but to *reconstruct* a basic “soundscape” understanding. This goes beyond simply finding where sound *is*, and begins to model *what* the sound is interacting with – surfaces, objects, even air currents.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Utilize a distributed microphone array (8-16 mics minimum) embedded within a device (e.g., smart speaker, robot, wearable). Array geometry is adaptable – software dynamically adjusts weighting/focus based on environmental analysis.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Continuous audio capture from all microphones. Sampling rate: 48kHz minimum. Utilize high-dynamic-range (HDR) microphones to capture both quiet and loud sounds accurately.
*   **Beamforming & Localization:** Employ advanced beamforming techniques (e.g., Delay-and-Sum, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response - MVDR) to initially identify potential sound sources. Standardize initial angle of arrival.
*   **Ray Tracing Module:** Crucially, integrate a *simplified* ray tracing module. This doesn’t require a fully detailed 3D model of the room. Instead, utilize the microphone array data *itself* to infer surface positions.
    *   Reflections are detected by analyzing time delays between direct sound and reflected sound. The reflection's angle of arrival and delay is used to infer the reflecting surface's location and orientation.
    *   The ray tracing model does not need to be 'complete'. It focuses on the primary reflections impacting speech clarity.
*   **Environmental Parameter Estimation:** Use the ray tracing data, alongside atmospheric sensors (temperature, humidity, air pressure), to estimate key environmental parameters:
    *   **Reverberation Time (RT60):** Estimated from the ray tracing data and validated with impulse response analysis.
    *   **Surface Material Properties:** Estimate surface absorption/reflection coefficients. This can be done by comparing predicted sound reflections with actual recorded reflections.
    *   **Air Current Modeling:** Use microphone data to detect subtle air currents, which can affect sound propagation. Doppler shift analysis.
*   **Dynamic Acoustic Map Generation:** Build a probabilistic acoustic map.
    *   The map represents sound reflection/absorption characteristics in a localized grid.
    *   The map is updated in real-time as new sound data is received.
*   **AI-Driven Sound Source Classification & Object Recognition:** Train a machine learning model to classify sound sources *and* identify objects based on their acoustic signatures and interactions with the environment. (e.g., differentiating between speech and music, or identifying a glass breaking).
*   **Output:**
    *   A dynamically updating acoustic map (grid-based).
    *   Probabilistic identification of sound sources and objects.
    *   Estimated environmental parameters (RT60, surface properties, air currents).

**Pseudocode (Simplified Map Update):**

```
function updateAcousticMap(audioData, micArrayData):
  // 1. Beamform and localize sound source(s)
  sourceLocation = beamformAndLocalize(audioData, micArrayData)

  // 2. Ray trace to identify potential reflections
  reflections = rayTrace(sourceLocation, micArrayData)

  // 3. For each reflection:
  for reflection in reflections:
    // a. Calculate expected sound intensity based on surface properties
    expectedIntensity = calculateIntensity(reflection.surfaceProperties)

    // b. Compare with actual measured intensity
    intensityDifference = actualIntensity - expectedIntensity

    // c. Update surface properties in acoustic map based on difference
    updateMap(reflection.location, reflection.surfaceProperties, intensityDifference)
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simple source localization. It focuses on *understanding* the acoustic environment itself, enabling applications beyond speech processing (e.g., environmental monitoring, object recognition, assistive technologies). The real-time environmental reconstruction component – using sound itself to map the space – is the key differentiator.
