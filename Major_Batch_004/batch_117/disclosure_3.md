## Dynamic Command Delegation with Predictive Skill Chaining

**Concept:** Expand the core idea of predicting device capability beyond single command execution to *proactive skill chaining* based on predicted user intent and device resource availability. The system doesn’t just decide *if* a device can handle a command, but *which sequence of skills* across multiple devices will most efficiently fulfill a complex user request, and dynamically adjusts this sequence in real-time based on device load and predicted failures.

**System Components:**

*   **Intent Prediction Module:**  Enhanced NLP engine identifying not just the immediate intent, but the *likely sequence* of subsequent intents. Example: "Book a flight to London" – the system predicts likely follow-up intents like "find hotels", "rent a car", or "check the weather".
*   **Device Resource Monitor:** Tracks CPU load, memory usage, network bandwidth, battery life (if applicable) for all networked devices.
*   **Skill Graph:** A constantly updated graph representing available skills on each device, along with their resource requirements and dependencies.
*   **Dynamic Delegation Engine:** The core logic. It analyzes the predicted intent sequence, the Skill Graph, and the Device Resource Monitor to generate an optimal delegation plan. This plan specifies which device executes which skill, in what order, and with what priority.
*   **Predictive Failure Analysis:** Monitors skill execution in real-time. If a device is predicted to fail (based on resource exhaustion, error rates, or network instability), the Delegation Engine automatically re-routes the failing skill to an alternative device.
*   **User Feedback Loop:** Gathers implicit and explicit user feedback to refine intent prediction and delegation strategies.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Delegation Engine):**

```
function delegate_command(user_input):
  intent_sequence = IntentPredictionModule.predict(user_input)
  
  best_plan = null
  lowest_cost = infinity

  for plan in generate_possible_plans(intent_sequence, SkillGraph, DeviceResourceMonitor):
    cost = calculate_plan_cost(plan, DeviceResourceMonitor) 
    if cost < lowest_cost:
      lowest_cost = cost
      best_plan = plan
      
  execute_plan(best_plan)
  
function generate_possible_plans(intent_sequence, skill_graph, device_monitor):
  plans = []
  
  #Recursive function to explore possible skill delegations
  function explore_plan(current_plan, intent_index):
    if intent_index == length(intent_sequence):
      plans.append(current_plan)
      return

    intent = intent_sequence[intent_index]
    eligible_skills = skill_graph.find_skills_for_intent(intent)

    for skill in eligible_skills:
      device = skill.find_best_device(device_monitor) # Considers resource load, network latency
      if device != null:
        new_plan = current_plan + [(skill, device)]
        explore_plan(new_plan, intent_index + 1)
  
  explore_plan([], 0)
  return plans

function calculate_plan_cost(plan, device_monitor):
  cost = 0
  for skill, device in plan:
    cost += skill.resource_requirement + device_monitor.get_latency(device)
  return cost
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems focus on *single-command* delegation. This system proactively plans and dynamically adjusts *skill chains*, anticipating future user needs and proactively mitigating potential failures across a network of devices. It shifts from reactive delegation to proactive orchestration. It also provides a method for weighing device load against the time cost of processing.
