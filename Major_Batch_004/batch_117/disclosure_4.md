## Dynamic Catalog Enrichment via Generative AI & Simulated Customer Interaction

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Modules:**

1.  **AI-Driven Attribute Generator (AAG):**
    *   **Input:** Existing catalog item data (textual descriptions, images, existing attributes).
    *   **Process:** Utilizes a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on e-commerce data to *generate* plausible, missing attributes for existing items.  This isn’t simple keyword extraction, but *predictive attribute creation*.
    *   **Output:** A ranked list of proposed attributes (e.g., “Material: linen,” “Style: Bohemian,” “Occasion: Beach Wedding”). Each attribute includes a confidence score derived from the LLM.
2.  **Simulated Customer Interaction Engine (SCIE):**
    *   **Input:** Existing catalog items, proposed attributes (from AAG), and a "customer profile" (defined by demographics, purchase history, stated preferences - this can be a generalized profile, or a synthesized individual).
    *   **Process:** SCIE simulates a customer browsing the catalog.  It assesses how likely the customer is to interact with an item *with* and *without* the proposed attributes. This is done through a scoring mechanism that accounts for:
        *   **Relevance Score:** How well the proposed attribute matches the customer's profile.
        *   **Discoverability Score:** How much the attribute increases the likelihood of the item appearing in a search or recommendation.
        *   **Engagement Score:**  How likely the attribute is to make the customer click on the item or add it to their cart.
    *   **Output:** A comprehensive "Value Assessment" for each proposed attribute, detailing its potential impact on customer behavior and revenue.

3.  **Automated Catalog Enrichment Manager (ACEM):**
    *   **Input:** Value Assessments from SCIE, confidence scores from AAG, a pre-defined ‘risk tolerance’ threshold (determines how aggressively new attributes are added).
    *   **Process:**  ACEM automatically adds attributes to the catalog based on the following criteria:
        *   High Value Assessment *and* High Confidence Score = Immediate addition.
        *   Moderate Value Assessment *and* High Confidence Score = Addition with A/B testing (expose a small percentage of users to the new attribute).
        *   Low Value Assessment *or* Low Confidence Score = Attribute is flagged for manual review.
    *   **Output:**  Updated catalog data.  Reports detailing the impact of automated enrichment.

**II. Data Structures:**

*   **Item Representation:** JSON object with fields for existing attributes, proposed attributes (with confidence scores), and enrichment history.
*   **Customer Profile:** JSON object with fields for demographics, purchase history, stated preferences, and browsing behavior.
*   **Attribute Knowledge Graph:** A graph database that stores relationships between attributes (e.g., "linen" is a type of "material," "beach wedding" is a type of "occasion"). This graph is used by the AAG to generate plausible attributes and by the SCIE to assess relevance.

**III.  Workflow:**

1.  AAG scans the catalog for items with missing or incomplete attribute data.
2.  AAG generates a list of proposed attributes for each item.
3.  SCIE simulates customer interactions with each item, both with and without the proposed attributes.
4.  SCIE generates a Value Assessment for each proposed attribute.
5.  ACEM automatically adds attributes to the catalog based on the Value Assessment and confidence score.
6.  The system continuously monitors the impact of automated enrichment and adjusts its algorithms accordingly.

**IV. Pseudocode (ACEM Module):**

```
FUNCTION enrichCatalog(itemList) {
  FOR each item IN itemList {
    FOR each proposedAttribute IN item.proposedAttributes {
      IF proposedAttribute.valueAssessment > threshold AND proposedAttribute.confidence > riskTolerance {
        item.attributes.add(proposedAttribute)
        log("Attribute added: " + proposedAttribute.name + " to item: " + item.id)
      } ELSE IF proposedAttribute.valueAssessment > moderateThreshold AND proposedAttribute.confidence > riskTolerance {
        // Implement A/B testing logic
        // Expose attribute to a small percentage of users
        log("Attribute flagged for A/B testing: " + proposedAttribute.name + " to item: " + item.id)
      } ELSE {
        log("Attribute flagged for manual review: " + proposedAttribute.name + " to item: " + item.id)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This system creates a dynamic, self-improving catalog.  The goal is to anticipate customer needs and enhance the discoverability of products, ultimately leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction.
