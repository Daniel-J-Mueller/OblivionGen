## Dynamic Tote Contents Prediction & Pre-Staging

**Concept:** Extend the tote delivery system to *predict* likely tote contents based on customer purchase history, browsing data, and even external factors (weather, local events) to pre-stage items *within* the tote before delivery, maximizing efficiency and customer satisfaction.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Integration Layer:**

*   **Input Sources:**
    *   Customer Purchase History (transactional database)
    *   Customer Browsing History (website/app activity logs)
    *   Wishlists/Saved Items (customer profiles)
    *   Real-time Inventory Levels (warehouse management system)
    *   External Data Feeds (weather APIs, event calendars, social media trends) – optional, for advanced predictions.
*   **Data Processing:**
    *   Machine Learning Model (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approach).  The model is trained to predict the probability of a customer ordering specific items within a defined timeframe (e.g., next 7 days).
    *   Time-Series Analysis – to identify seasonal or recurring purchase patterns.
    *   Weighting Algorithm – to prioritize predictions based on confidence levels and external factors.
*   **Output:** Probabilistic item list for each customer, ranked by likelihood of purchase.  Associated confidence score for each prediction.

**2. Pre-Staging Module (Warehouse/Fulfillment Center):**

*   **Trigger:**  Based on customer’s scheduled tote delivery day (as defined in the existing system) and a pre-defined ‘pre-stage window’ (e.g., 24 hours before delivery).
*   **Item Selection:**  Module retrieves the top N predicted items for the customer (N configurable, based on tote capacity).
*   **Inventory Check:**  Verifies item availability. If an item is unavailable, a substitute item (based on customer preferences or similar items) is considered, or the prediction is flagged for review.
*   **Physical Pre-Staging:** Items are physically placed *within* the designated tote for that customer.  A ‘pre-staged’ flag is associated with each item in the tote record.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   If a customer places a new order *after* the pre-staging window, those items are added to the tote.
    *   If a customer cancels an item that was pre-staged, that item is removed.
    *   Real-time update of tote contents and weight to optimize delivery routes.

**3. Delivery Driver Interface:**

*   **Tote Manifest:** Displays a list of pre-staged items, newly added items, and removed items for each delivery.
*   **Weight Verification:**  Driver scans the tote; system compares the actual weight to the expected weight.  Discrepancies trigger an alert.
*   **Dynamic Route Adjustment:** System can adjust delivery routes in real-time based on changes in tote weight or item availability.

**4. Pseudocode (Pre-Staging Module):**

```
function preStageTote(customerID, deliveryDate):
  predictedItems = getData(customerID, deliveryDate) // Get predicted items from Data Integration Layer
  availableItems = []
  for item in predictedItems:
    if checkInventory(item):
      availableItems.append(item)
  
  toteContents = []
  for item in availableItems:
    toteContents.append(item)
    markItemAsPreStaged(item, toteContents)

  return toteContents
```

**Innovation Focus:**  Shifting from a reactive (deliver what is ordered) to a proactive (anticipate what is desired) delivery system.  Leveraging data to improve efficiency, reduce delivery times, and enhance customer experience. This pushes beyond simply *how* items are delivered, to *what* is delivered, expanding the potential value proposition.
