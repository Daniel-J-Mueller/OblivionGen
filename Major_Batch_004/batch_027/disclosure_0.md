## Adaptive Operation Information Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the *granularity* of collected operation information based on real-time system state and predictive modeling, rather than fixed configurations. The existing patent focuses on *what* information is collected, this builds on that by modulating *how much* detail is captured.

**Specs:**

*   **Granularity Levels:** Define a tiered system of granularity.
    *   **Level 0 (Minimal):** Only essential metadata – timestamps, operation type, success/failure flag.  Lowest overhead.
    *   **Level 1 (Standard):**  Includes parameters, return values, and basic resource usage.
    *   **Level 2 (Detailed):**  Captures stack traces, intermediate values, and full resource profiles. Highest overhead.
*   **Predictive Model:**  A machine learning model trained on historical operation data, resource utilization, and system events. This model predicts upcoming resource contention, potential errors, or performance bottlenecks.
*   **Adaptive Controller:**  A component responsible for adjusting the granularity level for each virtual machine resource (or groups of resources) based on the Predictive Model's output and current system state.  The controller utilizes a feedback loop.
*   **Resource Budgeting:**  Each VM has a configurable "information budget" – a maximum amount of data it can transmit per unit of time. This prevents a single VM from overwhelming the monitoring service.
*   **Configuration Messages:** Extend the existing configuration messages to include a "granularity level" parameter.
*   **Data Compression:** Implement lossless compression algorithms to reduce the bandwidth footprint of detailed operation information.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Controller):**

```
function adjust_granularity(vm_resource, current_granularity):
  predicted_risk = predictive_model.get_risk_score(vm_resource)
  current_usage = vm_resource.get_resource_usage()
  budget_remaining = vm_resource.get_budget_remaining()

  if predicted_risk > threshold_high and budget_remaining > threshold_high:
    new_granularity = 2  // Detailed
  elif predicted_risk > threshold_medium and budget_remaining > threshold_medium:
    new_granularity = 1  // Standard
  else:
    new_granularity = 0  // Minimal

  if new_granularity != current_granularity:
    send_configuration_message(vm_resource, new_granularity)
    current_granularity = new_granularity
    
  return current_granularity
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `VMResource`:  Object representing a virtual machine resource. Includes attributes for resource usage, information budget, current granularity level, and historical data.
*   `ConfigurationMessage`:  Extended message format including a `granularity_level` parameter.
*   `RiskScore`: Numeric score reflecting the predicted likelihood of a resource contention or error event.
