## Dynamic Contextual Clustering for Image Text â€“ Temporal Awareness

**Concept:** Extend the bounding box clustering to incorporate a temporal dimension, tracking text flow *across* multiple frames of a video or a sequence of images. This allows for more accurate reconstruction of paragraphs and logical reading order, especially in situations where individual frames have incomplete or fragmented text.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

1.  **Input:** A video stream or a sequence of images.
2.  **Frame-by-Frame Processing:**  Apply existing bounding box detection and orientation analysis (as described in the provided patent) to each frame. Store bounding box coordinates, orientation vectors, and recognized text for each frame.
3.  **Feature Vector Creation:** For each bounding box, create a feature vector incorporating:
    *   Bounding box coordinates (x, y, width, height)
    *   Orientation vector components
    *   Recognized text (character embeddings or similar)
    *   Frame number (timestamp)
4.  **Optical Flow Integration:**  Compute optical flow between consecutive frames to estimate the movement of potential text regions.  This provides a preliminary association between bounding boxes across frames.

**II. Temporal Clustering Algorithm:**

1.  **Initial Clustering (Frame-Specific):** Perform the clustering process described in the patent *within each frame* to establish initial text segments.
2.  **Inter-Frame Association:**  Calculate a "similarity score" between bounding boxes in consecutive frames based on:
    *   **Proximity:** Distance between the bounding box centers (adjusted for optical flow).
    *   **Orientation Similarity:** Cosine similarity of orientation vectors.
    *   **Textual Similarity:**  Similarity of recognized text (using character embeddings or similar).  Account for potential OCR errors using fuzzy matching.
3.  **Dynamic Graph Construction:**  Construct a dynamic graph where:
    *   Nodes represent bounding boxes across all frames.
    *   Edges connect bounding boxes in consecutive frames with weights corresponding to the similarity score.
4.  **Temporal Path Finding:** Implement a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A*) to identify continuous paths of bounding boxes representing potential lines or paragraphs of text.  Path cost is based on edge weights.  Allow for "jumps" (skips) to handle cases where text is temporarily obscured or fragmented, with a penalty for such jumps. The jump penalty should be based on the difference in the frame number between the jump points.
5.  **Cluster Merging & Refinement:**
    *   Merge clusters along identified paths to form longer text segments.
    *   Apply a filtering step to remove spurious clusters or segments based on length, consistency, and coherence.
    *   Employ a language model (e.g., a recurrent neural network) to evaluate the coherence of assembled text segments and refine the clustering accordingly.

**III. Output & Application:**

1.  **Ordered Text Stream:** Output the recognized text as an ordered stream, representing the logical reading order within the video or image sequence.
2.  **Paragraph Reconstruction:**  Reconstruct paragraphs based on the identified text segments.
3.  **Applications:**  Video subtitling, document scanning (from video), intelligent video analysis, and automated document reconstruction.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// For each frame:
DetectBoundingBoxes(frame)
ExtractText(frame)
CreateFeatureVectors(bounding_boxes)
InitialCluster(bounding_boxes)

// Across frames:
For each bounding box in current frame:
    Find potential matches in next frame based on proximity, orientation, and text similarity
    Calculate similarity score
    Add edge to dynamic graph

For each bounding box in first frame:
    Run A* pathfinding algorithm on dynamic graph to find continuous path of bounding boxes
    Merge clusters along path
    Apply filtering and language model refinement

Output ordered text stream and reconstructed paragraphs
