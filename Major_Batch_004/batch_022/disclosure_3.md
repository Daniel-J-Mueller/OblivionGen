## Dynamic Sensor Persona & Behavioral Profiling

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple IP address threat identification. Create sensors with dynamically shifting “personas” and leverage behavioral profiling of these personas within the network to detect anomalies indicative of malicious activity, even from previously unknown sources.

**Specification:**

**I. Persona Definition & Assignment:**

*   **Persona Library:** Maintain a library of pre-defined sensor personas. Each persona represents a typical user profile (e.g., “Marketing Analyst,” “Software Developer,” “Database Administrator”).  Each persona is defined by:
    *   Expected network traffic patterns (protocols, ports, frequency).
    *   File access patterns (types of files, frequency, locations).
    *   Common application usage.
    *   Expected system resource utilization.
*   **Dynamic Assignment:**  Instead of static sensor deployment, dynamically assign personas to sensors based on the virtual machine/compute resource they are attached to *and* on simulated user activity. The activity simulation is critical – it isn’t enough to know the VM is running an analytics tool; the sensor needs to *mimic* typical user interaction with that tool.
*   **Persona Blending:** Introduce the ability to "blend" personas, creating sensors that exhibit characteristics of multiple profiles. This increases the realism and makes it harder for attackers to predict sensor behavior.  Blend weights are dynamically adjusted based on observed network behavior.

**II. Behavioral Baseline & Anomaly Detection:**

*   **Continuous Profiling:** Sensors continuously monitor their own behavior (network traffic, file access, resource usage) and establish a baseline for their assigned persona.
*   **Deviation Scoring:**  Any deviation from the established baseline is assigned a deviation score.  The scoring algorithm must account for both the *magnitude* and *frequency* of the deviation.  Small, infrequent deviations are ignored.
*   **Contextual Analysis:** Deviation scores are analyzed in context. For example, a sudden spike in outbound traffic might be normal for a data backup process but suspicious for a web server.
*   **Behavioral Chains:**  Identify “behavioral chains” – sequences of actions that are characteristic of specific attack patterns.  For example: “reconnaissance scan -> vulnerability exploit -> data exfiltration.”

**III. Implementation Details (Pseudocode):**

```
// Sensor Initialization
sensor = new Sensor(vm_id, persona_library);
persona = persona_library.select_persona(vm_id); // Select initial persona
sensor.activate(persona);

// Continuous Monitoring Loop
while (sensor.is_active()) {
  network_activity = sensor.capture_network_activity();
  file_access = sensor.capture_file_access();
  resource_usage = sensor.capture_resource_usage();

  deviation_score = sensor.calculate_deviation(network_activity, file_access, resource_usage);

  if (deviation_score > threshold) {
    //Anomalous activity detected
    threat_info = generate_threat_information(deviation_score);
    report_threat(threat_info);
  }

  //Dynamically adjust persona weights based on observed behavior
  sensor.update_persona_weights();
}
```

**IV. Advanced Features:**

*   **Deception Technology Integration:**  Sensors can be configured to present “honeypots” or deceptive information to attackers, luring them into revealing their methods.
*   **Adaptive Persona Morphing:**  If an attacker attempts to profile or evade a sensor, the sensor can dynamically “morph” its persona, changing its behavior to remain undetected.
*   **Federated Learning:** Share behavioral profiles across multiple organizations without revealing sensitive data, creating a more comprehensive threat intelligence network.
