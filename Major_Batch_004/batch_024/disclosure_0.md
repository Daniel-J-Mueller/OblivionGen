## Dynamic Temporal Phrase Landscapes

**Concept:** Extend the visual representation of phrases beyond static or dynamically updating frequency/source counts to incorporate *temporal* data, creating a “phrase landscape” that evolves over time, revealing shifts in topic prominence and emerging trends.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Processing:**

*   **Data Sources:** Monitor document sources as per existing patent.
*   **Temporal Tagging:** Each extracted phrase instance is tagged with a timestamp reflecting its appearance in the source document.
*   **Time Binning:**  Divide the monitored period into configurable time bins (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly).
*   **Temporal Frequency Calculation:** For each phrase and time bin, calculate a ‘Temporal Relevance Score’ (TRS). TRS is not merely frequency, but a weighted score. Recent bins receive higher weights.  Formula:
    `TRS(phrase, time_bin) = Σ [frequency(phrase, bin_i) * weight(bin_i)]` where `bin_i` iterates through time bins and `weight(bin_i)` decreases exponentially with the age of `bin_i`.
*   **Trend Detection:**  Implement a moving average or similar algorithm to calculate the *rate of change* of the TRS for each phrase. Positive rates indicate trending phrases, negative rates indicate fading phrases.

**2. Visual Representation: The Phrase Landscape**

*   **Base Landscape:**  A 2D or 3D space represents the conceptual “landscape”.  Phrases are represented as topographical features – ‘hills’ or ‘peaks’.
*   **Height = Relevance:** The height of a topographical feature (peak/hill) representing a phrase corresponds to its current TRS. Higher peaks indicate greater relevance.
*   **Color = Trend:**  Color-code topographical features to indicate trend:
    *   Green:  Positive trend (increasing relevance)
    *   Red: Negative trend (decreasing relevance)
    *   Yellow/Orange:  Stable/Neutral trend
*   **Temporal Animation:**  The landscape dynamically evolves over time.  The TRS and trend calculations are updated at a configurable interval. Topographical features rise and fall, change color, and shift position to reflect these changes.
*   **Interactive Exploration:**
    *   **Time Slider:** Users can scrub through time using a slider to view the landscape at different points in the past.
    *   **Zoom/Pan:**  Standard zoom and pan functionality for exploring the landscape.
    *   **Phrase Selection:** Clicking on a topographical feature highlights the corresponding phrase and displays detailed information (e.g., source documents, TRS over time).
    *    **Filtering:**  Users can filter phrases by category, source, or other criteria.

**3.  Pseudocode – Landscape Update Cycle:**

```pseudocode
FOR each time interval:
    FOR each phrase:
        Calculate TRS(phrase, current time bin)
        Calculate Trend(phrase) // Using moving average or similar
        Update Landscape Feature(phrase):
            Set Height = TRS(phrase)
            Set Color = Trend(phrase)

    Redraw Landscape // Efficiently update only changed features
END
```

**4.  Advanced Features:**

*   **Semantic Relationships:**  Connect phrases with similar meanings using visual links or proximity in the landscape.  This could use word embeddings or other semantic analysis techniques.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Highlight unusual spikes or dips in the TRS for specific phrases, potentially indicating breaking news or emerging crises.
*   **Prediction:**  Implement a predictive model to forecast future trends based on historical data.  Visualizations could show “potential peaks” or “projected declines.”
*   **Multi-Source Comparison:**  Overlay landscapes from different document sources to compare topic prominence across different domains.
