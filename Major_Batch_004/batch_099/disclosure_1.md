## Dynamic Predictive Jitter Buffer with Per-Stream Adaptation

**Concept:** Instead of a single, globally adjusted jitter buffer, implement a system of *multiple*, smaller, dynamically predictive jitter buffers, one for each audio stream (e.g., each participant in a conference call). These buffers aren't just reactive to queuing delays; they *predict* them based on historical stream-specific network conditions.

**Specs:**

*   **Per-Stream Buffer Allocation:** Each incoming audio stream is assigned a dedicated, initially small, jitter buffer. Memory allocation is dynamic, allowing for growth/shrinkage based on observed conditions. Initial size: 10ms.
*   **Network Condition Monitoring:**  Implement a lightweight network probe that periodically (e.g., every 50ms) sends small UDP packets to each stream's source.  Measure Round Trip Time (RTT), packet loss, and jitter.  Store a rolling window (e.g., 5 minutes) of this data per stream.
*   **Predictive Modeling:**  Employ a simple time series forecasting model (e.g., Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA(1,0,0)) *per stream* to predict future RTT and jitter. The model's output is a predicted RTT/Jitter value for the *next* 100ms.
*   **Dynamic Buffer Adjustment:**
    *   **Target Buffer Size:** Calculate a target buffer size *per stream* based on the predicted RTT/Jitter.  Formula: `Target Buffer Size = Predicted RTT + (2 * Predicted Jitter)`.  The multiplier on jitter allows for some headroom.
    *   **Proactive Adjustment:** Continuously adjust the buffer size *proactively* towards the target size.  Use a smoothing factor (e.g., 0.1) to avoid aggressive oscillations.  Formula: `New Buffer Size = (0.9 * Current Buffer Size) + (0.1 * Target Buffer Size)`.
    *   **Minimum/Maximum Limits:** Enforce a minimum buffer size (e.g., 5ms) and a maximum buffer size (e.g., 200ms) to prevent extreme values.
*   **Stream Prioritization:** Implement a quality-of-service (QoS) mechanism.  Allow the system to prioritize certain streams (e.g., the current speaker in a conference call) by allocating them a larger buffer or giving their predictions higher weight.
*   **Fallback Mechanism:** If a stream experiences prolonged packet loss or consistently inaccurate predictions, fall back to a larger, more conservative buffer size to ensure audio continuity, at the expense of latency.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `StreamInfo`: A structure containing:
        *   `streamID`: Unique identifier for the stream.
        *   `bufferSize`: Current jitter buffer size (in milliseconds).
        *   `RTT_history`: Rolling window of RTT measurements.
        *   `jitter_history`: Rolling window of jitter measurements.
        *   `prediction_model`: Trained time series forecasting model.
        *   `priority`: Stream priority level.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
For each incoming audio packet:
  streamID = packet.streamID
  streamInfo = getStreamInfo(streamID)

  If streamInfo is null:
    initializeStreamInfo(streamID)
    streamInfo = getStreamInfo(streamID)

  currentBufferSize = streamInfo.bufferSize

  predictedRTT = streamInfo.prediction_model.predict()
  predictedJitter = streamInfo.prediction_model.predictJitter()
  targetBufferSize = predictedRTT + (2 * predictedJitter)

  newBufferSize = (0.9 * currentBufferSize) + (0.1 * targetBufferSize)
  newBufferSize = clamp(newBufferSize, 5, 200) // Enforce limits
  streamInfo.bufferSize = newBufferSize

  storePacketInBuffer(packet, streamInfo.bufferSize)

  If buffer is full:
    playAudioFromBuffer()
```

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond a single, global buffer by adapting to individual stream characteristics and predicting future network conditions. This has the potential to significantly reduce latency while maintaining robust audio quality, even in challenging network environments.  The stream prioritization feature adds another layer of control for optimizing the user experience.
