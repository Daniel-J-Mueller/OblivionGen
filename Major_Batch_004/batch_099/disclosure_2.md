## Adaptive Stroke Width Mapping for Dynamic Script Recognition

**Concept:** Extend the stroke width analysis to incorporate dynamic adjustments based on contextual glyph similarity, aiming for improved recognition of handwritten or stylistically varied scripts. The existing patent focuses on static stroke width variation *within* a potential glyph region. This expands that to compare stroke widths *between* glyphs, and adapt the analysis based on the learned relationships.

**Specs:**

1.  **Glyph Embedding Module:**
    *   Input: Isolated potential glyph region (as determined by MSER or similar).
    *   Process: Generate a high-dimensional embedding vector representing the glyph's shape and stroke characteristics using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pre-trained on a diverse dataset of scripts.  Output a 256-dimensional vector.
    *   Output: Glyph embedding vector.

2.  **Stroke Width Feature Extraction (Extended):**
    *   Input: Potential glyph region, point cloud derived from scan line intersections (as in the base patent).
    *   Process:  Calculate shortest segment lengths as described in the patent.  Additionally, calculate a ‘stroke orientation’ vector for each point based on the dominant direction of the scan segments intersecting that point.
    *   Output:  For each point: shortest segment length, stroke orientation vector.

3.  **Similarity Graph Construction:**
    *   Input:  Set of potential glyph regions, corresponding glyph embedding vectors.
    *   Process:  Construct a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) graph. Each node represents a glyph, and edges connect similar glyphs (based on cosine similarity of their embedding vectors).  'k' is a tunable parameter (default = 10).  Edge weights represent the similarity score.

4.  **Adaptive Stroke Width Parameter Calculation:**
    *   Input:  Glyph embedding vector for the current glyph, k-NN graph, stroke width data for the current glyph.
    *   Process:
        *   Identify the 'k' nearest neighbors of the current glyph in the k-NN graph.
        *   For each neighbor:
            *   Calculate the mean and standard deviation of shortest segment lengths within that neighbor's glyph region.
        *   Calculate a weighted average of these mean and standard deviation values, using the edge weights from the k-NN graph as the weighting factors.  This produces an 'adaptive mean' and 'adaptive standard deviation' for the current glyph.
    *   Output: Adaptive mean, Adaptive standard deviation.

5.  **Glyph Classification:**
    *   Input: Stroke width parameters (mean, standard deviation, adaptive mean, adaptive standard deviation), potentially MSER features as in the base patent.
    *   Process: Train a classifier (SVM, Neural Network, Random Forest) using these parameters. The classifier outputs a probability score indicating whether the region contains a valid glyph. The MSER features can be incorporated as additional inputs to the classifier.
    *   Output: Glyph probability score.

**Pseudocode (Glyph Classification):**

```
function classifyGlyph(glyphRegion, MSER_features):
    strokeWidthParams = calculateStrokeWidthParams(glyphRegion)  //mean, stdDev
    adaptiveParams = calculateAdaptiveParams(glyphRegion) //adaptiveMean, adaptiveStdDev
    inputFeatures = [strokeWidthParams.mean, strokeWidthParams.stdDev, adaptiveParams.adaptiveMean, adaptiveParams.adaptiveStdDev] + MSER_features
    probability = classifier.predict(inputFeatures)
    return probability
```

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond static stroke width analysis by leveraging contextual information about similar glyphs to refine the parameters used for classification. This allows the system to adapt to variations in handwriting style, font design, and image quality.  It effectively learns a prior distribution over stroke widths based on observed glyphs, improving robustness and accuracy.
