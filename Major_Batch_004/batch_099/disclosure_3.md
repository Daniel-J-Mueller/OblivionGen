## Dynamic Key Derivation via Biometric Entropy

**Concept:** Augment the hierarchical encryption system with dynamic key derivation tied to biometric data, specifically leveraging the inherent entropy of physiological signals to generate or refresh encryption keys. This introduces a layer of security beyond static key management and allows for adaptive key strength based on real-time biometric verification.

**Specifications:**

**1. Biometric Sensor Integration:**

*   **Supported Modalities:** Electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and photoplethysmography (PPG). These offer a balance of accessibility, continuous monitoring capability, and entropy potential.
*   **Sensor Hardware:** Integrate with commercially available wearable biometric sensors (smartwatches, chest straps, etc.) via Bluetooth or USB.
*   **Data Acquisition Rate:** Minimum 128 Hz for each supported modality. Higher rates preferred for increased entropy.

**2. Entropy Extraction Module:**

*   **Preprocessing:** Raw biometric signals will be filtered (noise reduction, baseline wander correction) and segmented into consistent time windows (e.g., 5 seconds).
*   **Entropy Calculation:** Apply non-linear dynamical systems analysis (e.g., Approximate Entropy, Sample Entropy, or Permutation Entropy) to the preprocessed biometric data.
*   **Entropy Pooling:** Combine entropy values from different biometric modalities to create a unified entropy pool. A weighted average or maximum entropy selection could be employed.

**3. Key Derivation Function (KDF):**

*   **KDF Algorithm:** Utilize a strong KDF (e.g., HKDF, PBKDF2) that accepts entropy data as input.
*   **Key Derivation Process:**
    1.  Capture biometric data from the user.
    2.  Extract entropy from the biometric data.
    3.  Use the entropy as a seed or input to the KDF.
    4.  Derive a session key or refresh an existing key.
    5.  Encrypt/Decrypt data using the derived key.

**4. Hierarchical Key Management Integration:**

*   **Key Hierarchy:** Integrate the dynamically derived session keys into the existing hierarchical key structure. Session keys could be used to encrypt lower-level data portions, while higher-level keys remain static.
*   **Key Rotation:** Implement a key rotation schedule based on entropy availability or a time-based trigger.
*   **Fallback Mechanism:** In the event of biometric sensor failure or insufficient entropy, provide a fallback to a static key or password-based authentication.

**5. System Architecture:**

```
[Biometric Sensor(s)] --> [Entropy Extraction Module] --> [KDF] --> [Hierarchical Key Management System] --> [Data Encryption/Decryption]
```

**Pseudocode - Key Derivation:**

```
function deriveKey(biometricData, masterKey):
  entropy = calculateEntropy(biometricData)
  salt = generateRandomSalt()
  derivedKey = HKDF(masterKey, salt, entropy)
  return derivedKey
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Adaptive Entropy Thresholds:** Adjust entropy thresholds based on user activity level or environmental factors.
*   **Biometric Fusion:** Combine multiple biometric modalities to increase entropy and security.
*   **Adversarial Training:** Train the entropy extraction module to resist attacks designed to spoof biometric signals.
*   **Key Attestation:** Implement a key attestation mechanism to verify the integrity of the derived keys.
