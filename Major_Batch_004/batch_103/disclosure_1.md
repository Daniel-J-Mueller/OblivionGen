## Dynamic Environmental Mapping & Predictive Trajectory System

**Core Concept:** Augment the overhead camera system with real-time environmental mapping and predictive trajectory analysis to anticipate user movements and proactively adjust data collection/tracking parameters. This moves beyond reactive tracking to a preventative/proactive system.

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Existing Overhead Camera Array (as per provided patent) – serves as primary tracking input.
    *   Lidar/Depth Sensors: Integrated with camera housings, providing a 3D point cloud of the facility environment. Resolution: 5cm accuracy at 10m range. Field of View: 90 degrees vertical/horizontal.
    *   Ultrasonic/Infrared Proximity Sensors: Distributed throughout the facility (especially near potential obstacles/chokepoints). Range: 1-5m.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance server cluster with dedicated GPU acceleration.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Environmental Mapping Module:*
        *   Input: Lidar/Depth sensor data, Ultrasonic/Infrared sensor data.
        *   Process: Creates and maintains a dynamic 3D map of the facility. Identifies static obstacles, dynamic obstacles (e.g., forklifts), and navigable pathways. Map updated continuously (5Hz).
        *   Output: Dynamic 3D map data.
    *   *Trajectory Prediction Module:*
        *   Input: Historical user movement data (collected by existing system), Current user position (from cameras), Dynamic 3D map data, Obstacle locations.
        *   Process: Utilizes machine learning (Recurrent Neural Network preferred) to predict likely user trajectories. Models consider speed, direction, proximity to obstacles, and historical patterns. Generates multiple trajectory probabilities.
        *   Output: Predicted trajectory probabilities (confidence levels associated with each potential path).
    *   *Camera Control Module:*
        *   Input: Predicted trajectory probabilities, Current user position, Camera field of view data.
        *   Process: Dynamically adjusts camera focus, zoom, and pan to maintain optimal tracking of the user along the most likely trajectory. Preemptive camera adjustment anticipates the user's movement.
        *   Output: Camera control signals.
    *   *Data Prioritization Module:*
        *   Input: Predicted trajectory probabilities, Camera data stream.
        *   Process: Prioritizes data processing and storage based on predicted trajectory. Areas along the most likely path receive higher processing priority. Reduced data processing for areas outside the likely path.
        *   Output: Prioritized data stream.

**Pseudocode (Camera Control Module):**

```
FUNCTION adjustCamera(predictedTrajectories, userPosition, cameraFOV)
  // predictedTrajectories is a list of (trajectory, confidence) tuples
  // userPosition is the current (x, y) coordinates of the user
  // cameraFOV is the field of view of the camera

  // Calculate the center point of the highest confidence trajectory
  predictedCenter = calculateCenter(predictedTrajectories[0][0])

  // Calculate the angle between the user's current position and the predicted center
  angle = calculateAngle(userPosition, predictedCenter)

  // Calculate the required pan adjustment
  panAdjustment = angle - currentPan

  // Limit pan adjustment to prevent excessive movement
  panAdjustment = clamp(panAdjustment, -maxPanSpeed, maxPanSpeed)

  // Apply pan adjustment
  currentPan = currentPan + panAdjustment

  // Adjust zoom based on distance to predicted center
  distanceToCenter = calculateDistance(userPosition, predictedCenter)
  zoomLevel = calculateZoom(distanceToCenter)

  // Apply zoom level
  setZoom(zoomLevel)

  // Return updated camera parameters
  RETURN (currentPan, zoomLevel)
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**

This goes beyond simple tracking to *anticipate* movement. By proactively adjusting the camera and prioritizing data, it optimizes tracking accuracy, reduces processing load, and provides a more responsive system. The predictive element allows for tracking even if the user is momentarily obscured or moves quickly, and significantly reduces latency. It moves from “where is the user” to “where will the user be”.
