## Adaptive Chassis Power & Cooling Distribution

**Concept:** Extend the interposer card functionality to dynamically manage power and cooling resources *within* the server chassis, allocating them based on workload demands of individual components *and* coordinating with the cloud service provider network for optimal efficiency.

**Specifications:**

*   **Interposer Card Enhancement:** Integrate a power distribution network (PDN) controller and a thermal management unit (TMU) into the interposer card design.
*   **PDN Controller:**
    *   Multiple, individually controlled power rails.
    *   Real-time monitoring of power consumption per component (CPU, GPU, NVMe, etc.).
    *   Dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS) control for individual components, coordinated with the BMC.
    *   Power capping capabilities per component, configurable via the cloud provider network.
    *   Support for various power supply topologies (ATX, DC power).
*   **TMU:**
    *   Multiple temperature sensors strategically placed within the chassis.
    *   Control of chassis fans, liquid cooling pumps, and other cooling devices.
    *   Adaptive fan speed control algorithms based on component temperatures and workload.
    *   Liquid cooling zone control (if applicable).
    *   Thermal throttling override capabilities (configurable via the cloud provider).
*   **Communication Protocol:** Implement a dedicated, high-speed communication channel between the interposer card, the network virtualization offloading card, and the server’s BMC.  This channel should support:
    *   Real-time power and temperature data streaming.
    *   Control commands for PDN and TMU.
    *   Telemetry data for cloud provider analytics.
*   **Software Interface:** Expose a REST API on the interposer card’s BMC for cloud provider network integration. This API should allow the cloud provider to:
    *   Monitor power and temperature data.
    *   Set power limits.
    *   Configure cooling profiles.
    *   Receive alerts on thermal events.
*   **Chassis Integration:** Require modifications to server chassis to support additional power and thermal sensors, as well as potentially different fan configurations.

**Pseudocode (Interposer Card BMC):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Receive commands from Cloud Provider Network
  command = receiveCloudCommand();

  if (command == "getTelemetry") {
    // Collect power and temperature data from PDN and TMU
    telemetryData = collectTelemetry();
    sendTelemetry(telemetryData);
  } else if (command == "setPowerLimit") {
    componentID = command.componentID;
    powerLimit = command.powerLimit;
    setPowerLimit(componentID, powerLimit);
  } else if (command == "setCoolingProfile") {
    profileID = command.profileID;
    setCoolingProfile(profileID);
  }
}

// Function: setPowerLimit(componentID, powerLimit)
// Sets the maximum power consumption for a specific component.
if (componentID == "CPU") {
    adjustCPUVoltageAndFrequency(powerLimit);
} else if (componentID == "GPU") {
    adjustGPUClockSpeedAndVoltage(powerLimit);
}

// Function: setCoolingProfile(profileID)
// Applies a predefined cooling profile.
if (profileID == "HighPerformance") {
    setFanSpeed(100%);
} else if (profileID == "EnergySaving") {
    setFanSpeed(30%);
}
```

This system allows the cloud provider to fine-tune server power and cooling resources on a granular level, optimizing for performance, energy efficiency, and cost savings. It moves beyond simple rack-level management to enable *in-chassis* resource control.
