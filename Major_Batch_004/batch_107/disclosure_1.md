## Autonomous Vehicle Swarm Topology Mapping & Predictive Negotiation

**Concept:** Extend the strategy mode determination to incorporate swarm intelligence principles, enabling autonomous vehicles to not only *react* to each other’s modes but proactively *negotiate* optimal paths and strategies based on predicted future states and topological constraints, creating a dynamically optimized swarm topology.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Swarm Topology Mapper (STM):** A distributed system running on each autonomous vehicle.  STM maintains a local map of nearby vehicles and the environment, enhanced with predicted trajectories (see section 2).
*   **Negotiation Engine (NE):**  Integrated with the STM.  Responsible for initiating and managing negotiation sessions with nearby vehicles.
*   **Predictive Modeling Unit (PMU):** Core component.  Utilizes historical data, sensor input, and environmental factors to predict the future state (position, velocity, intended maneuvers, strategy mode) of nearby vehicles and potential environmental changes.
*   **Communication Module:** Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication capability utilizing a secure, low-latency protocol (e.g., 5G, dedicated short-range communication).

**2. Predictive Modeling & Negotiation Process:**

1.  **State Estimation:** Each vehicle's PMU continuously estimates the state of nearby vehicles using sensor data (LIDAR, radar, cameras) and V2V/V2I communication.
2.  **Trajectory Prediction:**  PMU predicts future trajectories of nearby vehicles using:
    *   Kalman Filtering/Particle Filtering for short-term prediction.
    *   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) – trained on historical driving data for long-term prediction, considering common driving patterns and route preferences.  Input features include vehicle type, velocity, acceleration, heading, surrounding environment, and destination (if known).
    *   Game Theory models to predict rational maneuvers in complex scenarios (e.g., merging, lane changes).
3.  **Conflict Detection:** STM identifies potential conflicts based on predicted trajectories.
4.  **Negotiation Initiation:**  If a conflict is detected, the initiating vehicle sends a negotiation request to the conflicting vehicle(s), including:
    *   Predicted trajectories.
    *   Preferred strategy mode.
    *   Potential alternative maneuvers.
5.  **Negotiation Protocol:**
    *   A distributed auction-based protocol. Vehicles “bid” on optimal maneuvers by proposing adjusted trajectories and associated costs (e.g., time delay, energy consumption, safety risk).
    *   A cost function considers multiple factors: travel time, energy efficiency, safety, passenger comfort, and adherence to traffic rules.
    *   Vehicles iteratively refine their bids until a mutually acceptable solution is reached (consensus is achieved).
6.  **Strategy Mode Adjustment:** Based on the negotiation outcome, each vehicle adjusts its strategy mode and trajectory accordingly. The STM updates the swarm topology map to reflect the changes.

**3.  Data Requirements:**

*   **High-resolution maps:** Detailed maps including lane markings, traffic signs, and road geometry.
*   **Historical driving data:** Large datasets of driving behavior in various scenarios to train the predictive models.
*   **Real-time traffic information:** Data from traffic management centers and other sources.
*   **Vehicle performance data:**  Information about the capabilities and limitations of each vehicle (e.g., acceleration, braking distance).

**4. Pseudocode (Negotiation Engine – Simplified):**

```pseudocode
function negotiate(conflictingVehicles, preferredStrategy):
  myTrajectory = predictMyTrajectory()
  for each vehicle in conflictingVehicles:
    vehicleTrajectory = vehicle.predictTrajectory()
    if trajectoriesConflict(myTrajectory, vehicleTrajectory):
      bid = calculateBid(myTrajectory, vehicleTrajectory, preferredStrategy)
      vehicle.receiveBid(bid)
      vehicle.calculateCounterBid(myTrajectory, bid)
      //Iterate until a mutually agreeable solution is reached.
      if (counterbid is acceptable):
          // Accept vehicle’s counterbid and adjust own trajectory
          myTrajectory = vehicle.counterbid.trajectory
          break
      else:
          // Increase bid or terminate negotiation
          bid = increaseBid(bid)
```

**5.  Novelty:**  

This goes beyond simple reactive strategy mode determination and introduces proactive negotiation, leveraging swarm intelligence and predictive modeling to optimize the collective behavior of autonomous vehicles, and creating a resilient and efficient transportation system. This allows for a more fluid and natural flow of traffic, particularly in complex scenarios.
