## Decentralized Autonomous Document Revision History (DADRH)

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of blockchain-based work product verification to create a fully decentralized, autonomously revising document system. Instead of snapshots *at* time intervals, the system continuously records *differences* and applies them in a verifiable, auditable manner.  This moves beyond simple proof of existence to a functional, evolving document.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A 'Differential Hash Tree' (DHT).  Each document is represented by a DHT.  The root hash of the DHT represents the current document state.
*   **Revision Units:** All document changes are broken down into minimal 'Revision Units' (RUs). An RU could be a single character change, a paragraph re-arrangement, or an image replacement.
*   **RU Submission:**  RUs are submitted to a blockchain network.  Each RU includes:
    *   Document ID.
    *   Parent DHT Root Hash (hash of the DHT *before* the RU was applied).
    *   RU Data (the specific change).
    *   Timestamp.
    *   Digital Signature of the submitting user.
*   **DHT Application Engine:** A network of nodes (potentially run by document collaborators) responsible for applying RUs to DHTs.
    *   Nodes verify RU validity (signature, timestamp, parent hash match).
    *   Nodes apply the RU to a *local copy* of the DHT.
    *   Nodes broadcast the new DHT root hash.
    *   Nodes participate in a consensus mechanism to determine the ‘canonical’ DHT root hash (e.g., a weighted voting system based on reputation or stake).
*   **Conflict Resolution:** A smart contract-based system to resolve conflicting RUs.  
    *   If multiple RUs target the same section of a document, the smart contract automatically applies the latest timestamped, valid RU.
    *   If conflicts persist, a dispute resolution mechanism is triggered, potentially involving human arbitrators.
*   **Versioning & Rollback:**  The blockchain provides a complete, immutable history of all RUs. Users can easily revert to any previous version of the document by re-applying RUs up to a specific point in time.
*   **Access Control:** Document access and modification permissions are managed through smart contracts.

**Pseudocode (DHT Application Engine):**

```
function applyRevisionUnit(ru: RevisionUnit): boolean {
  // Verify ru signature and timestamp
  if (!verify(ru)) {
    return false;
  }

  // Fetch current DHT root hash
  currentRootHash = getDHTRootHash(ru.documentId);

  // Check parent hash
  if (currentRootHash != ru.parentRootHash) {
    // Revision unit is based on an outdated version
    return false;
  }

  // Apply RU to local DHT
  newRootHash = applyRU(localDHT, ru);

  // Broadcast new DHT root hash
  broadcast(newRootHash);

  // Update local DHT
  localDHT = applyRU(localDHT, ru);

  return true;
}

function applyRU(dht: DHT, ru: RevisionUnit): DHT {
  // Logic to apply the revision unit to the DHT
  // (Specific implementation depends on the DHT data structure)
  // Example: Apply character change to a specific node in the DHT
  // ...
  return updatedDHT;
}
```

**Innovation:**  This system moves beyond simple verification to a fully functional, collaboratively evolving document. It facilitates granular revision tracking, conflict resolution, and auditable history. The DHT structure allows for efficient updates and retrieval of document content.  It creates a 'living' document, verifiable at *any* point in time, not just at discrete intervals.
