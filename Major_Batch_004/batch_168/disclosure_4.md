## Modular Power System with Wireless Data Transmission

**Concept:** Expand the interchangeable head concept into a fully modular power system, incorporating wireless data transmission for power usage monitoring and dynamic power allocation.

**Specs:**

*   **Power Hub:** A central unit containing the primary power conversion circuitry, a microcontroller, a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module, and a standardized docking interface.
*   **Modular Heads:** Interchangeable heads, each containing a unique prong configuration for different regional power outlets, *and* a secondary communication chip.  These chips establish a secure, low-bandwidth connection with the Power Hub upon docking.
*   **Modular Cables:** A series of cables with standardized connectors. These cables can vary in length, gauge (for different power demands), and material (for durability/flexibility).  Each cable contains a passive RFID tag for identification.
*   **Smart Prongs:**  Prongs themselves are capacitive touch sensors. User touch allows for basic control via a mobile app (e.g., 'enable/disable' the head).
*   **Wireless Data Transmission Protocol:** Secure, encrypted data packets transmitted between the modular heads, cables (RFID data read by the hub), and the Power Hub.  Data includes:
    *   Voltage and Current draw of the connected device.
    *   Head identification (prong type/region).
    *   Cable characteristics (gauge, length).
    *   Head temperature (for safety monitoring).
*   **Dynamic Power Allocation:** The Power Hub intelligently distributes power based on the combined demands of all connected devices and the capabilities of the connected cables. This prevents overloads and optimizes energy efficiency.
*   **Mobile App Integration:**  A mobile app provides:
    *   Real-time power usage monitoring per device.
    *   Historical power usage data.
    *   Remote enable/disable of individual heads.
    *   Alerts for excessive power draw or potential hazards.
    *   Automatic selection of optimal cable based on device power needs (integrated with cable RFID data).
*   **Safety Features:**
    *   Over-current protection.
    *   Over-temperature protection.
    *   Ground fault detection.
    *   Tamper detection (if a non-approved modular head is connected).
*   **Physical Design:**
    *   Modular heads are constructed from a durable, flame-retardant plastic.
    *   All connectors are gold-plated for corrosion resistance.
    *   The Power Hub has a sleek, modern design.
*   **Power Hub Firmware/Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
Connect to Wi-Fi
Initialize Bluetooth
RFID Reader Init()
Set Default Power Allocation (e.g. 5A per port)

//Main Loop
Read RFID Data from Connected Cables
Read Power Usage Data from Modular Heads
Calculate Total Power Draw
IF Total Power Draw > Max Power Capacity THEN
  Reduce Power Allocation to Individual Ports (Prioritize based on user preferences/device type)
  Send Alert to Mobile App
ENDIF
Update Mobile App with Real-Time Power Usage Data
Check for User Commands (via Mobile App)
  IF User Requests to Disable Port THEN
    Disable Port
  ENDIF
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Travel Adapters: A single Power Hub with a variety of modular heads for different countries.
*   Home Power Management: A centralized power system for homes, allowing users to monitor and control energy usage.
*   Industrial Power Systems:  A robust and flexible power system for industrial applications.
*   Emergency Power Systems: A modular power system that can be quickly deployed in emergency situations.
