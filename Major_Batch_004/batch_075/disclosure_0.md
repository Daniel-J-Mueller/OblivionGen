## Automated Governance Rule Synthesis from Natural Language & Observational Data

**Concept:** A system that dynamically generates governance requirement rules based on natural language descriptions of desired outcomes *and* observational data from the provider network. This moves beyond static rule definitions to adaptive governance.

**Specification:**

**1. Components:**

*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engine:**  Accepts natural language input (e.g., "Ensure all database instances are encrypted at rest," "Prevent public access to sensitive customer data"). Translates this into a preliminary rule structure (e.g., condition: resource type = database, action: encryption required).
*   **Observational Data Collector:** Continuously monitors the provider network, collecting data on resource configurations, access patterns, network traffic, and application behavior.  Stores this in a time-series database.
*   **Anomaly Detection Module:**  Identifies deviations from established baselines and potential violations of implicit governance expectations.  This module learns from the observational data.
*   **Rule Synthesis Engine:** Combines the output from the NLP engine and the anomaly detection module to refine and synthesize formal governance requirement rules.
*   **Rule Validation Engine:** Tests synthesized rules against historical and current observational data to assess their accuracy and minimize false positives.  This is crucial for preventing disruptive enforcement.
*   **Policy Integration Module:**  Maps synthesized rules to existing security policies, compliance frameworks (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA), and business requirements.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Input:** A user provides a natural language description of a governance requirement.
2.  **NLP Processing:** The NLP engine extracts key entities and intents, creating a draft rule.
3.  **Data Collection & Analysis:** The Observational Data Collector gathers relevant data, and the Anomaly Detection Module identifies potential violations of the *implied* intent within the natural language description.
4.  **Rule Refinement:** The Rule Synthesis Engine combines the draft rule with the anomaly detection findings.  For example, if the NLP specifies “encrypt all database instances”, but the anomaly detection module reveals specific instances are *already* encrypted with a different method, the rule can be refined to accommodate this.
5.  **Validation:** The Rule Validation Engine tests the refined rule against historical data to assess its accuracy and prevent unintended consequences.
6.  **Policy Mapping:** The synthesized rule is mapped to relevant policies and compliance frameworks.
7.  **Deployment:** The validated rule is integrated into the Intent-Based Governance Service for automated enforcement.

**3. Pseudocode (Rule Synthesis Engine):**

```
function synthesize_rule(nlp_output, anomaly_data):
  // nlp_output: dictionary containing entities, intents, conditions
  // anomaly_data: list of detected anomalies related to the intent

  refined_rule = nlp_output

  for anomaly in anomaly_data:
    if anomaly.type == "existing_configuration":
      // Adjust rule to accommodate existing configurations
      if anomaly.condition == "encrypted":
        refined_rule.condition["encryption_method"] = anomaly.method
    elif anomaly.type == "access_pattern":
      // Add conditions based on access patterns
      refined_rule.condition["access_control"] = anomaly.access_control_type
    elif anomaly.type == "network_traffic":
      // Add conditions based on network traffic patterns
      refined_rule.condition["network_segment"] = anomaly.network_segment

  return refined_rule
```

**4. Data Structures:**

*   **Anomaly:**  {type: string, condition: string, method: string, access\_control\_type: string, network\_segment: string}
*   **GovernanceRule:** {condition: dictionary, action: string, scope: list, policy\_mapping: list}

**5. Enhancements:**

*   **Feedback Loop:**  Allow users to review and refine synthesized rules before deployment, providing a human-in-the-loop mechanism.
*   **AI-Powered Rule Recommendation:**  Proactively suggest governance rules based on observed network behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
*   **Context-Aware Governance:**  Dynamically adjust governance rules based on the sensitivity of the data being processed and the context of the application.
