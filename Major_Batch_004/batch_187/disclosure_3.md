## Dynamic Trajectory Envelope Morphing via Swarm Sonar

**Concept:** Expand beyond single UAV detection and prediction by employing a temporary, localized swarm of micro-drones to dynamically refine trajectory envelopes of detected objects, particularly for objects exhibiting erratic or unpredictable behavior. This dramatically improves accuracy in complex environments and handles situations where initial performance parameter estimates are insufficient.

**Specifications:**

*   **Micro-Drone Swarm:** 5-15 micro-drones (approx. 100g each) deployed from the primary UAV upon object detection. Each drone is equipped with:
    *   High-frequency sonar (capable of short-range, high-resolution mapping)
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
    *   Short-range radio communication
    *   Basic collision avoidance system
*   **Deployment Protocol:** Upon object detection and categorization, the primary UAV initiates swarm deployment. Drones autonomously form a loose, adaptive formation around the target object, maintaining a safe distance. Formation is maintained via inter-drone communication and relative positioning data.
*   **Sonar Mapping & Data Fusion:** Each micro-drone actively emits sonar pulses and records reflected signals. Raw sonar data is processed onboard each drone to generate localized point clouds representing the object’s surface and immediate surroundings. This data is then transmitted to the primary UAV.
*   **Trajectory Envelope Refinement:** The primary UAV’s flight management component receives and fuses data from all micro-drones. This creates a dynamically updating, high-resolution 3D map of the object. The map is then used to refine the initial trajectory envelope in the following ways:
    *   **Shape Adjustment:** The trajectory envelope is no longer limited to simplified geometric shapes (e.g., spheres, cylinders). It conforms to the actual shape of the object, as determined by the sonar map.
    *   **Behavioral Prediction:** Changes in the object’s shape or movement (e.g., rotation, acceleration) are immediately reflected in the trajectory envelope. Allows for prediction of complex maneuvers that would be missed by traditional performance parameter estimation.
    *   **Probabilistic Weighting:** The trajectory envelope is overlaid with probabilistic weights, indicating the likelihood of the object occupying specific locations within the envelope. These weights are dynamically adjusted based on the real-time sonar data.
*   **Swarm Retraction & Power Management:** The micro-drone swarm is automatically retracted once the object is no longer considered a threat or when the UAV enters a safe zone. Micro-drones return to the primary UAV for recharging and data offloading. Power management prioritizes sustained operation within the effective sonar range.
*   **Data Processing Pipeline (Pseudocode):**

    ```
    // On Primary UAV
    function ProcessSwarmData(swarmData):
        // Fuse point clouds from all drones
        unifiedPointCloud = FusePointCloud(swarmData.pointClouds)
        // Extract object shape and movement
        objectShape = ExtractShape(unifiedPointCloud)
        objectMovement = AnalyzeMovement(unifiedPointCloud)
        // Update Trajectory Envelope
        refinedEnvelope = GenerateRefinedEnvelope(objectShape, objectMovement, initialEnvelope)
        return refinedEnvelope
    ```

    ```
    // On Micro-Drone
    function CollectSonarData():
        emitSonarPulse()
        receiveReflectedSignal()
        generatePointCloud()
        transmitPointCloud()
    ```

*   **Scalability:** The number of micro-drones deployed can be adjusted based on the size and complexity of the target object and the environmental conditions.
*   **Safety Mechanisms:** Redundant communication channels, emergency landing protocols, and geofencing prevent uncontrolled operation and potential collisions.
