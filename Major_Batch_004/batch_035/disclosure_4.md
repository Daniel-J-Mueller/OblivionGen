## Dynamic Security Group Inheritance & Temporal Policies

**Concept:** Extend the control/native security group architecture to incorporate hierarchical inheritance and time-based policies. Instead of solely associating control groups with native groups, allow control groups to *inherit* permissions from other control groups, creating a security lineage. Further, introduce policies that automatically adjust permissions based on time, user behavior, or data sensitivity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Security Group Hierarchy:**

*   **Data Structure:** Implement a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to represent the security group hierarchy. Each node represents a control group. Edges represent inheritance relationships ("inherits from").
*   **Permission Resolution:** When determining effective permissions for a user accessing a data instance, traverse the DAG *upwards* from the user’s primary control group. Aggregate permissions from all inherited groups. Conflicts are resolved by precedence (explicitly defined settings or last-defined setting).
*   **API Extension:** Add API endpoints to:
    *   Create/Delete/Modify inheritance relationships between control groups.
    *   Query the inheritance graph for a given control group.
    *   Simulate effective permissions for a user given a control group and a data instance.

**2. Temporal Policies:**

*   **Policy Definition:** Introduce a "Policy Engine" that allows definition of policies based on:
    *   **Time:** (e.g., "Grant read access to group X from 9 AM to 5 PM.")
    *   **User Behavior:** (e.g., "If user Y attempts more than 5 failed login attempts within 1 hour, revoke all access.")
    *   **Data Sensitivity:** (e.g., "If data tag Z is set to 'Confidential', restrict access to control group A.")
*   **Policy Execution:** Integrate the Policy Engine with the permission resolution process. Policies are evaluated *before* effective permissions are determined.
*   **Event Triggering:** Use a message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to receive events related to user activity, data changes, and time.
*   **Policy Format (JSON Example):**

```json
{
  "policy_id": "temp_access_1",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "time",
    "schedule": "0 9-17 * * *"  // Cron expression for 9 AM to 5 PM
  },
  "condition": null,
  "action": {
    "type": "permission_change",
    "control_group": "developers",
    "permission": "read",
    "resource": "sensitive_data"
  }
}
```

**3. Infrastructure Components:**

*   **Policy Engine Service:** A microservice responsible for policy definition, storage, and execution.
*   **Event Ingestion Service:** Receives events from various sources and forwards them to the Policy Engine.
*   **Permission Resolution Service:** Modifies the existing service to integrate with the Policy Engine and evaluate temporal policies.
*   **Data Store:** Graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to store the security group hierarchy. Relational database for policy definitions and events.

**Pseudocode (Permission Resolution):**

```
function resolvePermissions(user, controlGroup, dataInstance):
  // 1. Retrieve inherited control groups from the graph database
  inheritedGroups = getInheritedGroups(controlGroup)

  // 2. Combine all control groups (user's group + inherited groups)
  allGroups = [controlGroup] + inheritedGroups

  // 3. Evaluate temporal policies for each group
  for group in allGroups:
    policies = getPoliciesForGroup(group)
    for policy in policies:
      if policy.trigger.type == "time":
        if isPolicyActive(policy): // Check if the time-based condition is met
          applyPolicy(policy) // Modify permissions based on the policy
      // Add other trigger types (user behavior, data sensitivity) here

  // 4. Aggregate permissions from all groups
  effectivePermissions = aggregatePermissions(allGroups)

  return effectivePermissions
```

This system allows for a much more flexible and dynamic approach to security management, allowing for fine-grained control and automated adaptation to changing conditions. It offers a way to build “living” security policies.
