## Dynamic Social Influence Mapping & Predictive Item Exposure

**Concept:** Leverage social network data not just to *personalize* display, but to predict the *propagation* of interest within a user’s network and proactively tailor item exposure *before* a user explicitly expresses preference. This moves beyond reactive personalization to anticipatory influence.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:** Expand data sources beyond immediate social connections. Incorporate data from second and third-degree connections (friends of friends, friends of friends of friends) with associated interaction metrics (likes, comments, shares) on items similar to those in the catalog.  Data will be pulled from linked social accounts, and also inferred from public activity.
*   **Influence Score:** Develop an 'Influence Score' for each user, factoring in:
    *   Network size and diversity
    *   Engagement rate with posted content
    *   Network engagement with items similar to catalog offerings
    *   Credibility metrics (verified accounts, etc.)
*   **Propagation Model:** Implement a propagation model (agent-based simulation or similar) that predicts how interest in an item will spread through a user’s network. Parameters include:
    *   Initial 'seed' user (the individual browsing the catalog)
    *   Influence Scores of connected users
    *   Item characteristics (category, price, appeal to different demographics)
    *   'Virality' potential (based on historical data)
*   **Dynamic Item Prioritization:** Instead of simply personalizing the *display* of items, prioritize items based on the predicted network propagation score.  Items with a high potential to generate “buzz” within the user's network are surfaced more prominently.  This will require a multi-stage ranking system:
    1.  Standard personalization score (based on user preferences).
    2.  Propagation score (predicted network reach).
    3.  Combined score (weighted average of personalization and propagation).
*   **Pre-emptive Content Generation:** Generate short-form content (images, videos, text snippets) *specifically tailored* for sharing on different social platforms.  This content is automatically presented to the user as a pre-populated “share” option. Content will dynamically adjust to the platform in question.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateNetworkPropagationScore(user, item):
    //Get user's social network data
    network = GetUserNetwork(user)

    //Calculate influence scores for each connection
    FOR connection IN network:
        connection.InfluenceScore = CalculateInfluenceScore(connection)

    //Initialize propagation score
    propagationScore = 0

    //Agent-based simulation (simplified)
    FOR i IN range(simulationSteps):
        FOR connection IN network:
            IF connection.InfluenceScore > threshold AND item matches connection’s interests:
                propagationScore += connection.InfluenceScore * probabilityOfSharing

    RETURN propagationScore

FUNCTION PrioritizeItems(user, itemList):
    FOR item IN itemList:
        item.PersonalizationScore = CalculatePersonalizationScore(user, item)
        item.PropagationScore = CalculateNetworkPropagationScore(user, item)
        item.CombinedScore = (weightPersonalization * item.PersonalizationScore) + (weightPropagation * item.PropagationScore)

    //Sort items by CombinedScore (descending)
    sortedItems = Sort(items, CombinedScore)

    RETURN sortedItems
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   High-performance computing infrastructure to support propagation simulations.
*   Real-time data ingestion pipelines to process social network data.
*   Machine learning models for calculating influence scores and predicting item appeal.
*   Scalable content generation engine for creating shareable content.
