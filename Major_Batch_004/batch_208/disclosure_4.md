**Dynamic Occlusion Mapping for Predictive Rendering**

**Concept:** Expand the motion extraction to *predict* occlusion based on extrapolated movement, filling extracted regions *before* the next frame is captured. This creates smoother, more realistic results, especially in high-motion scenarios.

**Specs:**

1.  **Motion Vector Field Generation:**
    *   Input: Sequential image data (as per the patent).
    *   Process: Enhance motion detection to not just identify *what* moved, but *how* it moved â€“ generating a dense motion vector field across the image. Utilize optical flow algorithms (e.g., Farneback, Lucas-Kanade) combined with learned motion patterns to improve accuracy.
    *   Output: A vector field assigning a direction and magnitude of movement to each pixel.

2.  **Trajectory Prediction:**
    *   Input: Motion vector field, historical motion data (last N frames).
    *   Process: Implement a trajectory prediction module.  Could be a simple linear extrapolation, or a more sophisticated model (e.g., Kalman filter, LSTM network).  Predict the position of moving objects for the *next* frame, even *before* that frame is captured.
    *   Output: Predicted positions of moving objects for the next frame.

3.  **Occlusion Map Generation:**
    *   Input: Predicted object positions, current frame image.
    *   Process: Generate an occlusion map based on predicted object positions. This map indicates which areas of the current frame will be occluded by moving objects in the next frame.
    *   Output: Occlusion map (binary or grayscale indicating degree of occlusion).

4.  **Pre-emptive Fill:**
    *   Input: Current frame, occlusion map, baseline image (static background).
    *   Process: *Before* capturing the next frame, use the occlusion map to fill the areas where moving objects *will* be. This involves blending or replacing the affected pixels with content from the baseline image. This is the core innovation.
    *   Output: Pre-filled frame.

5.  **Refinement & Blending:**
    *   Input: Captured next frame, pre-filled frame.
    *   Process: Compare the captured frame with the pre-filled frame.  Adjust the pre-filled regions based on the actual captured data. Use advanced blending techniques (e.g., Poisson blending, gradient domain manipulation) to seamlessly integrate the pre-filled regions with the actual captured data.
    *   Output: Final motion-extracted image with improved smoothness and realism.

**Pseudocode (Core Pre-emptive Fill step):**

```
function preFill(currentFrame, occlusionMap, baselineImage):
  preFilledFrame = copy(currentFrame)
  for each pixel (x, y) in currentFrame:
    if occlusionMap[x, y] > threshold:  //Pixel will be occluded
      preFilledFrame[x, y] = baselineImage[x, y] //Replace with baseline
  return preFilledFrame
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Dedicated processing unit (GPU or FPGA) for real-time motion vector field generation and occlusion map rendering.
*   High-speed image sensor with low latency to minimize the delay between frame capture and processing.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Real-time video editing and effects.
*   Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).
*   Robotics and autonomous navigation.
*   Augmented and virtual reality.
