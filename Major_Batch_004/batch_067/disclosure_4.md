## Dynamic Emotional CAPTCHA - v1.0

**Concept:** Leverage real-time facial expression analysis & generative AI to create CAPTCHAs tailored to evoke specific emotional responses in users, assessing not *what* they select, but *how* they react.

**Rationale:** Existing CAPTCHAs are beatable through AI. This system moves beyond simple object recognition towards a deeper understanding of human emotional processing, leveraging the difficulty AI has in authentically *experiencing* emotion.

**System Components:**

1.  **Facial Expression Analysis Module:**
    *   Utilizes a high-resolution webcam feed.
    *   Employs a trained deep learning model (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) to detect and classify core facial expressions (anger, joy, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust, neutral).
    *   Provides a real-time “emotional signature” based on the probabilities of each detected expression.
2.  **Generative CAPTCHA Engine:**
    *   Uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) or diffusion model to create CAPTCHA images/scenarios.
    *   GAN/Diffusion model trained on a dataset of images/scenarios designed to subtly elicit specific emotional responses. (e.g., slightly unsettling landscapes for anxiety, cute animal pictures for joy, ambiguous social situations for confusion).
    *   Parameters controlling the “emotional intensity” of the generated content.
3.  **Response Evaluation Module:**
    *   Monitors the user's facial expressions *during* the CAPTCHA interaction (not just at the selection moment).
    *   Compares the observed emotional signature to an expected signature based on the generated CAPTCHA content.
    *   Calculates a "emotional congruence score" representing the similarity between the observed and expected emotional responses.
    *   A threshold congruence score determines whether the user is classified as human.

**Workflow:**

1.  User requests access to a webpage.
2.  System activates the webcam and initiates facial expression analysis.
3.  Generative CAPTCHA Engine creates a visually stimulating scene with a subtly designed emotional trigger.
4.  The scene is presented to the user, requesting them to perform a simple task (e.g., "Identify the object in the image," "Select the matching pair").
5.  The Response Evaluation Module monitors the user’s facial expressions *while* they interact with the CAPTCHA.
6.  A congruence score is calculated.
7.  If the score exceeds the threshold, the user is granted access. Otherwise, the CAPTCHA is repeated with a different stimulus.

**Pseudocode (Response Evaluation Module):**

```
function evaluate_response(observed_emotions, expected_emotions):
  # observed_emotions: Dictionary of emotion probabilities (e.g., {"joy": 0.1, "sadness": 0.7})
  # expected_emotions: Dictionary of expected emotion probabilities.
  
  similarity_score = 0
  
  for emotion in observed_emotions:
    if emotion in expected_emotions:
      similarity_score += abs(observed_emotions[emotion] - expected_emotions[emotion])
  
  # Normalize the score (higher = more congruent)
  congruence_score = 1 - (similarity_score / len(observed_emotions))
  
  return congruence_score
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Webcam Resolution:** Minimum 720p.
*   **Frame Rate:** 30 FPS.
*   **Emotional Categories:** Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, Neutral.
*   **Threshold Congruence Score:** Adjustable (default: 0.7).
*   **Data Storage:** Logs of user interactions (facial expression data, congruence scores) for analysis and model improvement.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** Implement robust privacy safeguards to protect user data. Option for users to opt-out of facial expression analysis (with alternative CAPTCHA mechanism).
