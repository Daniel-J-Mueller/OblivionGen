## Distributed Reputation Network with Predictive Scoring

**System Specifications:**

**Core Concept:** Expand the existing threat data aggregation to create a distributed, reputation-based scoring system that *predicts* potential threats based on behavioral analysis *before* malicious activity is confirmed. This shifts focus from reactive detection to proactive prevention.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Sensor Suite:**  Extend the existing threat sensors to capture a broader range of behavioral data. This includes:
    *   Network traffic patterns (packet size, frequency, protocols).
    *   System resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
    *   Process execution behavior (command-line arguments, DLL loading).
    *   User activity logs (login times, accessed files, executed applications).
2.  **Distributed Behavioral Database (DBBD):** A highly scalable, distributed database to store the collected behavioral data.  Data should be partitioned by source IP address/entity ID to facilitate rapid querying.  Utilize a NoSQL database (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) for schema flexibility and horizontal scalability.
3.  **Behavioral Analysis Engine (BAE):**  A core component responsible for analyzing the behavioral data and generating behavioral profiles for each source. This will employ machine learning algorithms, specifically:
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify deviations from established behavioral baselines. Algorithms: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM.
    *   **Behavioral Clustering:** Group sources with similar behavioral patterns. Algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN.
    *   **Predictive Modeling:**  Train models to predict the likelihood of malicious activity based on historical behavioral data. Algorithms: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
4.  **Reputation Scoring System:**  Assign a reputation score to each source based on its behavioral profile and the output of the BAE. This score should incorporate:
    *   **Severity of Anomalies:** Higher severity anomalies contribute to a lower score.
    *   **Frequency of Anomalies:**  More frequent anomalies contribute to a lower score.
    *   **Similarity to Known Malicious Profiles:**  Similarity to known malicious profiles (derived from threat intelligence feeds) contributes to a lower score.
    *   **Time Decay:**  Reputation scores should decay over time to account for changes in behavior.
5.  **Distributed Risk Assessment Service:** A service that integrates the reputation scores with real-time network traffic data to assess the risk associated with each connection attempt. This service can trigger automated actions, such as:
    *   Blocking connections from low-reputation sources.
    *   Redirecting traffic to a sandbox for further analysis.
    *   Increasing logging and monitoring for suspicious activity.

**Pseudocode (Risk Assessment Service):**

```
function assess_risk(source_ip, destination_ip, protocol, port) {
  reputation_score = get_reputation_score(source_ip);
  risk_level = 0;

  if (reputation_score < threshold_low) {
    risk_level = 3; // High Risk - Block Connection
  } else if (reputation_score < threshold_medium) {
    risk_level = 2; // Medium Risk - Redirect to Sandbox
  } else if (reputation_score < threshold_high) {
    risk_level = 1; // Low Risk - Increase Logging
  } else {
    risk_level = 0; // No Risk - Allow Connection
  }

  // Apply Protocol/Port Specific Risk Adjustments
  if (protocol == "TCP" && port == 80) {
    risk_level = min(risk_level + 1, 3); // Increase risk for web traffic
  }

  // Take Action Based on Risk Level
  if (risk_level == 3) {
    block_connection(source_ip);
  } else if (risk_level == 2) {
    redirect_to_sandbox(source_ip, destination_ip);
  } else if (risk_level == 1) {
    increase_logging(source_ip);
  }

  return risk_level;
}
```

**Scalability & Distribution:**

*   Utilize a distributed message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to ingest sensor data.
*   Partition the DBBD based on source IP address to distribute the load.
*   Deploy the BAE and Risk Assessment Service as microservices for independent scaling.

**Novelty:**

This system shifts the focus from *detecting* threats to *predicting* them. By analyzing behavioral patterns and assigning predictive scores, the system can proactively prevent malicious activity before it occurs, rather than simply responding to it after it has been detected. The distributed nature of the system ensures scalability and resilience, while the microservices architecture allows for independent development and deployment.
