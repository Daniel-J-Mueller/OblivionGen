## Adaptive Streaming & Haptic Feedback Integration

**Concept:** Extend the camera-based analysis to incorporate haptic feedback on a display device (or connected peripheral) to dynamically adjust streaming content *and* provide tactile reinforcement of on-screen events, creating a more immersive experience. This goes beyond visual adjustment to engage another sensory modality.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing Streaming Source
    *   Display Device with integrated haptic layer (or connection point for a haptic peripheral – glove, vest, etc.) – capable of localized vibration/pressure.
    *   Camera – positioned to capture both the display *and* user interaction (hands, face).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Visual Analysis Module:* (Existing – from patent) – analyzes displayed content & user interaction.
    *   *Haptic Mapping Module:* Defines mappings between visual events and corresponding haptic patterns (intensity, frequency, location). This module is extensible with user defined rules and presets.
    *   *Haptic Control Module:* Drives the haptic device based on the output of the Haptic Mapping Module.
    *   *Sensor Fusion Module:* Combines data from camera (visual & gesture recognition) with data from the display (current content) to inform haptic output.
*   **Operational Flow:**
    1.  Streaming Source sends content to Display Device.
    2.  Camera captures Display and User Interaction.
    3.  Sensor Fusion Module processes camera input and display content.
    4.  Visual Analysis Module determines image quality, user experience, or testing outcomes (as per original patent).
    5.  *Haptic Mapping Module* determines appropriate haptic pattern based on visual events (e.g., impact in a game, texture change in a video, UI element selection).
    6.  Haptic Control Module sends signal to haptic device.
    7.  Streaming Source adjusts content *and* Haptic Mapping Module dynamically adjusts haptic output in response to analysis.
*   **Pseudocode (Haptic Mapping Module):**

```pseudocode
function determine_haptic_pattern(event_type, event_intensity, user_profile):
    if event_type == "impact":
        haptic_intensity = event_intensity * user_profile.impact_sensitivity
        haptic_location = impact_location_on_screen
        haptic_pattern = "pulse"
    else if event_type == "texture_change":
        haptic_intensity = texture_roughness * user_profile.texture_sensitivity
        haptic_location = texture_location_on_screen
        haptic_pattern = "vibration"
    else if event_type == "ui_selection":
        haptic_intensity = 0.5  // fixed intensity
        haptic_location = ui_element_location
        haptic_pattern = "click"
    else:
        haptic_intensity = 0
        haptic_pattern = "none"

    return haptic_intensity, haptic_pattern, haptic_location
```

*   **Testing Integration:** The testing system (from the patent) can be expanded to include haptic feedback validation. Test outcomes can now assess the accuracy and appropriateness of haptic feedback in response to specific events. Metrics could include synchronization between visual and haptic events, perceived intensity, and user feedback on immersion.
*   **User Profile:** Each user can have a profile stored, defining sensitivity settings for different haptic patterns, allowing for a personalized experience.
