## Network Extender - Bio-Integrated Signal Booster

**Concept:** Integrate the network extender functionality with a bio-luminescent fungal network for localized signal amplification and adaptive range extension. Inspired by the existing device's signal boosting function, this aims for a living, self-repairing, and aesthetically integrated solution, particularly suited for rural/off-grid environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Genetically modified *Mycena lux-coeli* fungal network. This species naturally exhibits bio-luminescence. Genetic modification focuses on enhancing luminescence triggered *specifically* by WiFi/radio frequency signals.  The fungal network forms the "body" of the extender.
*   **Housing:**  A semi-permeable, biodegradable bioplastic shell (PHA - Polyhydroxyalkanoates) shaped like a stylized, large-leaf structure.  The shell provides physical protection and contains nutrient supply for the fungus. Size approximately 30cm x 20cm x 5cm.
*   **Signal Reception/Transmission:**  Miniaturized, low-power WiFi/radio frequency transceiver module embedded within the bioplastic housing, directly interfacing with the fungal network. This module captures/broadcasts the signal, acting as the 'seed' for the bio-amplification.  Module size: 5cm x 5cm x 1cm.
*   **Bio-Amplification Mechanism:**  When the transceiver receives a weak signal, it stimulates specific proteins within the fungal network. This stimulation causes localized, amplified bio-luminescence *at the point of signal weakness*. The luminescence acts as a focused repeater, strengthening the signal.  The degree of luminescence directly corresponds to signal strength.
*   **Power Source:**  Hybrid system:
    *   **Primary:**  Small, integrated solar panel on the upper surface of the leaf structure.
    *   **Secondary:**  Biochemical energy harvesting from fungal metabolism (limited capacity, but extends operational time during low light).
*   **Nutrient Supply:**  Automated nutrient delivery system integrated into the bioplastic housing. A reservoir holds a liquid nutrient solution, delivered via micro-capillary action to the fungal network. Replenishment cycle: Monthly.
*   **Adaptive Range Extension:** The fungal network grows and expands outward (within defined parameters via the bioplastic structure) to extend the range of the extender.  Growth rate is adaptive based on signal strength and environmental conditions.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Extender communicates via standard WiFi/radio frequency protocols. Diagnostic data (signal strength, nutrient levels, fungal health) is transmitted to a central network management system.

**Pseudocode (Fungal Network Bio-Amplification):**

```
// Variables:
signalStrength (float): Incoming signal strength (dBm)
luminescenceLevel (int): Output luminescence intensity (0-100)
nutrientLevel (float): Available nutrient level (0.0 - 1.0)
fungalHealth (float): Overall fungal health (0.0 - 1.0)

// Function: calculateLuminescence
function calculateLuminescence(signalStrength, nutrientLevel, fungalHealth) {
  // Input Validation
  if (signalStrength < -70) { //Very weak signal
    signalStrength = -70;
  }
  if (nutrientLevel < 0.1) { //Low Nutrient
    luminescenceLevel = 0; //No Luminescence
    return luminescenceLevel;
  }
  if (fungalHealth < 0.1) { //Unhealthy Fungus
    luminescenceLevel = 0; //No Luminescence
    return luminescenceLevel;
  }

  // Scale Signal Strength
  scaledSignal = map(signalStrength, -70, -20, 0, 100); // Map -70 to -20 dBm to 0-100

  //Apply Nutrient and Health Modifiers
  luminescenceLevel = scaledSignal * nutrientLevel * fungalHealth;

  //Cap Luminescence Level
  if (luminescenceLevel > 100) {
    luminescenceLevel = 100;
  }

  return luminescenceLevel;
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  signalStrength = getSignalStrength();
  nutrientLevel = getNutrientLevel();
  fungalHealth = getFungalHealth();

  luminescenceLevel = calculateLuminescence(signalStrength, nutrientLevel, fungalHealth);

  setLuminescence(luminescenceLevel);

  delay(100); // Update every 100ms
}
