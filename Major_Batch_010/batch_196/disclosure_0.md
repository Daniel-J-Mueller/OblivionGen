## Hardware Card Predictive Failure & Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Expand the thermal adaptation idea to proactively predict component failure *before* thermal thresholds are reached, and dynamically allocate system resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) *away* from the failing hardware card to maintain overall system stability. This goes beyond simple fan control; it’s about intelligent, pre-emptive system-level mitigation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Card Instrumentation:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Each hardware card incorporates:
    *   Temperature sensors (as per the original patent).
    *   Voltage/Current monitoring for *all* major ICs.
    *   Micro-vibration sensors (MEMS accelerometers) to detect early signs of mechanical stress/failure in components like fans or connectors.
    *   Digital Signal Processing (DSP) core on the card for localized sensor data pre-processing and feature extraction.  This minimizes bandwidth usage to the host.
*   **Local Storage:**  Small, non-volatile memory (e.g., FRAM or eMMC) on the card to store:
    *   Baseline operating parameters (voltage, current, vibration, temperature) established during initial system burn-in.
    *   Historical sensor data logs (rolling window of, say, 24 hours).
    *   Pre-trained machine learning model for anomaly detection (see Software section).

**2. Host System Integration:**

*   **Dedicated PCIe Interface:** Each hardware card connects via PCIe with a dedicated Direct Memory Access (DMA) channel for sensor data transfer.
*   **Resource Management Controller (RMC):** A dedicated co-processor on the motherboard responsible for:
    *   Receiving and analyzing sensor data from all hardware cards.
    *   Running the global resource allocation algorithm.
    *   Communicating with the OS kernel to re-allocate resources.
*   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):**  High-speed IPC mechanism (e.g., shared memory, RDMA) between the RMC and the OS kernel.

**3. Software Architecture:**

*   **On-Card Anomaly Detection:** The DSP on each card runs a lightweight anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., autoencoder, one-class SVM) trained on the card’s baseline data. This algorithm generates a "health score" representing the card’s current condition.
*   **Global Resource Allocation Algorithm (RMC):**
    *   Input: Health scores from all hardware cards, current system load (CPU, memory, network), application priorities.
    *   Logic:
        1.  Identify cards with health scores below a configurable threshold (indicating potential failure).
        2.  If a card is flagged, calculate the potential impact of its failure on running applications.
        3.  Proactively migrate workloads *away* from the failing card to healthy cards or the host CPU.  Prioritize critical applications.
        4.  Reduce the card’s resource allocation (CPU affinity, memory limits, network bandwidth).
        5.  Log the event and trigger alerts.
*   **Predictive Modeling (Host):**  A central host server collects historical sensor data from all cards to train a more sophisticated predictive model (e.g., LSTM neural network).  This model can identify subtle patterns that indicate impending failure *before* the on-card anomaly detection triggers.  The model parameters are periodically pushed to the on-card DSPs to improve their accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Global Resource Allocation Algorithm – RMC):**

```
function allocateResources(cardHealthScores, systemLoad, appPriorities):
  for each card in hardwareCards:
    if card.healthScore < failureThreshold:
      impact = calculateFailureImpact(card, appPriorities)
      if impact > criticalThreshold:
        //Migrate workloads
        migrateWorkloads(card, healthyCards)
        //Reduce resource allocation
        reduceResourceAllocation(card)
        logEvent("Proactive mitigation of card failure: " + card.ID)
    end if
  end for
end function

function migrateWorkloads(failingCard, healthyCards):
  //Identify workloads running on failingCard
  workloads = getWorkloads(failingCard)
  //Select target healthyCard based on capacity and proximity
  targetCard = selectTargetCard(healthyCards, workloads)
  //Migrate workloads to targetCard
  moveWorkloads(workloads, targetCard)
end function
```

**Novelty:**  This isn't just about reacting to temperature; it's about predicting failure *before* it happens and intelligently re-allocating resources to maintain system stability.  The combination of on-card anomaly detection, host-based predictive modeling, and dynamic resource allocation is a significant advancement.  The use of multiple sensor types (vibration, voltage/current) provides a more comprehensive view of hardware health.
