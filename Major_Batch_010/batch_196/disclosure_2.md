## Adaptive Content Projection with Environmental Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the state transfer concept to dynamically project content onto real-world surfaces, adjusting the displayed state based on environmental understanding and user interaction. Imagine transferring a game state from a phone to being displayed *on* a wall, or projecting a collaborative workspace onto a table.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Source Device:** Smartphone, tablet, or computer capable of running the state transfer application (as described in the provided patent). Equipped with:
    *   High-resolution camera for environment scanning.
    *   Bluetooth/Wi-Fi/Ultra-Wideband (UWB) for communication.
*   **Projection Unit:** A compact, portable projector with:
    *   Wide-angle lens.
    *   Auto-keystone correction.
    *   High brightness and contrast for various lighting conditions.
    *   UWB/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - accelerometer, gyroscope.
*   **Optional Depth Sensor:** Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor integrated into the projection unit or as a separate accessory for improved environmental understanding and occlusion handling.

**II. Software Architecture:**

*   **Environmental Mapping Module:**
    *   Utilizes the source device's camera and, optionally, the depth sensor to create a 3D mesh of the surrounding environment.
    *   Employs SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms for accurate mapping and tracking of the projection surface.
    *   Identifies surfaces suitable for projection (walls, tables, floors, etc.).
    *   Handles dynamic environments – detecting and mapping moving objects.
*   **State Transfer Module:** (Leverages existing patent technology)
    *   Receives state information from the source device.
    *   Communicates with the projection unit.
*   **Content Adaptation Module:**
    *   Receives content and state information.
    *   Adapts the content to the mapped projection surface.
    *   Adjusts content size, perspective, and brightness based on surface geometry and ambient lighting.
    *   Implements occlusion handling – rendering content around or behind real-world objects.
*   **Interaction Module:**
    *   Detects user interactions with the projected content (touch, gestures, voice).
    *   Translates interactions into commands for the source device and/or projected application.
    *   Supports multi-user interaction.

**III. Pseudocode (State Transfer & Projection):**

```
// Source Device
scanEnvironment() -> 3D environment map
captureAppState() -> app state data
sendAppState(app state data, environment map) -> Projection Unit

// Projection Unit
receiveData(app state data, environment map)
mapContentToEnvironment(app state data, environment map)
projectContent()
detectUserInteraction()
sendInteractionData(interaction data) -> Source Device
```

**IV. Operational Modes:**

*   **Game Projection:** Transfer game state from a mobile device to project onto a wall or table, creating an immersive gaming experience.
*   **Collaborative Workspace:** Project a shared document or application onto a table, allowing multiple users to interact with it simultaneously.
*   **Interactive Art Installation:** Project dynamic visuals onto a wall or surface, responding to user movements or environmental changes.
*   **Augmented Reality Overlay:** Overlay virtual information onto real-world objects, enhancing their functionality or providing additional context.



**V. Future Considerations:**

*   Integration with AR/VR headsets for enhanced immersion.
*   AI-powered content adaptation for optimal visual quality.
*   Gesture recognition for more intuitive interaction.
*   Support for multiple projection units for larger displays.
