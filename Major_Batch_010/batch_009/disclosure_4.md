## Dynamic Network Topology-Aware Authentication via Ephemeral Mesh Networks

**Concept:** Extend proximity-based authentication by creating temporary, localized mesh networks overlaid on existing infrastructure. These mesh networks aren't pre-configured; they *emerge* based on client request and dynamically adjust to network conditions. This offers a more granular and adaptable proximity verification than static TTL/hop count methods, and allows authentication *within* a defined physical space, not just 'close to' a service.

**Specifications:**

**1. Mesh Network Controller (MNC):**

*   **Function:** Orchestrates the ephemeral mesh network. Hosted on the service provider's infrastructure.
*   **API:**
    *   `createMesh(clientDeviceID, serviceID, desiredMeshSize)`: Initiates mesh creation centered around the client. `desiredMeshSize` dictates how many 'nodes' should attempt to join the mesh.
    *   `reportNodeStatus(nodeID, signalStrength, latency)`:  Receives status updates from mesh nodes.
    *   `authenticateRequest(clientDeviceID, meshData)`:  Receives mesh data from the client and performs authentication.
*   **Internal Logic:**
    *   Maintains a database of active meshes and associated clients/services.
    *   Implements mesh creation algorithms (e.g., flooding, randomized selection).
    *   Monitors mesh health and adjusts node selection.

**2. Mesh Node Agent (MNA):**

*   **Deployment:** Software agent deployed on client devices and potentially on strategically placed 'anchor' devices (e.g., access points, IoT devices).
*   **Function:** Participates in the mesh network, reports status to the MNC, and facilitates data exchange.
*   **Communication:** Utilizes a lightweight, peer-to-peer protocol (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy, Zigbee, Wi-Fi Direct) for mesh communication.
*   **Logic:**
    *   Scans for nearby mesh nodes.
    *   Establishes and maintains connections with mesh nodes.
    *   Periodically reports signal strength, latency, and estimated distance to the MNC.
    *   Relays messages between mesh nodes (if acting as a router).

**3. Authentication Flow:**

1.  **Client Request:** A client device requests access to a service.
2.  **Mesh Initiation:** The service provider’s infrastructure contacts the MNC with the client’s ID and service ID. The MNC initiates mesh creation, broadcasting a signal to nearby devices.
3.  **Node Discovery:** MNAs on client devices and anchor devices discover the mesh creation signal and join the mesh (if within range/policy).
4.  **Mesh Data Collection:** The MNC collects data from the MNAs, including signal strength, latency, and estimated distance between the client and other mesh nodes.
5.  **Proximity Verification:** The MNC utilizes this data to calculate a “proximity score” for the client, based on factors like the density of mesh nodes, signal strength, and latency. A proximity policy defines acceptable scores.
6.  **Authentication Decision:** The MNC grants or denies access based on the proximity score and the service's authentication policy.
7.  **Mesh Dissolution:** The mesh is temporarily maintained for a set duration or until the client disconnects. Alternatively, the mesh can dissolve immediately after authentication.

**Pseudocode (MNC - authenticateRequest):**

```
function authenticateRequest(clientDeviceID, meshData):
  proximityScore = calculateProximityScore(meshData)
  policy = getAuthenticationPolicy(clientDeviceID)
  if proximityScore >= policy.minimumProximityScore and
     policy.allowedNetworks contains meshData.networkID:
    grantAccess(clientDeviceID)
    return true
  else:
    denyAccess(clientDeviceID)
    return false
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Dynamic Topology:**  The mesh isn't static; it adapts to the physical environment and device movement.
*   **Multi-Factor Proximity:** Combines signal strength, latency, and network density for a more accurate proximity assessment.
*   **Policy-Driven Authentication:**  Authentication rules can be tailored to specific services and locations.
*   **Ephemeral Networks:** Reduces the attack surface by creating temporary, on-demand networks.
