## Dynamic Zoning & Personalized Micro-Advertising

**Concept:** Extend the sensor-driven user identification & tracking to create dynamically adjusting ‘zones’ within a facility, coupled with targeted, personalized micro-advertising displayed on strategically placed digital displays.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Network:** Expand beyond simple entry/exit detection. Implement a dense network of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons *and* low-resolution cameras (for basic shape/object recognition, *not* facial recognition) throughout the facility.  Focus is on proximity & dwell time, not identification.
*   **Zoning Algorithm:**
    *   Facility is initially divided into coarse zones (e.g., “Produce”, “Dairy”, “Frozen”).
    *   Real-time data from BLE beacons & cameras tracks user dwell time & path.
    *   Algorithm dynamically subdivides zones based on user density & traffic patterns.  For example, if a particular aisle in “Produce” becomes crowded, it splits into “Apple Aisle” and “Orange Aisle”.
    *   Zone creation is ephemeral – zones dissolve when traffic returns to normal.
*   **Digital Display Network:** Small, high-resolution displays (6” - 8”) strategically positioned throughout the facility – aisle ends, near popular items, checkout lines.
*   **Content Delivery System:**
    *   Integrates with the zoning algorithm and user tracking.
    *   Content is dynamically selected based on:
        *   **Zone:** Content relevant to the current zone (e.g., recipe for apples in “Apple Aisle”).
        *   **User Profile:** Based on historical shopping data (if available – opt-in required). If no history, default to broad demographic targeting.
        *   **Real-time Context:** Display promotions for items currently in high demand.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   Edge Computing:  Sensor data processing & zoning calculations performed locally on edge servers within the facility to minimize latency.
    *   Cloud Integration: Aggregate data sent to the cloud for analytics & model training.

**Pseudocode (Zoning Algorithm):**

```
// Define initial coarse zones
zones = [“Produce”, “Dairy”, “Frozen”]

// Sensor Data Input (Beacon ID, User ID, Timestamp, Location)
function processSensorData(data) {
  // Update user location in real-time map
  updateUserLocation(data.UserID, data.Location)

  // Calculate density in each zone
  zoneDensities = calculateZoneDensity()

  // If density in a zone exceeds threshold
  if (zoneDensities[zone] > densityThreshold) {
    // Subdivide the zone
    newZones = subdivideZone(zone) // Algorithm to identify subdivision points (e.g., based on item categories)
    zones.append(newZones)
  }

  // If zone density falls below threshold
  if (zoneDensities[zone] < densityThreshold) {
    // Merge zones or revert to parent zone
    mergeZones(zone)
  }
}

function calculateZoneDensity() {
  // Count number of users within each zone
  // Return a dictionary of zone:density
}

function subdivideZone(zone) {
  // Identify items within the zone
  // Create new zones based on item categories
  // Return a list of new zone names
}

function mergeZones(zone) {
  // Remove the zone from the list of zones
  // Add users to the parent zone
}
```
