## Adaptive Key-Value Hierarchy with Temporal Versioning

**Specification:**

**Core Concept:** Extend the hierarchical key-value store to natively support temporal versioning of directory structures *and* associated data. This isn’t just about tracking changes *to* the hierarchy, but treating the hierarchy *itself* as data subject to versioning.

**Components:**

*   **Temporal Key-Value Store:** The base key-value store with modifications. Each key will include a timestamp component representing the version.
*   **Hierarchy Definition Keys:** Keys representing directory structures.  These keys include a version timestamp.  Example: `/project/marketing/2024-10-27T14:30:00Z`.  The value associated with this key is a list of child directory keys *also* with version timestamps.
*   **Data Keys:**  Keys representing actual data objects. These keys are *linked* to a specific hierarchy version. Example: `data:report_2023.pdf@/project/marketing/2024-10-27T14:30:00Z`. This indicates the file `report_2023.pdf` is associated with the specified directory version.
*   **Version Resolver Service:** A service responsible for resolving requests to the correct version of the hierarchy and data.  This handles requests for “current” or specific historical states.
*   **Change Log:** A persistent log capturing all changes to the hierarchy (creates, deletes, modifications).  This powers the versioning and rollback features.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Hierarchy Creation:** When a new directory is created, a new key is created in the key-value store with a timestamp representing the creation time. The value is initially an empty list of children. The change is logged.
2.  **Data Storage:** When data is stored, it is associated with a specific hierarchy version using the `data:filename@hierarchy_version` key format.
3.  **Version Retrieval:** A client requests data. The Version Resolver Service determines the target hierarchy version (e.g., “current”, “2024-10-26T00:00:00Z”).
4.  **Resolution:** The service resolves the data key, considering the specified hierarchy version. If the requested hierarchy version doesn't exist, an error is returned.
5.  **Rollback/History:**  The Change Log allows for rollback to previous states. The system can reconstruct a hierarchy at any point in time.

**Pseudocode (Version Resolver Service):**

```
function resolveData(dataKey, hierarchyVersion):
  if hierarchyVersion == "current":
    hierarchyVersion = getLatestHierarchyVersion() // Find the most recent version
  
  if not hierarchyExists(hierarchyVersion):
    return Error("Hierarchy version not found")
  
  if dataKey.startsWith("data:"):
    filename = dataKey.substring(5)
    expectedHierarchy = dataKey.substring(dataKey.indexOf("@") + 1)
    if expectedHierarchy != hierarchyVersion:
        return Error("Data key does not match expected hierarchy version")
    
    dataLocation = getKey(dataKey) // Fetch data location from key-value store
    return dataLocation
  else:
    //This implies a directory request
    children = getKey(hierarchyVersion)
    return children
```

**Considerations:**

*   **Storage Overhead:**  Versioning inherently increases storage requirements.  Compression and garbage collection strategies are vital.
*   **Concurrency:**  Robust locking mechanisms are necessary to handle concurrent access and modifications.
*   **API Design:** The API must provide clear mechanisms for specifying hierarchy versions and performing time-based queries.
*   **Scalability:** The key-value store must be able to handle the increased load and complexity.
