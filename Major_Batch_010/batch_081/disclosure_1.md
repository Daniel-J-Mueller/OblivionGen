## Dynamic Graph Pruning with Predictive Edge Weighting

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical clustering approach to incorporate a predictive model for edge weights, allowing for dynamic pruning of the graph during construction *before* spanning tree generation, leading to significantly reduced computational cost and improved scalability, particularly with large, dense datasets.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Structures:**

*   `Entity`: Represents a node in the graph. Contains:
    *   `id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `features`: Vector of numerical features.
*   `Edge`: Represents a connection between entities. Contains:
    *   `source_id`: ID of the source entity.
    *   `target_id`: ID of the target entity.
    *   `similarity_score`: Initial similarity score.
    *   `predicted_weight`: Weight assigned by the predictive model.
    *   `active`: Boolean flag indicating if the edge is currently included in the graph.
*   `Cluster`: A collection of `Entity` nodes.
*   `Graph`: A collection of `Entity` nodes and `Edge` objects.

**II. Predictive Model:**

*   **Type:** A gradient-boosted decision tree (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) trained on historical edge data.
*   **Features:**
    *   Original `similarity_score`.
    *   Feature vector difference between source and target entities.
    *   Node degree (number of connections) of both source and target entities.
    *   Cluster assignment (if available) of source and target entities.
*   **Output:** A probability score indicating the likelihood that an edge is ‘important’ for maintaining cluster coherence.
*   **Training:** The model is trained offline on a representative dataset. Retraining can be performed periodically or triggered by significant data drift.

**III. Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a `Graph` from the initial `Entity` pairs and their `similarity_score`.
    *   Train the predictive model.
2.  **Iterative Clustering:** For each analysis iteration:
    *   **Edge Weight Prediction:** For each `Edge` in the `Graph`:
        *   Compute features for the predictive model.
        *   Predict the `predicted_weight` using the trained model.
    *   **Dynamic Pruning:**
        *   Establish a `pruning_threshold`. This value is configurable, and can be dynamically adjusted based on the iteration number or a performance metric (e.g., reduction in graph size).
        *   For each `Edge`:
            *   If `predicted_weight` < `pruning_threshold`:
                *   Set `active` = False.
                *   Remove the edge from consideration in subsequent steps.
    *   **Subset Selection:** Select the subset of *active* edges with the highest similarity scores.
    *   **Cluster Formation:** Generate clusters from the selected edges using a connected components algorithm (parallelizable).
    *   **Spanning Tree Generation:** Generate a spanning tree for each cluster (parallelizable).
    *   **Hierarchical Representation Update:** Add edges from the spanning trees to the accumulated representation. Add a representative node for each cluster.
    *   **Iteration Termination:** Stop when a predefined number of iterations is reached or the graph size falls below a threshold.

**IV. Parallelization:**

*   Edge weight prediction can be parallelized using multiple threads or processes.
*   Dynamic pruning can also be parallelized.
*   Cluster formation and spanning tree generation are inherently parallelizable.

**V. Pseudocode (Pruning Step):**

```
FOR each edge IN graph:
    features = compute_edge_features(edge)
    predicted_weight = predict(features, model)

    IF predicted_weight < pruning_threshold:
        edge.active = False
        remove edge from active_edges_list
END FOR

# Subsequent steps operate on active_edges_list only.
```

**VI. Potential Benefits:**

*   **Scalability:** Significantly reduced graph size leads to improved scalability with large datasets.
*   **Performance:** Reduced computational cost for cluster formation and spanning tree generation.
*   **Adaptability:** The predictive model can adapt to changing data patterns.
*   **Reduced Noise:** Eliminates less important edges, improving the quality of the hierarchical representation.
