## Dynamic Narrative Weaving with AI-Driven Prop Synthesis

**Concept:** Extend the system’s ability to integrate client-generated content beyond simple asset replacement to include dynamically generated narrative elements – ‘props’ – woven into the existing canon. This creates emergent storytelling possibilities and deeper client immersion.

**Specifications:**

**1. Prop Definition & Metadata:**

*   Introduce a "Prop Template" system within the MU database. These templates define prop *types* (e.g., “Mysterious Letter”, “Ancient Artifact”, “Broken Weapon”).
*   Each template includes:
    *   A base 3D model/visual representation.
    *   A set of narrative “seed” parameters (e.g., “Sender”, “Recipient”, “Purpose”, “Age”).
    *   A linked Large Language Model (LLM) configured for narrative generation.
    *   A weighting system for relevance to existing canon elements (locations, characters, events).
    *   A 'mutation' probability – the likelihood the LLM will deviate from established lore, creating genuinely new story elements.
*   Client-generated content can *become* prop templates or contribute parameters *to* existing templates.

**2.  Prop Synthesis Engine:**

*   A dedicated module responsible for creating and integrating props into the digital media.
*   When a client interacts with a designated trigger (e.g., exploring a location, completing a quest), the engine:
    1.  Selects a relevant prop template based on context and client history.
    2.  Populates the template’s seed parameters with data from client actions, preferences, and existing canon.
    3.  Queries the linked LLM to generate a unique narrative description for the prop. This description incorporates the seeded parameters and existing lore.
    4.  Generates a visual representation of the prop (e.g., applying textures, generating minor variations on the base model).
    5.  Integrates the prop into the scene – dynamically placing it in the environment and adding associated interactions.

**3.  Dynamic Interaction & Quest Generation:**

*   Props are not static. They should possess interactive elements (e.g., readable text, unlockable containers, triggerable events).
*   The Prop Synthesis Engine can dynamically generate simple quests tied to the props – creating emergent gameplay opportunities.  (e.g., "A Mysterious Letter hints at a hidden treasure.  Follow the clues to find it.")
*   Client actions related to props should feed back into the system – influencing future prop generation and quest design.

**4.  Canonical Integration & Community Voting:**

*   Props initially exist as client-specific content.
*   The system tracks client interactions with props (e.g., number of reads, completion of associated quests).
*   Community voting allows players to promote props to intermediate layers or even the base layer of the MU database.
*   High-ranking props become part of the shared canon – influencing the experience for all players.

**Pseudocode (Prop Synthesis Engine):**

```
function synthesizeProp(client, location, context):
  propTemplate = selectRelevantTemplate(location, context, clientHistory)
  if propTemplate == null:
    return null

  parameters = populateParameters(propTemplate, client, context)
  narrative = generateNarrative(propTemplate.llm, parameters)
  visual = generateVisual(propTemplate.baseModel, narrative)

  prop = createPropInstance(visual, narrative)
  placePropInScene(prop, location)

  return prop
```

**Expansion Points:**

*   **Prop "Ecosystems":** Link props together to create small, interconnected storylines.
*   **Procedural Prop Creation:** Allow the LLM to generate entirely new prop templates based on client requests.
*   **AI-Driven Prop Actors:** Give props simple AI behaviors – allowing them to move, interact, and respond to player actions.
