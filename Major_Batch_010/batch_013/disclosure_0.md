**Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) Integration for Proactive Fault Prediction & Localization**

**Concept:** Augment the existing OTDR-based fault detection system with a distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) system operating *concurrently* on the same fiber link. This creates a multi-modal sensing approach, allowing for prediction of faults *before* they manifest as signal degradation detectable by the OTDR, as well as incredibly precise fault localization.

**Specs:**

*   **DAS Unit:** High-sensitivity DAS interrogator unit. Target resolution: 1 meter or less. Operational frequency range: 1 Hz – 20 kHz (adjustable).
*   **Fiber Integration:** Utilize a dedicated, single-mode fiber running *alongside* the existing communication fiber(s). This eliminates interference with the communication signal and allows for continuous DAS monitoring.  Alternatively, a WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexer) may be used to coexist on the same fiber, but performance trade-offs must be evaluated.
*   **Data Acquisition & Synchronization:** DAS unit and OTDR are time-synchronized via PTP (Precision Time Protocol) or similar protocol.  DAS data is streamed continuously, while OTDR measurements are triggered periodically (e.g., every 15 minutes).
*   **Signal Processing – Feature Extraction:**  Extract acoustic features from the DAS data:
    *   **Strain Analysis:** Detect subtle fiber strain changes indicating stress buildup (e.g., due to temperature fluctuations, ground movement, cable tension).
    *   **Vibration Analysis:** Identify external vibrations impacting the fiber (e.g., construction, traffic, animal activity).  Apply FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to detect frequency components.
    *   **Acoustic Emission Analysis:** Detect high-frequency acoustic signals associated with material degradation (e.g., microcracking in fiber splices, connector corrosion).
*   **Machine Learning Model – Fault Prediction:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM recurrent neural network, Random Forest) to predict potential faults based on the extracted acoustic features and historical OTDR data. Inputs: Acoustic feature vectors, OTDR signature history, environmental data (temperature, humidity). Output: Fault probability score, estimated time to failure.
*   **Localization Enhancement:** Fuse DAS data with OTDR data for improved fault localization accuracy. DAS can pinpoint the location of acoustic events (e.g., cable movement, microcracks) with sub-meter resolution.
*   **Network Controller Integration:** Modify the existing network controller to:
    *   Receive and process DAS data.
    *   Execute the machine learning model.
    *   Correlate DAS-predicted faults with OTDR measurements.
    *   Generate proactive fault alerts with high precision.
    *   Log DAS and OTDR data for long-term trend analysis and model retraining.
*   **Alarm Prioritization:** Implement an alarm prioritization scheme based on the combined fault probability score from the machine learning model and the severity of the detected acoustic event.
*   **Data Storage:** Utilize a distributed data storage system for storing DAS and OTDR data.

**Pseudocode (Network Controller – Fault Prediction):**

```
FUNCTION PredictFault(DAS_Data, OTDR_History, Environmental_Data):
  // Feature Extraction
  Features = ExtractFeatures(DAS_Data)

  // Fault Probability Calculation
  Probability = MachineLearningModel.Predict(Features, OTDR_History, Environmental_Data)

  RETURN Probability
```

```
FUNCTION ProcessDataLoop():
  WHILE TRUE:
    DAS_Data = ReceiveDASData()
    OTDR_History = GetHistoricalOTDRData()
    Environmental_Data = GetEnvironmentalData()

    Probability = PredictFault(DAS_Data, OTDR_History, Environmental_Data)

    IF Probability > Threshold:
      GenerateAlert(Probability)
      LogAlert()
    ENDIF

    LogData(DAS_Data, OTDR_History, Environmental_Data)
  ENDWHILE
ENDFUNCTION
```

This approach moves beyond reactive fault detection to proactive fault prediction and precise localization. Combining DAS with existing OTDR technology provides a robust, multi-layered system for ensuring network reliability and minimizing downtime.
