## Autonomous Vehicle Passenger-Driven Environmental Mapping & Prediction

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** “Echo Mapping” – A system enabling passengers to actively contribute to a dynamic, layered environmental map utilized for predictive navigation.
*   **Sensory Input:**
    *   High-resolution, multi-spectral (visible, thermal, near-infrared) cameras positioned to capture passenger gaze direction.
    *   Biometric sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance) integrated into passenger seating to detect attentional focus and emotional response.
    *   In-cabin microphone array for capturing passenger vocalizations (explicit commentary or subtle cues indicating awareness of environmental features).
*   **Data Processing:**
    *   **Gaze Tracking & Feature Extraction:** Algorithms analyze passenger gaze to identify specific objects or areas of interest within the vehicle's sensory field.
    *   **Bio-Signal Correlation:** Correlation of biometric data with gaze tracking to weight the significance of detected features. High attention/emotional response boosts feature importance.
    *   **Acoustic Event Detection:** Analysis of in-cabin audio for keywords (e.g., "pothole," "construction," "pedestrian") or emotionally indicative vocalizations.
    *   **Layered Map Generation:** The system builds a multi-layered map including:
        *   *Static Layer:* Traditional map data (roads, buildings).
        *   *Dynamic Layer:* Real-time sensor data (traffic, weather).
        *   *Passenger-Annotated Layer:* Features identified and weighted based on passenger input. This layer is a probabilistic distribution – not definitive data, but indications of potential hazards or points of interest.
*   **Predictive Navigation Algorithm:**
    *   Integrates data from all layers.
    *   Assigns “hazard scores” to potential navigation paths based on the Passenger-Annotated Layer.
    *   Prioritizes paths with lower hazard scores.
    *   Provides optional explanations to passengers regarding path selection (“Adjusting route due to potential hazard identified by passenger”).
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Augmented Reality display projected onto the windshield.
    *   Visualizations of passenger-identified features overlaid onto the live video feed.
    *   Interactive elements allowing passengers to confirm, reject, or add to the map.
    *   Option to "share" map annotations with other vehicles in the network.
*   **Network Communication:**
    *   Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication protocol for sharing Passenger-Annotated Layers.
    *   Cloud-based storage and analysis of aggregated data for improved map accuracy and hazard prediction.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Hazard Scoring):**

```
function calculateHazardScore(path, passengerData):
  hazardScore = 0
  for feature in path.features:
    if feature in passengerData.identifiedHazards:
      weight = passengerData.getAttentionWeight(feature)
      hazardScore += weight * feature.severity
    else:
      hazardScore += feature.baseSeverity //default

  return hazardScore

function selectNavigationPath(availablePaths, passengerData):
  bestPath = null
  lowestHazardScore = infinity

  for path in availablePaths:
    hazardScore = calculateHazardScore(path, passengerData)
    if hazardScore < lowestHazardScore:
      lowestHazardScore = hazardScore
      bestPath = path

  return bestPath
```

**Novelty:**

The core innovation lies in actively leveraging *passenger perception* as a real-time data source for environmental mapping and hazard prediction. Traditional autonomous vehicle systems rely primarily on sensors and pre-existing map data. This system treats passengers not as passive occupants but as additional, potentially valuable sensors, improving situational awareness and potentially preventing accidents. It also uses biometric data to refine the inputs.
