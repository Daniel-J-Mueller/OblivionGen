## Adaptive Network Resonance Testing

**Concept:** Extend the existing network testing framework by incorporating ‘resonance’ testing – identifying and characterizing subtle impedance mismatches or signal degradation *before* they manifest as failures. Think of it as listening for the ‘hum’ of a network before the engine seizes. This leverages the fact that even minor physical layer issues create measurable signal characteristics.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Resonance Signal Generation Module:**
    *   Function: Generates a modulated carrier wave sweeping through a pre-defined frequency range (configurable by admin – 1MHz – 1GHz suggested).
    *   Modulation:  Phase-Shift Keying (PSK) for sensitivity to signal phase changes.
    *   Output: Transmitted simultaneously across *both* interfaces of the selected pair of devices.

2.  **Impedance/Signal Analysis Engine:**
    *   Location: Integrated into the existing server infrastructure.
    *   Function: Receives reflected signals (using Time-Domain Reflectometry principles) and performs Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to identify resonant frequencies and impedance mismatches.
    *   Metrics: Reports:
        *   Resonance Frequency (Hz)
        *   Impedance Magnitude (Ohms)
        *   Phase Shift (Degrees)
        *   Signal-to-Noise Ratio (dB) at resonance.
    *   Algorithm: A custom algorithm to differentiate between acceptable impedance variations (due to cable length/quality) and potentially problematic mismatches.  This includes a dynamic baseline calibration procedure using known good connections.

3.  **Test Plan Integration:**
    *   New Test Step: ‘Resonance Scan’.  Configurable parameters: frequency range, scan duration, sensitivity threshold.
    *   Placement: The Resonance Scan should occur *before* standard IP connectivity tests. This allows for pre-emptive identification of issues.
    *   Automated Failure Detection: The system will automatically flag a connection as potentially problematic if the impedance deviates beyond a configurable threshold.

4.  **Data Visualization & Reporting:**
    *   Graphical representation of impedance spectra.
    *   Color-coded severity levels based on the severity of impedance mismatch.
    *   Historical tracking of impedance data to identify trends and predict potential failures.
    *   Integration with the existing reporting system.

**Pseudocode (Server Side – Resonance Scan Execution):**

```
FUNCTION ExecuteResonanceScan(devicePair)
  // devicePair = {deviceA, deviceB}

  // 1. Configure devices for Resonance Test Mode (via API call)
  deviceA.SetTestMode(mode="resonance")
  deviceB.SetTestMode(mode="resonance")

  // 2. Initiate Signal Transmission
  server.TransmitResonanceSignal(devicePair)

  // 3. Capture Reflected Signals from both devices
  signalA = deviceA.ReceiveReflectedSignal()
  signalB = deviceB.ReceiveReflectedSignal()

  // 4. Perform FFT Analysis on received signals
  spectrumA = FFT(signalA)
  spectrumB = FFT(signalB)

  // 5. Identify Resonance Frequencies & Impedance from spectrum
  resonanceA = FindResonancePeak(spectrumA)
  resonanceB = FindResonancePeak(spectrumB)

  impedanceA = CalculateImpedance(resonanceA)
  impedanceB = CalculateImpedance(resonanceB)

  // 6. Compare Impedance to Baseline/Threshold
  IF (impedanceA > impedanceThreshold OR impedanceB > impedanceThreshold) THEN
    Report("Potential Physical Layer Issue Detected - Impedance: " + impedanceA + ", " + impedanceB)
    // Trigger Further Investigation/Alert
  ENDIF

  // 7. Reset Devices to Normal Operation
  deviceA.ResetToNormalOperation()
  deviceB.ResetToNormalOperation()

END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**  While network testing often focuses on Layer 3 and above, this approach dives into the physical layer *before* connectivity is established, leveraging signal analysis techniques not typically found in this context. This allows for proactive identification of issues before they impact network performance. It's akin to preventative maintenance on a microscopic scale.
