## Dynamic Network Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic address mapping described in the patent to incorporate 'network personas' for computing nodes. A persona encapsulates not just network addresses, but also security policies, quality of service (QoS) settings, and application-specific configurations. These personas can be dynamically assigned and switched based on context (user, application, time of day, threat level, etc.).

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Definition:** A persona is a data structure containing:
    *   Virtual Network Address(es)
    *   Substrate Network Address(es)
    *   Security Policy (firewall rules, access control lists)
    *   QoS Parameters (bandwidth allocation, priority)
    *   Application-Specific Configuration (port mappings, data formats)
    *   Activation Conditions (user ID, application name, time window, security level)

*   **Persona Manager Module:** A new module responsible for:
    *   Storing and managing personas.
    *   Applying personas to computing nodes based on activation conditions.
    *   Dynamically updating network addresses and configurations.
    *   Monitoring persona health and performance.

*   **Communication Manager Adaptation:** The existing Communication Manager must be modified to:
    *   Query the Persona Manager for the active persona of a destination node.
    *   Enforce security policies and QoS settings specified in the persona.
    *   Adapt communication protocols based on persona configurations.

*   **Persona Activation Flow:**
    1.  A computing node requests a persona from the Persona Manager (or is automatically assigned one).
    2.  The Persona Manager verifies activation conditions.
    3.  If conditions are met, the Persona Manager assigns the persona.
    4.  The Communication Manager receives the persona assignment and configures the node accordingly.
    5.  The Persona Manager monitors the persona's health and performance.

*   **Dynamic Persona Switching:**  The Persona Manager can dynamically switch personas based on changing conditions.  For example:
    *   A user accessing a sensitive application could be assigned a highly secure persona.
    *   A node experiencing high network congestion could be assigned a persona with lower bandwidth allocation.
    *   A compromised node could be automatically assigned an isolated persona to prevent further damage.

**Pseudocode (Persona Manager â€“ Assign Persona):**

```
function AssignPersona(nodeID, requestedPersona):
  // Check if the requestedPersona is valid and exists
  if (PersonaExists(requestedPersona) == false):
    return ERROR_INVALID_PERSONA

  // Evaluate activation conditions
  if (EvaluateActivationConditions(requestedPersona, nodeID) == false):
    return ERROR_ACTIVATION_FAILED

  // Apply Persona Configuration to Node
  ApplyPersonaConfiguration(nodeID, requestedPersona)

  // Update Node's Active Persona
  SetNodeActivePersona(nodeID, requestedPersona)

  return SUCCESS
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Driven Persona Recommendation:** Use machine learning to predict optimal personas based on user behavior, application requirements, and network conditions.
*   **Persona Chaining:** Allow multiple personas to be chained together, creating complex configurations.
*   **Persona Marketplace:** Enable users to create and share personas with each other.
