## Adaptive Resonance Singulation with Dynamic Morphology

**Concept:** Expand upon the singulation table’s ability to adapt to diverse item shapes and sizes by incorporating a dynamic, reconfigurable surface built from small, individually controllable elements. This creates a “smart” singulation surface capable of *resonating* with the item's vibrational profile to facilitate separation and orientation.

**Specs:**

*   **Surface Element:** Hexagonal or square tiles, approximately 2cm x 2cm x 1cm. Material: a polymer composite with embedded piezoelectric actuators. Each tile is individually addressable.
*   **Actuation:** Each tile’s height is controlled by its piezoelectric actuator, allowing for localized changes in surface topography.  Control range: 0-5mm vertical displacement.
*   **Sensing:** Each tile integrates a capacitive proximity sensor to detect the presence and proximity of items.
*   **Control System:** A central controller linked to each tile. The controller receives input from item detection sensors (cameras, LiDAR) and calculates optimal tile configurations to achieve singulation.
*   **Singulation Algorithms:**
    1.  **Vibration Profile Analysis:** When an item is detected, an algorithm analyzes its dimensions, estimated weight, and material properties (using image analysis/spectroscopy if available). This estimates the item’s natural resonant frequencies.
    2.  **Resonance Mapping:** The controller dynamically adjusts the height of adjacent tiles to create a localized vibrational “well” that matches the item’s resonant frequency.  This causes the item to gently lift and separate from adjacent items.
    3.  **Directed Migration:** By selectively adjusting the height of tiles in a directional pattern, the item is guided along the singulation table towards the pick conveyor. A “wave” of localized vibrations could propel the item.
    4.  **Adaptive Morphology:** The system continuously monitors item movement and adjusts tile configurations in real-time to compensate for variations in item size, shape, and friction.
*   **Table Structure:** The singulation table consists of a matrix of these dynamic tiles. The density of tiles can be varied based on the anticipated range of item sizes and shapes.
*   **Power/Data Interface:** Each tile is powered and controlled via a grid of micro-connectors embedded within the table structure. Wireless communication (e.g., LoRa) is also an option.
*   **Material Selection:** Tile materials must be non-marking, non-static, and compatible with a wide range of item materials.
*   **Software Architecture:** Modular, object-oriented design. Algorithms for vibration profile analysis, resonance mapping, and directed migration are implemented as separate modules.  Open API for integration with existing robotic systems.

**Pseudocode - Resonance Mapping Algorithm:**

```
FUNCTION MapResonance(item_data, tile_matrix):
  // item_data contains dimensions, weight, estimated resonant frequencies
  // tile_matrix is a 2D array representing the singulation table tiles

  target_frequency = item_data.resonant_frequency
  
  FOR each tile in tile_matrix:
    tile.height = 0 // initialize tile height
  
  // Calculate initial tile height configuration based on item shape
  FOR i FROM 0 TO tile_matrix.width:
    FOR j FROM 0 TO tile_matrix.height:
      distance = CalculateDistance(item_center, tile_center(i, j))
      tile_height(i, j) = SineWave(distance, target_frequency, amplitude) // Generate a sine wave profile

  // Refine tile configuration based on item response (real-time feedback)
  WHILE item_not_singulated:
    ReadSensorData(tile_matrix) // Get item proximity and movement data
    AdjustTileHeights(tile_matrix, sensor_data) // Modify tile heights based on sensor data
    Delay(0.01 seconds)

  ENDWHILE

  Return tile_matrix
```

This system aims to go beyond simple vibration and friction to actively shape the singulation surface around each item, maximizing separation and orientation efficiency.  It allows for handling of items with vastly different properties and complexities.
