## Dynamic Task Composition via Learned Behavioral Policies

**Concept:** Extend dynamic task discovery to incorporate *behavioral policies* learned from workflow execution data. Instead of simply selecting a task *version*, the system dynamically *composes* a task from a library of modular behavioral components. This allows for far more fine-grained adaptation to runtime conditions and complex workflow needs.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Component Library:**

*   **Structure:** A repository of self-contained behavioral components. Each component encapsulates a specific function or logical step (e.g., data validation, transformation, external API call, error handling).
*   **Interface:** Components expose a standardized interface defined by:
    *   `input_schema`:  Specification of accepted input data types and structure.
    *   `output_schema`: Specification of produced output data types and structure.
    *   `execution_cost`: Estimated resource usage (CPU, memory, time).
    *   `dependencies`: List of required external resources or services.
*   **Metadata:**  Each component stores metadata detailing its purpose, author, version, and performance characteristics.

**2. Policy Learning Engine:**

*   **Data Source:** Workflow execution logs, including input data, selected task versions, execution times, resource usage, and outcomes.
*   **Learning Algorithm:** Reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised learning (SL) to train a policy that maps workflow states (represented by input data and context) to optimal sequences of behavioral components.
*   **Policy Representation:**  A neural network or decision tree that outputs a ranked list of component sequences, along with associated confidence scores.
*   **Training Process:** Online learning to continuously improve the policy based on real-time workflow data.

**3. Dynamic Composition Engine:**

*   **Input:** Workflow task definition, input data, current workflow state, and learned policy.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Extract features from input data and workflow state.
    2.  Query the learned policy for a ranked list of component sequences.
    3.  Filter sequences based on resource availability and dependencies.
    4.  Evaluate the execution cost and estimated completion time of remaining sequences.
    5.  Select the optimal sequence based on a defined optimization function (e.g., minimize completion time, maximize resource utilization).
    6.  Dynamically compose the selected sequence into a runnable task.
*   **Output:** A dynamically composed task, ready for execution by a task worker node.

**4. Task Worker Node Enhancement:**

*   **Component Execution:**  Ability to execute individual behavioral components in a specified order.
*   **State Management:** Maintain and pass state between components within a composed task.
*   **Monitoring & Reporting:** Track execution metrics for each component and report back to the Policy Learning Engine.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Composition Engine):**

```python
def compose_task(task_definition, input_data, workflow_state, policy_model):
    features = extract_features(input_data, workflow_state)
    ranked_sequences = policy_model.predict(features)  # Returns list of (sequence, confidence)

    valid_sequences = []
    for sequence, confidence in ranked_sequences:
        if can_execute(sequence):  # Check resource availability, dependencies
            valid_sequences.append((sequence, confidence))

    if not valid_sequences:
        # Fallback to default task version
        return default_task_version()

    best_sequence, best_confidence = max(valid_sequences, key=lambda x: x[1] / estimate_cost(x[0]))

    composed_task = create_task(best_sequence)
    return composed_task
```

**Novelty:**

This system goes beyond simply choosing a pre-defined task version. It allows for the *creation* of tasks on-the-fly, tailored to specific runtime conditions. By leveraging learned behavioral policies, the system can adapt to complex workflow requirements and optimize performance in ways that are not possible with static task definitions. This facilitates a degree of autonomous workflow management.
