## Proactive Meeting Context & Preparation

**Concept:** Extend the voice-controlled meeting join system to *proactively* gather relevant context for the meeting *before* the user joins, and present a concise, actionable briefing. This goes beyond simply joining the call; it prepares the user.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Calendar Event Details (Attendees, Agenda, Location/Link)
    *   Recent Email Communication (last 24-48hrs) – focusing on threads *including* meeting attendees.
    *   Recent Document Access (last 24-48hrs) – documents shared *within* those email threads or specifically linked in the calendar event.
    *   Internal Communication Platforms (Slack/Teams) – Recent channels with meeting attendees.
*   **Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  **Trigger:** User voice command ("Join my meeting," or a more specific command like "Join the project X meeting").
    2.  **Meeting Identification:** System identifies the meeting as per the patent description.
    3.  **Contextual Data Retrieval:** System queries data sources (listed above) for relevant information.
    4.  **AI-Powered Summarization:** An LLM summarizes the retrieved data into the following sections:
        *   **Key Attendees:** Names and roles of key participants.
        *   **Recent Discussion:** 3-5 bullet points summarizing recent email/chat conversations.
        *   **Relevant Documents:** List of 2-3 most relevant documents with brief descriptions.
        *   **Action Items:** Identified action items from recent discussions, assigned to the user or requiring user input.
    5.  **Audio Presentation:**  System generates a synthesized voice briefing based on the summarized data. (Estimated duration: 30-60 seconds). This is *before* the meeting audio is connected.
        *Example:* “You’re joining the Project X meeting. Key attendees are Sarah Chen, Lead Engineer, and David Lee, Project Manager. Recent discussion focused on the budget allocation for Phase 2. The revised budget document is available. You have an action item to review the marketing plan by end of day.”
    6.  **Interactive Options:** After the briefing, the system offers options:
        *   “Open relevant documents”
        *   “Mark action items as complete”
        *   “Skip briefing and join meeting”
*   **Voice Control Integration:** The user can control the briefing using voice commands:
    *   “Pause”
    *   “Repeat”
    *   “More details on [topic]”
    *   “Skip”
*   **Device Integration:** Compatible with existing voice-controlled devices (smart speakers, headsets, conference room systems).

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION proactiveMeetingBriefing(voiceCommand, userIdentity):
  meeting = identifyMeeting(voiceCommand, userIdentity)
  IF meeting == NULL:
    RETURN "No meeting found."

  data = gatherMeetingContext(meeting, userIdentity)
  summary = summarizeContext(data)
  audioBriefing = generateAudio(summary)
  playAudio(audioBriefing)

  options = ["Open documents", "Mark complete", "Skip"]
  displayOptions(options)

  userResponse = await getUserResponse()

  IF userResponse == "Open documents":
    openRelevantDocuments(meeting)
  ELSE IF userResponse == "Mark complete":
    markActionItemsComplete(meeting)
  ELSE:
    joinMeeting(meeting)
```
