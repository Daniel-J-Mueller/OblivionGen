**Dynamic Threat Landscape Mapping & Predictive Alerting**

**Concept:** Extend the existing system to actively map and predict evolving threat landscapes *before* alerts are triggered, using a combination of external threat intelligence feeds, internal network behavior analysis, and a novel ‘behavioral drift’ detection mechanism.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component 1: External Threat Aggregator:**
    *   Interface with multiple, diverse external threat intelligence feeds (e.g., MISP, VirusTotal, Shadowserver, commercial feeds).
    *   Normalize data formats and scoring systems.
    *   Employ a weighted scoring system based on source reliability, data age, and relevance to the organization’s assets.
    *   Output: A continuously updated ‘threat landscape’ graph, representing known threats and their characteristics.
*   **Component 2: Internal Behavioral Baseline:**
    *   Continuously monitor network traffic, user activity, and system logs.
    *   Establish a dynamic baseline of ‘normal’ behavior for each organizational unit (OU) and individual asset.
    *   Utilize machine learning (specifically, anomaly detection algorithms like autoencoders or one-class SVMs) to identify deviations from the baseline.
*   **Component 3: Behavioral Drift Detector:**
    *   Monitor changes in internal behavior *before* they trigger traditional alerts.
    *   Calculate a ‘drift score’ for each OU and asset, representing the degree of deviation from the established baseline.
    *   Employ time-series analysis to identify trends and predict future drift.
    *   Thresholds and weighting based on organizational risk profile.
*   **Component 4: Predictive Alerting Engine:**
    *   Correlate data from the External Threat Aggregator, Internal Behavioral Baseline, and Behavioral Drift Detector.
    *   Utilize a Bayesian network to model the relationships between threats, vulnerabilities, and internal behavior.
    *   Generate ‘pre-alerts’ based on the probability of a future attack, even if no immediate threat is detected. These pre-alerts indicate a potential *increase* in risk.
    *   Adjust the sensitivity of existing threat intelligence rules based on the predictive risk score.
*   **Component 5: Adaptive Rule Adjustment:**
    *   Automatically adjusts threat intelligence rule sensitivity based on pre-alert scores. If a pre-alert score is high, rule sensitivity increases, leading to more frequent (but potentially false positive) alerts.
    *   If a pre-alert score is low, rule sensitivity decreases, reducing alert fatigue.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  External Threat Aggregator feeds data into the Bayesian Network.
    2.  Internal Behavioral Baseline and Behavioral Drift Detector feed data into the Bayesian Network.
    3.  Bayesian Network calculates a predictive risk score for each OU and asset.
    4.  Predictive Alerting Engine generates pre-alerts and adjusts threat intelligence rule sensitivity.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Risk Score Calculation):**

```
function calculatePredictiveRiskScore(OU, asset) {
  externalThreatScore = getExternalThreatScore(OU, asset);
  behavioralDriftScore = getBehavioralDriftScore(OU, asset);

  // Bayesian Network (simplified example)
  riskScore = (weightExternalThreat * externalThreatScore) + (weightDrift * behavioralDriftScore)

  return riskScore
}
```

**Novelty:**

The system goes beyond reactive alert correlation. It proactively anticipates threats by identifying subtle changes in internal behavior *before* they escalate into full-blown attacks. This allows for early intervention and reduces the overall risk profile. The Bayesian network approach enables a more nuanced and accurate assessment of risk, considering both external threats and internal vulnerabilities. The adaptive rule adjustment minimizes alert fatigue while maximizing detection effectiveness.
