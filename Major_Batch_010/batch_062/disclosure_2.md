## Adaptive Granularity Explanations with Knowledge Graph Integration

**Concept:** Expand the system to dynamically adjust explanation granularity *based on user cognitive load* and integrate a knowledge graph to enrich explanations with contextual information. The current patent focuses on token grouping and influence scores, but doesn’t address *how* that information is presented to a user in an optimal way, or *what* additional information could be provided to improve understanding.

**Specs:**

1.  **Cognitive Load Sensor Integration:**
    *   **Input:** Integrate data from a user’s cognitive load sensor (e.g., EEG headset, eye-tracking, keystroke dynamics). This data should quantify the user’s mental effort.
    *   **Processing:** Implement an algorithm to map cognitive load levels to explanation granularity.
        *   **High Load:** Present highly aggregated explanations – focus on broad concepts, simplified token groupings (e.g., noun phrases only), and minimal details.
        *   **Medium Load:** Utilize the current system’s granularity controls, allowing users to select desired levels of detail.
        *   **Low Load:** Offer highly detailed explanations, including individual tokens, parse tree visualizations, and advanced statistical data.

2.  **Knowledge Graph Integration:**
    *   **Knowledge Graph Source:** Utilize a pre-trained knowledge graph (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) or build a domain-specific knowledge graph.
    *   **Entity Linking:**  Identify entities within the input text and link them to corresponding nodes in the knowledge graph.
    *   **Contextual Enrichment:**  Retrieve relevant relationships and attributes from the knowledge graph for each identified entity.
    *   **Explanation Augmentation:**  Incorporate these contextual details into the explanation. For example, if a token relates to "apple," the explanation could include information about the company, the fruit, or related concepts.

3.  **Dynamic Visualization:**
    *   **Interactive Node-Link Diagram:** Create a visualization that displays the relationships between tokens, entities, and concepts.  Nodes represent tokens/entities, and links represent their relationships.
    *   **Granularity Control:** Allow users to zoom in/out and filter the visualization to control the level of detail.
    *   **Color-Coding:** Use color-coding to highlight the strength of the prediction influence scores.
    *   **Concept Expansion:** Allow users to click on a node to expand its representation with additional information from the knowledge graph.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateExplanation(text, prediction, cognitiveLoad, userGranularityPreference):
    tokenGroups = identifyTokenGroups(text)
    influenceScores = calculateInfluenceScores(tokenGroups, prediction)

    if cognitiveLoad > thresholdHigh:
        granularity = "high"
        selectedTokenGroups = aggregateTokenGroups(tokenGroups) //Simplified groupings
    else if cognitiveLoad < thresholdLow:
        granularity = "detailed"
        selectedTokenGroups = tokenGroups
    else:
        granularity = userGranularityPreference
        selectedTokenGroups = adjustGranularity(tokenGroups, granularity)

    knowledgeGraph = loadKnowledgeGraph()
    enrichedTokenGroups = enrichWithKnowledgeGraph(selectedTokenGroups, knowledgeGraph)

    visualization = createInteractiveVisualization(enrichedTokenGroups, influenceScores)
    return visualization
```

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond simply providing influence scores for tokens. It dynamically tailors the explanation to the *user’s* current cognitive state and enriches the explanation with external knowledge, resulting in a more intuitive and informative experience.  Existing systems primarily focus on static presentation of influence scores and lack the adaptive and contextual awareness.
