## Dynamic Function Composition via Learned Execution Graphs

**Concept:** Extend the multi-tenant serverless execution model to allow for dynamic composition of serverless functions *during* runtime, based on learned execution graphs. This allows for adaptive and personalized serverless workflows without pre-defined orchestration.

**Specifications:**

**I. Graph Learning Component:**

*   **Input:** Historical invocation data of serverless functions (function ID, sub-tenant ID, input parameters, execution time, return values).
*   **Model:** A Graph Neural Network (GNN) trained to predict optimal execution paths (sequences of functions) given an input request and sub-tenant context. The GNNâ€™s nodes represent serverless functions, and edges represent potential execution flow. Edge weights represent predicted performance (latency, cost) or probability of success.
*   **Training:** Continuous online learning. The GNN updates its weights based on real-time execution data, adapting to changing workloads and user behavior.
*   **Output:** A ranked list of potential execution graphs for a given request, along with confidence scores.

**II. Runtime Execution Engine:**

*   **Invocation Request Handling:** Receives a call to execute a serverless function, including function ID and sub-tenant ID.
*   **Graph Retrieval:** Queries the Graph Learning Component for the top-N ranked execution graphs for the given request and sub-tenant.
*   **A/B Testing & Exploration:** Implements an exploration/exploitation strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy, Thompson sampling) to test different execution graphs in production. This allows for continuous refinement of the GNN model and discovery of more efficient workflows.
*   **Dynamic Function Invocation:** Based on the selected execution graph, dynamically invokes the necessary serverless functions in the correct sequence.
*   **State Management:** Provides a mechanism for passing state between functions in the execution graph (e.g., using a lightweight key-value store).

**III. Sub-Tenant Customization:**

*   **Personalized Graphs:** The GNN model is trained *separately* for each sub-tenant, allowing for personalized execution graphs tailored to their specific needs and usage patterns.
*   **Sub-Tenant Policies:** Enables administrators to define policies that constrain the possible execution graphs for a given sub-tenant (e.g., to enforce security or compliance requirements).
*   **Feedback Loop:** Captures user feedback (e.g., ratings, explicit preferences) and incorporates it into the GNN training process.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Upon receiving an invocation request:
function handleInvocation(functionId, subTenantId, inputParams) {
  // Retrieve top-N execution graphs from the Graph Learning Component
  executionGraphs = graphLearningComponent.getExecutionGraphs(functionId, subTenantId, inputParams);

  // Select an execution graph based on exploration/exploitation strategy
  selectedGraph = selectGraph(executionGraphs);

  // Execute the functions in the selected graph
  result = executeGraph(selectedGraph, inputParams);

  return result;
}

function executeGraph(graph, inputParams) {
  currentParams = inputParams;
  for (functionNode in graph) {
    response = invokeServerlessFunction(functionNode.functionId, currentParams);
    currentParams = response; // Pass response as input to next function
  }
  return currentParams;
}
```

**Infrastructure Requirements:**

*   Distributed graph database to store the GNN model and execution graphs.
*   High-throughput message queue for handling invocation requests.
*   Scalable serverless function execution environment.
*   Monitoring and alerting system for tracking performance and errors.
