## Adaptive Resonance Drone Swarm

**Concept:** A drone swarm utilizing capacitive proximity sensing not for *avoidance* but for *coordinated environmental mapping and resonant interaction*. Instead of avoiding obstacles, the drones intentionally approach and “feel” their surroundings, building a dynamic, high-resolution map based on capacitance changes, and leveraging those changes for collective behavior.

**Specifications:**

*   **Drone Unit:**
    *   Dimensions: 15cm diameter, 8cm height.
    *   Weight: 300g.
    *   Propulsion: Quadcopter configuration with shrouded propellers.
    *   Power: Solid-state battery, 30-minute flight time.
    *   Processing: Onboard System-on-Chip (SoC) with dedicated neural network accelerator.
    *   Communication: Mesh networking via 60GHz millimeter wave radio.
*   **Capacitive Sensing Array:**
    *   Integrated into the shroud surrounding each propeller.
    *   High-density array of capacitive sensors (minimum 256 sensors per drone).
    *   Sensor range: 5cm - 20cm.
    *   Data Resolution: 12-bit.
    *   Sampling Rate: 100Hz.
*   **Software & Algorithms:**
    *   **Resonance Mapping:**
        1.  Each drone continuously scans its environment using the capacitive array.
        2.  Raw capacitance data is processed to generate a localized "capacitance map."
        3.  Maps are shared with neighboring drones via mesh network.
        4.  A collective "environmental resonance map" is constructed. The map doesn't just represent *location* of objects, but their dielectric properties (material composition) as inferred from capacitance.
    *   **Collective Behavior – "Harmonic Swarming":**
        1.  Drones respond to changes in the environmental resonance map in a coordinated manner.
        2.  Algorithm: Each drone calculates a “harmonic vector” based on the capacitance gradient around it. This vector indicates the direction and magnitude of the strongest capacitive signal.
        3.  Drones adjust their position to align their harmonic vectors, creating a self-organizing swarm that "flows" around and through the environment.
        4.  The swarm's collective movement creates a 'wave' of capacitive readings, enhancing the overall map resolution.
    *   **Dynamic Reconfiguration:**
        1.  If a drone encounters a strong or unusual capacitive signature, it broadcasts a signal to the swarm.
        2.  Other drones reconfigure their scanning patterns to focus on that area.
        3.  This allows the swarm to dynamically adapt to changing environmental conditions or locate specific objects.
*   **Applications:**
    *   **Search & Rescue:** Locate individuals trapped in collapsed buildings or debris fields.
    *   **Environmental Monitoring:** Map underground water sources or detect hidden pollution.
    *   **Precision Agriculture:** Analyze soil composition and plant health.
    *   **Artistic Installations:** Create interactive light and sound displays based on environmental changes.

**Pseudocode (Harmonic Vector Calculation):**

```
// Input: Capacitance map (2D array of capacitance values)
// Output: Harmonic vector (x, y)

function calculateHarmonicVector(capacitanceMap) {
  let x = 0;
  let y = 0;
  let magnitude = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < capacitanceMap.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < capacitanceMap[i].length; j++) {
      let capacitance = capacitanceMap[i][j];
      let weight = capacitance; // Higher capacitance = higher weight

      x += weight * j;
      y += weight * i;
      magnitude += weight;
    }
  }

  if (magnitude > 0) {
    x /= magnitude;
    y /= magnitude;
  }

  return (x, y);
}
```
