## Networked Device Charger - Environmental Data Hub

**Concept:** Expand the charger’s functionality beyond data transfer and power to include localized environmental data collection and reporting, creating a micro-climate monitoring network.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Components:**
    *   Existing: Processor, WiFi Antenna, Power Connector, Data/Charging Connector.
    *   Added: Miniature Environmental Sensor Suite (Temperature, Humidity, Air Quality – PM2.5, VOCs, CO2), Real-Time Clock (RTC), Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) radio (LoRaWAN or similar).
*   **Data Acquisition:**
    *   Sensor Suite continuously monitors ambient conditions.
    *   Data timestamped by RTC.
    *   Data stored locally in non-volatile memory.
*   **Data Transmission:**
    *   Primary: WiFi connection to cloud server for high-bandwidth data transfer (detailed sensor logs).
    *   Secondary: LPWAN radio for backup data transmission and broader network coverage (in case WiFi is unavailable).
    *   Data transmission triggered by:
        *   Scheduled intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes).
        *   Significant environmental change (threshold exceeded – e.g., high CO2 levels).
        *   Device disconnect/reconnect – “opportunistic” data upload.
*   **User Interaction (via connected device):**
    *   App displays localized environmental data (temperature, humidity, air quality).
    *   User configurable alerts (e.g., notify if temperature exceeds a threshold).
    *   Data logging and historical trends visualization.
*   **Power Management:**
    *   Low-power sleep mode when not actively charging or transmitting.
    *   Battery backup for RTC and limited sensor operation during power outages.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Embedded OS (e.g., FreeRTOS or similar)
    *   WiFi stack
    *   LPWAN stack
    *   Sensor data acquisition and processing routines.
    *   Data formatting and transmission protocols.
    *   Over-the-air (OTA) firmware update capability.

**Pseudocode (Data Transmission Logic):**

```
loop:
    if (device_connected):
        read_sensor_data()
        if (significant_change or time_interval_elapsed):
            format_data()
            transmit_data_via_wifi()
            log_data_locally()

    else:
        // WiFi unavailable.
        if (time_interval_elapsed_lpwan):
          format_data_lpwan() //reduced data set
          transmit_data_via_lpwan()
          log_data_locally()

    sleep(1 second)
end loop
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Smart Home/Building Automation
*   Indoor Air Quality Monitoring
*   Environmental Research
*   Precision Agriculture (localized microclimate data)
*   Disaster Response (real-time environmental data in affected areas)
