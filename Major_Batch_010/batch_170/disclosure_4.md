## Temporal Distance Mapping with Multi-Modal Fusion

**System Overview:**

A system to generate a "distance map" not just of spatial arrangement within a *single* image, but across a short video clip, fusing visual data with audio cues to infer social distancing compliance and emotional state. This builds on the attention mechanisms described in the patent, extending them to the temporal dimension and incorporating non-visual data.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Video Intake & Patching:**  Standard video input. Frame extraction at a configurable rate (e.g., 5 FPS). Each frame is divided into patches as in the source patent.

2.  **Audio Intake & Feature Extraction:**  Simultaneous audio recording.  Feature extraction focuses on:
    *   Speech presence/absence
    *   Speech volume/intensity
    *   Detected emotional tone (anger, distress, neutrality – using pre-trained models).
    *   Proximity estimation - If multiple speakers, directionality and estimated distance between sources.

3.  **Multi-Modal Feature Vectors:**
    *   For each patch *and* each frame, generate a visual feature vector (as in the patent – processed through attention mechanisms).
    *   Associate an audio feature vector with each frame, representing the *global* audio characteristics. This global vector is then replicated/associated with *all* patches within that frame.
    *   Concatenate the visual and audio feature vectors for each patch/frame to create a unified feature vector.

4.  **Temporal Attention Mechanism:** This is the key innovation.  Instead of just attending to other patches within a *single* frame, the system attends to:
    *   The *same* patch in *previous* frames (creating a “motion history” for that location).
    *   Nearby patches in *previous* frames (inferring object movement).
    *   The *global* audio feature vector of *previous* frames (linking audio events to specific locations).

    Pseudocode:

    ```
    For each patch 'p' in frame 'f':
        # Visual Attention (as in patent)
        visual_attention = apply_visual_attention(p, other_patches_in_f)

        # Temporal Attention
        temporal_attention = 0
        For i in range(1, history_length + 1):
            past_frame = f - i
            # Attend to same patch in past frame
            past_patch = get_patch(past_frame, p.location)
            temporal_attention += softmax(query(p) * key(past_patch)) * value(past_patch)

            # Attend to nearby patches in past frame
            nearby_patches = get_nearby_patches(past_frame, p.location)
            For np in nearby_patches:
                temporal_attention += softmax(query(p) * key(np)) * value(np)

            # Attend to global audio from past frames
            audio_vector = get_global_audio_vector(past_frame)
            temporal_attention += softmax(query(p) * key(audio_vector)) * value(audio_vector)

        # Combine attentions
        combined_attention = (0.7 * visual_attention) + (0.3 * temporal_attention)

        # Transform feature vector using combined attention
        transformed_feature_vector = apply_attention(p.feature_vector, combined_attention)
    ```

5.  **Distance Map Generation:** The transformed feature vectors are fed into a classification network (similar to the patent’s classifier) to generate a "distance score" for each patch. These scores are then aggregated to create a "distance map" for the entire frame – a heatmap visually representing areas of potential distancing violations.

6.  **Behavioral Inference:** The system goes beyond simply detecting distance. Based on the distance map and audio analysis, it infers behavioral states:
    *   **Approach/Avoidance:**  Are people consistently moving closer or further apart?
    *   **Engagement Level:** Is there prolonged close proximity combined with high audio volume (indicating conversation)?
    *   **Stress/Anxiety:** Is there erratic movement combined with distressed audio cues?

**Output:**

*   Real-time distance map overlay on video feed.
*   Behavioral state indicators (e.g., “Low Engagement”, “Potential Violation”, “Elevated Stress”).
*   Event logging and analysis (e.g., frequency of violations, peak stress times).
