## Dynamic Relation Weighting for Query Confidence

**Concept:** The patent focuses on identifying relations between entities. However, the confidence in those relations isn't dynamically adjusted based on the *source* of the information or the *context* of the query. This design introduces a system to weight relations based on source reliability and query-specific relevance, dramatically improving answer accuracy and user trust.

**Specs:**

1.  **Source Reliability Database:**
    *   Data Structure: Graph database. Nodes represent information sources (websites, documents, APIs, internal knowledge bases). Edges represent trust relationships (e.g., "cited by," "verified by," "contradicted by").
    *   Metrics: Each source node stores:
        *   *Overall Reliability Score:* A value between 0-1, initially assigned based on a pre-defined heuristic (e.g., Wikipedia = 0.8, random blog = 0.2).
        *   *Relation-Specific Reliability:*  A dictionary mapping relations (e.g., “born_in”, “works_at”) to a score.  This allows a source to be reliable for some relations but not others.  Updated based on fact-checking and user feedback (see 3).
        *   *Last Updated:* Timestamp of last reliability assessment.
2.  **Query Context Analyzer:**
    *   Input: User query text.
    *   Output:  A list of "contextual keywords" and a "query intent" classification.
    *   Process:  Utilizes a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., BERT) to identify keywords indicating the query’s focus (e.g., "recent events," "historical accuracy," "casual information").  The model classifies the query's intent (e.g., "fact-seeking," "opinion-seeking," "entertainment").
3.  **Dynamic Relation Weighting Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Identified entities, relations, source reliability scores, query context.
    *   Process:
        *   For each relation between entities:
            *   Retrieve the source reliability score for that relation.
            *   Apply a *contextual weight* based on the query intent:
                *   If intent is "fact-seeking":  High weight to sources with high reliability.
                *   If intent is "opinion-seeking":  Equal weight to all sources (allowing diverse perspectives).
                *   If intent is "entertainment": Lowest weight to all sources (prioritizing engaging content).
            *   Calculate a *weighted relation score* =  `Source Reliability * Contextual Weight`.
    *   Output: A ranked list of relation facts, sorted by weighted relation score.
4.  **User Feedback Loop:**
    *   Mechanism:  Users can "upvote" or "downvote" answers.
    *   Process:  Downvotes trigger a review of the source and relation, potentially decreasing the source's reliability score and relation-specific reliability.  Upvotes increase confidence.
5.  **System Architecture:**
    *   Modular design: Separate components for Source Reliability Database, Query Context Analyzer, Dynamic Relation Weighting Algorithm, and User Feedback Loop.
    *   API endpoints: Expose functionality for querying and updating source reliability scores.
    *   Scalability: Utilize distributed database and caching mechanisms to handle large volumes of data and requests.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Relation Weighting Algorithm):**

```
function calculate_weighted_relation_score(entity1, entity2, relation, source, query_intent):
  source_reliability = get_source_reliability(source, relation)
  
  if query_intent == "fact-seeking":
    contextual_weight = 0.8
  elif query_intent == "opinion-seeking":
    contextual_weight = 0.2
  else: #entertainment
    contextual_weight = 0.1
    
  weighted_score = source_reliability * contextual_weight
  return weighted_score

# Example usage
entity1 = "Barack Obama"
entity2 = "United States"
relation = "president_of"
source = "Wikipedia"
query_intent = "fact-seeking"

score = calculate_weighted_relation_score(entity1, entity2, relation, source, query_intent)
print(score)
```
