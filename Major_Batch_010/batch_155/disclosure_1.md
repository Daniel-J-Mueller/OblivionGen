## Temporal Graph Embedding with Predictive Anchoring

**Concept:** Extend the cluster tracking concept to create dynamic, predictive embeddings of the network graph itself, leveraging anchor nodes not just for ID propagation, but for predicting future cluster evolution. This moves beyond simply *tracking* incidents to *anticipating* them.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Input:**

*   Real-time stream of network alerts/events (as in the patent).
*   Network topology data – a graph representation of network devices and their connections.
*   Historical network event data (at least several days/weeks worth) – timestamps, event types, device IDs.

**2. Core Algorithm - Temporal Graph Embedding (TGE):**

*   **Initial Embedding:** Create an initial embedding of the network graph using a graph embedding technique (Node2Vec, GraphSAGE, etc.).  Each node (network device) gets a vector representation capturing its role in the network topology.
*   **Event-Driven Embedding Update:**
    *   When alerts arrive, create a temporary 'event graph' where nodes are devices involved in the alerts and edges represent relationships within the event.
    *   Combine the event graph with the existing network graph using a weighted averaging or concatenation approach. This creates a 'current state graph embedding'.
*   **Anchor Node Weighting:** Identify anchor nodes as per the patent.  Crucially, *increase* the weight of anchor nodes *within the current state graph embedding*.  The more frequently a node acts as an anchor (across multiple time steps), the higher its weight. This focuses the embedding on nodes which act as consistent connection points.
*   **Temporal Decay:** Implement a temporal decay factor on previous embeddings. Embeddings from earlier time steps contribute less to the current embedding. This allows the model to adapt to evolving network conditions.
*   **Predictive Step:**  Use a recurrent neural network (RNN – LSTM or GRU) trained on the *sequence of graph embeddings*. The RNN attempts to *predict* the next graph embedding in the sequence. The difference between the predicted embedding and the actual embedding represents an "anomaly score" or indicates potential future issues.

**3. Predictive Anchoring:**

*   **Anchor Node Influence Map:** Analyze the predictive model's output. Identify which anchor nodes have the *greatest influence* on the prediction accuracy.  Nodes where changes in their embedding significantly impact the model's output are considered critical for future cluster evolution.
*   **Future Cluster Prediction:**  Based on the influence map, predict potential future cluster formations. If the model predicts that two currently disjoint clusters are likely to merge (based on changes in anchor node embeddings), proactively alert administrators.
*   **Adaptive Weighting:**  Adjust the weights of anchor nodes in the embedding based on their predictive power.  Nodes which consistently contribute to accurate predictions receive higher weights.

**4. System Components:**

*   **Real-time Event Ingestion Service:** Handles the stream of network alerts.
*   **Graph Database:** Stores the network topology and historical event data.
*   **Embedding Engine:**  Implements the TGE algorithm and RNN training.
*   **Prediction Service:**  Handles real-time prediction and anomaly detection.
*   **Alerting System:**  Notifies administrators of potential issues or predicted cluster changes.

**Pseudocode (Embedding Update):**

```
function update_embedding(current_graph, event_graph, anchor_nodes, previous_embedding, time_decay):
    # Combine graphs (weighted averaging)
    combined_graph = (current_graph * (1 - event_weight)) + (event_graph * event_weight)

    # Increase anchor node weights
    for node in anchor_nodes:
        combined_graph[node] = combined_graph[node] * anchor_weight_multiplier

    # Apply temporal decay
    new_embedding = (combined_graph * (1 - time_decay)) + (previous_embedding * time_decay)

    return new_embedding
```

**Novelty:**

This system goes beyond simply tracking clusters to actively *predicting* future network behavior. By leveraging anchor nodes as focal points for graph embedding and predictive modeling, it enables proactive identification of potential issues before they impact the network. The adaptive weighting scheme ensures that the model continuously learns and improves its predictive accuracy.
