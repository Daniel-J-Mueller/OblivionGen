## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Composition

**Concept:** This builds upon the idea of contextual awareness in the provided patent, but instead of simply *selecting* different acoustic models based on location and objects, it dynamically *composes* a unique acoustic model in real-time by blending weighted contributions from a library of pre-trained “acoustic primitives.” This allows for far more nuanced and accurate speech processing than simply switching between discrete models.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Acoustic Primitive Library:**
    *   A database containing a set of pre-trained acoustic models. Each model is specialized for a specific acoustic “primitive” – e.g., “open office chatter”, “car interior noise”, “kitchen appliance hum”, “echo from tiled surface”, “reverberation profile of a large hall”, “street noise”, “background music (genre-specific)”.
    *   Primitives are trained on large datasets of isolated sound events *and* representative environmental recordings. Crucially, primitives are designed to be *additive* – meaning their outputs can be meaningfully combined.
    *   Primitives are represented as parameterized models – e.g., using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) or Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with learnable weights and biases.

2.  **Real-time Scene Analysis Module:**
    *   Utilizes the microphone array data *and* visual input (from a camera, if available) to estimate the acoustic composition of the current environment.
    *   Employs a combination of techniques:
        *   **Source Localization:** Using the microphone array to identify and localize sound sources (speech, noise, etc.).
        *   **Sound Event Detection (SED):** Identifying specific sound events (e.g., “keyboard typing,” “door slam,” “siren”).
        *   **Material Recognition (Visual):** Analyzing the visual scene to identify materials and surfaces that contribute to acoustics (e.g., “carpet,” “glass,” “concrete”).
        *   **Environmental Context:**  Leveraging location data, time of day, and other contextual information.
    *   Outputs a "scene composition vector" – a numerical representation of the acoustic environment, with each element corresponding to the estimated contribution of a specific acoustic primitive.  Example: `[0.7 (open office), 0.2 (keyboard), 0.1 (HVAC)]`.

3.  **Dynamic Model Composer:**
    *   Takes the scene composition vector as input.
    *   Dynamically blends the weighted contributions of the relevant acoustic primitives to create a customized acoustic model.
    *   Blending can be implemented using:
        *   **Weighted Sum:**  A simple linear combination of the primitives' output probabilities.
        *   **Gating Networks:**  DNNs that learn to dynamically adjust the weights of each primitive based on the input audio features.
        *   **Mixture of Experts:**  A more sophisticated approach where different “expert” models (acoustic primitives) specialize in different aspects of the acoustic scene.
    *   Outputs the customized acoustic model, which is then used for speech recognition, noise cancellation, or other audio processing tasks.

4.  **Adaptive Learning & Refinement:**
    *   Continuously monitors the performance of the customized acoustic model.
    *   Utilizes reinforcement learning to adjust the weights of the acoustic primitives and refine the blending strategy.
    *   Can incorporate user feedback (e.g., manual adjustments, error corrections) to further improve accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Model Composer):**

```
function compose_acoustic_model(scene_composition_vector, audio_features):
  // scene_composition_vector: [weight_1, weight_2, ..., weight_N]
  // audio_features:  Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), etc.

  acoustic_model = empty_model()

  for i in range(N):
    primitive = load_acoustic_primitive(i)
    output = primitive.process(audio_features)
    weighted_output = output * scene_composition_vector[i]
    acoustic_model.add(weighted_output)

  return acoustic_model
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced speech recognition in challenging acoustic environments.
*   Improved noise cancellation and suppression.
*   Personalized audio experiences tailored to the user’s location and activities.
*   More accurate sound event detection and classification.
