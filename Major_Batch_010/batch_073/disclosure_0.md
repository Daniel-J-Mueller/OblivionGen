## Proactive Environmental Adjustment System

**Concept:** Leveraging fall detection & contextual awareness to *prevent* falls via subtle environmental adjustments. This expands beyond reacting *to* a fall to proactively mitigating risk.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Integration with existing fall detection system (as per provided patent).
    *   Networked “smart” environmental controls: lighting, localized floor surface adjustability (small actuators to adjust angle/texture), micro-climate control (localized temperature/humidity).
    *   High-resolution depth sensors (beyond camera for fall detection) to map environment & detect subtle gait instability *before* a fall.
    *   Wearable sensor package (watch/band) incorporating gyroscope, accelerometer, and potentially bio-impedance sensors to assess hydration/fatigue levels.

*   **Software/Logic:**

    1.  **Baseline Establishment:** Upon system initialization/user profile creation, establish a baseline of normal gait & movement patterns using wearable & depth sensor data. Record environmental preferences (lighting, temperature).
    2.  **Risk Assessment:**  Continuous monitoring of user gait (wearable + depth sensors). Algorithm detects deviations from baseline indicative of increased fall risk. Factors include:
        *   Reduced stride length/velocity
        *   Increased gait variability
        *   Postural instability (sway, lean)
        *   Hydration/fatigue levels (from wearable bio-impedance/activity data)
        *   Environmental factors (low light, slippery surfaces - detected via depth/visual data)
    3.  **Proactive Adjustment:**  Based on risk assessment, system automatically adjusts environment:
        *   **Lighting:** Increase illumination in areas with detected risk. Adjust color temperature to improve visibility.
        *   **Surface Adjustment:**  Minor floor angle adjustments to subtly improve stability.  Localized texture changes to increase friction (using micro-actuators).  Example: Slightly raise the leading edge of a step, or briefly activate a high-friction surface patch.
        *   **Micro-Climate Control:** Adjust temperature/humidity to improve grip/comfort (e.g., reduce condensation on floors).
        *   **Haptic Feedback:** Subtle vibrations in the wearable device to alert the user to potential instability *before* a visible stumble. (Can be customized.)
    4.  **Event Logging & Learning:** Log all adjustments & user responses. Machine learning algorithm refines risk assessment & adjustment strategies over time, personalizing the system to each user.
    5.  **Fall Detection Override:** If a fall *does* occur, revert to standard fall detection protocol (as per provided patent).

*   **Pseudocode (Risk Assessment/Adjustment):**

    ```
    while (systemActive) {
      gaitData = getGaitData(wearableSensor, depthSensor);
      riskScore = calculateRiskScore(gaitData, userBaseline);

      if (riskScore > threshold) {
        adjustmentNeeded = true;

        if (lowLightDetected()) {
          increaseLighting();
        }

        if (slipperySurfaceDetected()) {
          adjustFloorTexture();
        }

        if (hydrationLow() || fatigueHigh()) {
          displayHydrationAlert();
        }
      }
    }
    ```

*   **Potential Expansion:** Integration with smart home voice assistants for verbal alerts ("Slightly unstable. Increasing lighting.") or confirmation of adjustments ("Adjusting floor texture for improved grip.").
