## Adaptive Interference Cancellation via Predictive Frame Aggregation

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust frame aggregation counts *not only* based on bandwidth/throughput needs, but also to proactively cancel interference from other wireless devices. This builds on the existing concept of frame aggregation, but leverages it as a tool for interference management, rather than purely data efficiency.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing WiFi/Bluetooth transceiver capable of frame aggregation.
    *   Dedicated, low-power DSP or FPGA for real-time signal processing.
    *   Directional antenna array (optional, but significantly improves performance).
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Interference Prediction Module:** This module analyzes the RF environment to predict interference sources. This could involve:
        *   Scanning for nearby WiFi/Bluetooth signals.
        *   Monitoring channel utilization.
        *   Learning patterns of interference (e.g., a microwave oven turning on at a specific time).
        *   Utilizing a database of known interferers and their characteristics.
    *   **Adaptive Frame Aggregation Controller:** This module controls the frame aggregation count based on:
        *   Data throughput requirements.
        *   Interference prediction data.
        *   Channel conditions.
    *   **Phase Shifting Algorithm:** The core innovation. This algorithm manipulates the phase of the transmitted signal within each aggregated frame. The goal is to create destructive interference at the location of the interfering device(s), while constructively interfering at the intended receiver. This is executed in the DSP/FPGA.
    *   **Feedback Loop:**  A system for measuring the effectiveness of the interference cancellation. This could involve:
        *   Monitoring the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at the receiver.
        *   Measuring the packet error rate (PER).
        *   Adjusting the phase shifting algorithm based on feedback.
*   **Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

    ```
    // Initialize:
    scan_environment()
    establish_baseline_interference_profile()

    // Main Loop:
    while (true) {
      // 1. Predict Interference:
      predicted_interference = predict_interference(current_time, environment_profile)

      // 2. Calculate Optimal Frame Aggregation Count:
      desired_throughput = calculate_desired_throughput()
      optimal_aggregation_count = calculate_optimal_aggregation_count(desired_throughput, predicted_interference)

      // 3. Phase Shifting Calculation:
      phase_shifts = calculate_phase_shifts(predicted_interference_sources, device_location, receiver_location)

      // 4. Frame Aggregation & Phase Application:
      aggregated_frame = create_aggregated_frame(data_packets, phase_shifts)

      // 5. Transmit Frame:
      transmit_frame(aggregated_frame)

      // 6. Monitor Feedback:
      sir = measure_sir()
      per = measure_per()

      // 7. Adaptive Adjustment:
      if (sir < threshold || per > threshold) {
        adjust_phase_shifting_algorithm(sir, per)
        adjust_aggregation_count(sir, per)
      }
    }
    ```

**Operation:**

The system continuously scans the RF environment, predicts potential interference, and adjusts the frame aggregation count and phase shifting algorithm accordingly. By strategically manipulating the phase of the transmitted signal, the system can create destructive interference at the source of the interference, thereby improving the signal-to-interference ratio at the intended receiver.

**Novelty:**

The existing patent focuses on optimizing frame aggregation for throughput. This concept adds an entirely new dimension â€“ using frame aggregation as a tool for *active interference cancellation*. It moves beyond simply adapting to the environment to actively shaping it.  The phase shifting within the aggregated frames is the key innovation. This isn't just about transmitting more data; it's about intelligently managing the RF spectrum.
