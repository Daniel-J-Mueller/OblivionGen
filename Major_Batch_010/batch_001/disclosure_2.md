## Dynamic Feature Flags via Learned Request Profiles

**System Specification:**

**Core Components:**

1.  **Request Profile Learner (RPL):** A machine learning model residing within the request router.  Responsible for constructing and maintaining a multi-dimensional profile of incoming requests. Dimensions include:
    *   User Agent String (hashed for privacy).
    *   Geographic Location (derived from IP address, coarse-grained).
    *   Request Type (GET, POST, etc.).
    *   Endpoint Accessed.
    *   Request Payload Size (approximate).
    *   Time of Day (binned).
2.  **Feature Flag Repository (FFR):**  A database storing feature flag definitions and associated request profile ranges.  Each flag entry includes:
    *   Flag Name
    *   Flag Value (true/false)
    *   Request Profile Range Definition (see below)
3.  **Real-time Profile Matcher (RPM):**  A component within the request router that receives incoming requests, extracts relevant features, and matches them against the ranges defined in the FFR.
4.  **Dynamic Routing Controller (DRC):** A component within the request router. Upon a successful match of a request profile to a feature flag, the DRC alters routing logic.

**Request Profile Range Definition:**

Ranges are defined using a combination of continuous and categorical features. For continuous features (e.g., payload size), define minimum and maximum values. For categorical features (e.g. user agent string), define a set of allowed values, or ranges based on similarity. These ranges are stored as nested JSON structures within the FFR.  Similarity is determined by pre-computed embeddings of user agent strings, and nearest-neighbor lookup.

**Data Flow:**

1.  Incoming request arrives at the request router.
2.  RPM extracts request features.
3.  RPM compares extracted features against ranges defined in FFR. The comparison uses weighted scoring to handle incomplete matches.
4.  If a match is found with a score above a defined threshold:
    *   DRC alters routing logic to send the request to a specific backend node, or apply a specific backend transformation.
    *   DRC dynamically configures the backend to modify its behavior based on the feature flag.
5.  If no match is found, routing proceeds as normal (using the default routing policy).
6.  RPL continuously learns from incoming requests. It refines request profiles and suggests new ranges for the FFR. This is done through anomaly detection and clustering of incoming requests. The RPL uses unsupervised learning to identify distinct request patterns. It proposes new ranges that capture these patterns.

**Pseudocode (RPL â€“ Update FFR):**

```
function update_ffr(request_features):
  // 1. Anomaly Detection
  anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(request_features)
  if anomaly_score > threshold:
    // 2. Clustering
    cluster_id = cluster_request(request_features)
    // 3. Range Proposal
    new_range = create_range_from_cluster(cluster_id)
    // 4. FFR Update (Asynchronous)
    update_ffr_database(new_range)
    log("New range proposed for feature flag: ", new_range)
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The FFR can be implemented using a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) for scalability and flexibility.
*   The RPL can be implemented using a distributed machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   The RPM can be optimized using caching and indexing techniques.
*   Privacy considerations:  Hash sensitive data (e.g., user agent strings) before storing them. Use coarse-grained location data.

**Benefits:**

*   **Granular Control:** Enable feature flags for specific user segments based on their request characteristics.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:** Adapt backend behavior in real-time without requiring code deployments.
*   **Personalization:** Deliver personalized experiences to users based on their request profiles.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Run A/B tests with finer granularity and more targeted user segments.
*   **Increased Flexibility:** Adapt to changing user behavior and market conditions more quickly.
