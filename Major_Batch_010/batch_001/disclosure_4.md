## Modular, Reconfigurable Bin Interiors – Dynamic Flow Control

**Concept:** Develop bin interiors comprised of individually controllable, miniature conveyor sections embedded within the bin floor. These sections would dynamically adjust to direct items towards the outlet, optimize space utilization, and even sort items *within* the bin itself.

**Specs:**

*   **Bin Floor Construction:** Replace standard bin floors with a matrix of hexagonal or square ‘flow tiles’. Each tile is approximately 2”x2”x0.5”, constructed of a durable, low-friction polymer.
*   **Tile Actuation:** Each tile contains a miniature linear actuator (piezoelectric or micro-servo) capable of tilting the tile up to 15 degrees in any direction. Actuation is individually controlled by an embedded microcontroller.
*   **Power & Communication:** Tiles are powered by thin-film conductors embedded within the bin floor and communicate via a mesh network (Bluetooth Low Energy or similar) to a central bin controller.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Each tile incorporates a small weight sensor to detect the presence and weight of items. Data from weight sensors combined with tile position informs the flow control algorithm.
*   **Control Algorithm:**  Algorithm prioritizes directing items towards the outlet endwall based on real-time weight distribution and item detection. Dynamic pathing is calculated to minimize friction and collisions.
*   **Reconfiguration Modes:**
    *   **Flow Mode:** Standard operation, directing all items to the outlet.
    *   **Space Optimization Mode:** Algorithm prioritizes compacting items within the bin, minimizing wasted space.
    *   **Pre-Sort Mode:**  Algorithm can be programmed to divert items based on weight or sensed characteristics (requires additional sensors – see below).
*   **Optional Sensor Modules:**
    *   **RFID Scanner Module:** Integrated into select tiles to identify specific items and direct them to dedicated outlet zones.
    *   **Optical Scanner Module:**  Can identify item dimensions or color for more advanced pre-sorting.

**Pseudocode (Flow Control Algorithm):**

```
// Define bin dimensions and tile matrix
INT binWidth, binLength, tileRows, tileCols

// Initialize tile positions to flat (0 degree tilt)
FOR row = 0 TO tileRows
    FOR col = 0 TO tileCols
        tile[row, col].tilt = 0
    END FOR
END FOR

// Main loop
WHILE (true)
    // Sense item positions and weights
    FOR row = 0 TO tileRows
        FOR col = 0 TO tileCols
            IF (tile[row, col].weight > threshold)
                itemPresent[row, col] = TRUE
            ELSE
                itemPresent[row, col] = FALSE
            END IF
        END FOR
    END FOR

    // Calculate optimal tilt for each tile
    FOR row = 0 TO tileRows
        FOR col = 0 TO tileCols
            IF (itemPresent[row, col])
                // Calculate angle to direct item towards outlet
                angle = calculateAngle(row, col, outletX, outletY)
                tile[row, col].tilt = angle
            ELSE
                tile[row, col].tilt = 0
            END IF
        END FOR
    END FOR

    // Apply tilt to tiles
    FOR row = 0 TO tileRows
        FOR col = 0 TO tileCols
            setTileTilt(row, col, tile[row, col].tilt)
        END FOR
    END FOR

    // Wait for next cycle
    delay(100ms)
END WHILE
```
