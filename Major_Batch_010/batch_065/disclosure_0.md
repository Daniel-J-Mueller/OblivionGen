## Event-Driven Data Weaving with Temporal Context

**Specification:** A system to dynamically construct event data payloads based on historical event context, allowing downstream services to react to events not just as they *are*, but as they *have been*.

**Core Concept:** Extending the pipe concept to include a 'temporal weaving' layer. This layer intercepts event data flowing through the pipe and dynamically augments it with contextual data derived from a time-series database representing historical event data.

**Components:**

1.  **Event Interceptor:** Sits at the beginning of the pipe, capturing event data.
2.  **Contextual Data Retriever:** Queries a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) based on the event's initiating resource and a configurable temporal window (e.g., last 5 minutes, last hour, last day).
3.  **Data Weaver:** Merges the retrieved historical data with the original event data, creating an enriched event payload.  Rules define how historical data is integrated (e.g., average value over the window, most recent value, statistical distribution).
4.  **Augmented Pipe:** Transmits the enriched event payload to the destination service.
5.  **Configuration Interface:** Allows users to define temporal windows, integration rules, and relevant historical data points for specific event types.

**Pseudocode (Data Weaver):**

```
function weave_data(event_data, historical_data, integration_rule):
  enriched_data = event_data.copy()

  if integration_rule == "average":
    for key, value in historical_data.items():
      enriched_data[key] = average(value)
  elif integration_rule == "most_recent":
    for key, value in historical_data.items():
      enriched_data[key] = value[-1] # Assuming historical_data is a time series
  elif integration_rule == "statistical_distribution":
    # Calculate mean, standard deviation, percentiles, etc.
    # Add these to enriched_data
  else:
    # Default: add raw historical data (potentially large)
    enriched_data["historical_data"] = historical_data

  return enriched_data
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Event occurs.
2.  Event Interceptor captures event data.
3.  Contextual Data Retriever queries time-series database based on event type and defined window.
4.  Data Weaver merges historical data with event data according to configured rules.
5.  Augmented Pipe transmits enriched event data to destination service.

**Use Cases:**

*   **Fraud Detection:** Enrich transaction events with historical spending patterns to identify anomalous activity.
*   **Predictive Maintenance:** Combine sensor data with historical failure rates to predict equipment malfunctions.
*   **Personalized Recommendations:** Enhance user events with historical browsing behavior to provide more relevant suggestions.
*   **Dynamic Pricing:** Augment order events with historical demand and inventory levels to optimize pricing in real-time.
