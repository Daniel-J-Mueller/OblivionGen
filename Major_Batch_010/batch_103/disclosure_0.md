## Dynamic Voltage Optimization via Distributed Transformerless Power Supplies

**Concept:** Instead of a central transformer stepping down voltage for the entire data center, integrate small, transformerless power supplies *directly* into each rack, and even potentially *within* each server. These units dynamically adjust their AC-DC conversion based on real-time server load and power demand, minimizing wasted energy and maximizing efficiency. This isn't just about stepping down voltage, it’s about intelligently *shaping* the delivered power.

**Specifications:**

*   **Power Supply Units (PSUs):**
    *   **Input:** Three-phase, 480V nominal (configurable via software - see below). Accepts wide voltage swings – 400V to 550V.
    *   **Output:** Fully modular DC outputs (12V, 48V, and potentially custom voltages) to match server requirements. High current capability (100A+ per module).
    *   **Topology:** Resonant LLC converters with digital control. Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFETs for high efficiency and switching frequency.
    *   **Communication:** Each PSU has a dedicated Ethernet port for communication with a central rack controller. Supports Modbus TCP/IP and a proprietary communication protocol for real-time data exchange.
    *   **Physical:** 2U form factor, designed for high-density rack mounting. Forced-air cooling with redundant fans.
*   **Rack Controller:**
    *   **Function:** Manages all PSUs within the rack. Collects real-time power data (voltage, current, power factor) from each PSU. Implements dynamic voltage optimization algorithms.
    *   **Algorithm:** Predictive algorithm based on server workload (CPU usage, memory access, network traffic). Adjusts PSU output voltage to minimize power loss without compromising stability. Incorporates machine learning for improved prediction accuracy.
    *   **Communication:** Connects to the data center management system (DCIM) via a secure API. Shares real-time power data and receives commands from DCIM.
    *   **Redundancy:** Dual redundant controllers with automatic failover.
*   **Data Center Management System (DCIM) Integration:**
    *   **DCIM API:**  Provides a standardized API for accessing real-time power data from each rack. Enables DCIM to monitor power usage, identify inefficiencies, and optimize energy consumption.
    *   **Predictive Maintenance:** Uses historical power data to predict PSU failures and schedule maintenance proactively.
    *   **Capacity Planning:**  Helps data center operators plan for future power needs based on current and projected workloads.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Microservices:** Each component (PSU controller, rack controller, DCIM integration) implemented as a separate microservice.
    *   **Containerization:**  Microservices deployed in Docker containers for portability and scalability.
    *   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes used to manage and scale the microservices.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Initial Implementation:**  Pilot deployment in a single rack with a limited number of servers. Gradual expansion to other racks based on performance and reliability.
    *   **Security:**  Secure communication channels and authentication mechanisms to protect against unauthorized access and cyberattacks.
    *   **Monitoring:**  Comprehensive monitoring system to track the health and performance of all components.

**Pseudocode (Rack Controller - Dynamic Voltage Adjustment):**

```
function adjust_voltage(server_load, current_voltage) {
  // Calculate target voltage based on server load and efficiency curve
  target_voltage = calculate_target_voltage(server_load)

  // Apply voltage adjustment with a limited rate of change
  voltage_change = min(max(target_voltage - current_voltage, -0.02), 0.02) // Limit to 2% change per cycle

  new_voltage = current_voltage + voltage_change

  // Send command to PSU to adjust output voltage
  send_voltage_command(new_voltage)

  return new_voltage
}

function calculate_target_voltage(server_load) {
  // Use a pre-defined efficiency curve to determine the optimal voltage for the given load
  // The curve is based on the efficiency characteristics of the PSU and the server power supplies

  if (server_load < 20%) {
    target_voltage = 260V
  } else if (server_load < 50%) {
    target_voltage = 267V
  } else if (server_load < 80%) {
    target_voltage = 277V
  } else {
    target_voltage = 287V
  }

  return target_voltage
}
