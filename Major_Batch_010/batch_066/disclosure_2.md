## Dynamic Contextual Graph Construction & Embedding

**Concept:** Instead of a static corpus graph, construct a graph dynamically *based on user interaction* and current query context. This allows for embeddings to be far more relevant than a pre-built graph can offer, and avoids the computational cost of embedding a massive, static corpus.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Structures:**

*   **Interaction History:** Each user maintains a history of interactions (queries, clicks, dwell time) with nodes in the corpus. This isnâ€™t stored as a full graph, but as a ranked list of node IDs and interaction weights (calculated from interaction type and duration).
*   **Context Vector:** A vector representing the current query/session context. Generated by a separate language model (e.g., BERT) processing the query and recent interaction history.
*   **Dynamic Edge Weighting Function:** A function that calculates the weight of an edge between two nodes *based on* the context vector and their interaction history.

**II. Graph Construction Process (per query):**

1.  **Seed Node Selection:** Identify the most relevant seed nodes based on initial query processing and the user's interaction history.
2.  **Contextual Expansion:**
    *   Starting from seed nodes, explore the corpus graph (potentially limiting depth to control computational cost).
    *   For each potential edge (node A -> node B):
        *   Calculate the edge weight using the `Dynamic Edge Weighting Function`: `weight = f(context_vector, interaction_history(A, B), static_graph_edge_weight)`.  This function should prioritize edges where the context vector aligns with the concepts represented by nodes A and B, and where there is a history of interaction.
        *   Filter edges below a certain weight threshold.
3.  **Sub-Graph Creation:** Construct a sub-graph consisting of the selected nodes and edges. This sub-graph is specific to the current query and user context.

**III. Embedding Generation:**

1.  **Node Embedding:** Generate node embeddings for the nodes in the sub-graph using a graph neural network (GNN).  The GNN architecture should be optimized for sparse graphs, as the sub-graphs will be relatively sparse.
2.  **Contextual Aggregation:** Aggregate the node embeddings using a weighted sum, where the weights are derived from the edge weights in the sub-graph.  This creates a single, context-aware embedding representing the query and its relevant context.

**IV. Pseudocode:**

```python
def generate_contextual_embedding(query, user_history, corpus_graph):
  # 1. Seed Node Selection
  seed_nodes = select_seed_nodes(query, user_history, corpus_graph)

  # 2. Contextual Expansion
  subgraph_nodes, subgraph_edges = build_contextual_subgraph(seed_nodes, query, user_history, corpus_graph)

  # 3. Embedding Generation
  node_embeddings = generate_node_embeddings(subgraph_nodes) # Using GNN

  # 4. Contextual Aggregation
  context_embedding = aggregate_embeddings(node_embeddings, subgraph_edges)

  return context_embedding

def build_contextual_subgraph(seed_nodes, query, user_history, corpus_graph, max_depth=3):
  # BFS/DFS expansion from seed nodes
  # Calculate edge weights using dynamic weighting function
  # Filter edges based on weight threshold
  # Return nodes and edges of the subgraph
  pass

def dynamic_edge_weighting(context_vector, interaction_history, static_edge_weight):
  # Calculate weight based on context vector alignment with node concepts
  # Incorporate interaction history
  # Return weight
  pass
```

**V. Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Relevance:**  Embeddings are far more relevant to the current query and user context.
*   **Reduced Computational Cost:** Only a small sub-graph needs to be embedded, reducing computational cost.
*   **Personalization:**  Embeddings are personalized to each user's interaction history.
*   **Adaptability:** The system adapts to changing user interests and new information in the corpus.
