## Dynamic Key Sharding with Ephemeral Attestation

**Concept:** Extend the idea of preventing persistent key storage by dynamically sharding a cryptographic key across multiple ephemeral virtual machines (VMs) and employing a continuous attestation process. This moves beyond simply *not* storing the key to actively distributing and verifying its existence without ever reconstituting the full key in a single location.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Key Sharding Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Master cryptographic key (e.g., AES-256).
    *   Process: Employ a Secret Sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing) to generate *n* shares of the key. Each share is a fixed-size data block.
    *   Output: *n* key shares.

2.  **Ephemeral VM Orchestration:**
    *   Hypervisor component manages creation & destruction of lightweight VMs.
    *   Each VM is assigned *one* key share.
    *   VM lifespan is short – measured in minutes/hours. Continuous rotation.
    *   VMs have limited network access – only to a central “Reconstitution Coordinator”.

3.  **Reconstitution Coordinator:**
    *   Responsible for:
        *   Requesting decryption/signing operations.
        *   Identifying active VMs holding key shares.
        *   Orchestrating distributed cryptographic operations *without* ever reassembling the full key.

4.  **Distributed Cryptographic Operation Flow:**
    *   Client requests decryption/signing.
    *   Reconstitution Coordinator identifies *n* active VMs.
    *   Coordinator distributes ciphertext/plaintext blocks to VMs.
    *   Each VM performs a local operation on its assigned block (e.g., XOR, modular arithmetic) using its key share.
    *   VMs return results to the Coordinator.
    *   Coordinator combines the partial results to produce the final decrypted/signed output.

5.  **Continuous Attestation:**
    *   Each VM periodically reports its status and a cryptographic hash of its key share to an Attestation Service.
    *   Attestation Service verifies VM integrity (e.g., using Trusted Platform Module (TPM) measurements).
    *   If a VM fails attestation or becomes unresponsive, its key share is considered compromised, and a new VM is launched with a replacement share.

6.  **Key Rotation & Rekeying:**
    *   New key shares are generated and distributed regularly (e.g., daily, weekly).
    *   Old shares are securely destroyed.
    *   Rekeying is triggered by security events (e.g., VM compromise, policy change).

**Pseudocode (Simplified Rekeying):**

```
// Rekeying Function - executed by Reconstitution Coordinator

function rekey(oldKey) {
  newKey = generateNewKey();  // Generate new master key
  numShares = 5; // Example - number of shares
  shares = generateShares(newKey, numShares);

  // Destroy old key shares (signal VMs to self-destruct)

  for each share in shares {
    launchNewEphemeralVM(share); // Launch new VM with share
  }
}
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Network Security:** Secure communication channels between VMs and the Coordinator are critical (e.g., TLS, VPN).
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Implement redundancy to handle VM failures.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a large number of VMs and cryptographic operations.
*   **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive audit logs for all key operations and VM lifecycle events.
*   **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):**  HSMs can be used to protect the initial master key and generate key shares.

This design moves beyond simply avoiding persistent storage to actively mitigating the risk of key compromise through distribution, rotation, and continuous attestation.
