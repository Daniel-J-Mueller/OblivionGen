## Dynamic Manifest Branching & Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the pattern detection to *predict* future segment patterns and proactively branch the manifest. This allows for pre-buffering on the client and significantly reduces latency, particularly in variable network conditions.

**Specs:**

1.  **Pattern History Buffer:** Maintain a rolling buffer of detected patterns (e.g., the last 5-10 cycles) for each stream. This history informs prediction.

2.  **Probabilistic Prediction Engine:**  Implement an engine which uses the pattern history to calculate probabilities for the *next* segment sequence. This isn't a deterministic 'next pattern' but a weighted distribution of likely patterns.  Consider Markov Chain modeling, or even lightweight neural networks trained on historical manifest data.

3.  **Manifest Branching:**  When the prediction engine yields a probability distribution exceeding a certain threshold (e.g., 80% confidence in the top 3 likely patterns), the manifest generator creates multiple 'branches' of the manifest, each representing one of the high-probability patterns.

4.  **Client-Side Manifest Selection:** The client device (player) receives the main manifest *and* the branched manifests. It monitors the incoming segments. When a segment arrives that *matches* the beginning of one of the branched manifests, the client switches to consuming that branch.

5.  **Branch Pruning:** If a branch remains unused for a specified period (e.g., 3-5 cycles), it's discarded to conserve bandwidth and client memory.

6.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Adapt the prediction threshold based on network conditions.  In stable, high-bandwidth conditions, a higher threshold can be used for more aggressive branching.  In unstable conditions, a lower threshold allows for more frequent, but potentially less accurate, branching.

**Pseudocode (Manifest Generator):**

```
function generateManifest(streamData):
  patternHistory = getPatternHistory(streamData)
  predictionResults = predictNextPattern(patternHistory)

  mainManifest = createBaseManifest(streamData)

  if predictionResults.confidence > threshold:
    for pattern in predictionResults.topPatterns:
      branchedManifest = createBranchedManifest(pattern, streamData)
      addBranchedManifest(branchedManifest, mainManifest)

  return mainManifest
```

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Player):**

```
onSegmentReceived(segment):
  if currentManifest is branchedManifest:
    // Continue consuming branched manifest
  else:
    // Check if segment matches start of any branched manifests
    for branchedManifest in branchedManifests:
      if segment matches first segment of branchedManifest:
        switchToBranchedManifest(branchedManifest)
        break
    // If no match, continue consuming main manifest
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Metadata:** Include metadata in each branched manifest to identify which pattern it represents and the confidence level of the prediction.
*   **Fallback Mechanism:** Implement a robust fallback mechanism to switch back to the main manifest if a branched manifest becomes invalid or unavailable.
*   **Server-Side Monitoring:** Monitor the effectiveness of the branching mechanism (e.g., the number of switches between manifests, the latency reduction) to optimize the prediction engine and branching parameters.
