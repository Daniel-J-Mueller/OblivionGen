## Dynamic UAV Payload Calibration & Autonomous Rebalancing System

**Concept:** Integrate the weight/CoM determination system with a robotic payload manipulation system *while* the UAV is still grounded, allowing for automated rebalancing and optimization *before* flight. This goes beyond simply *measuring* weight; it *actively corrects* imbalances.

**System Specs:**

*   **Ground Station Integration:** The existing scale system is integrated into a robotic workcell. This includes a robotic arm with a custom end-effector designed to grasp and reposition payloads.
*   **Payload Library:** A database of known payload weights, dimensions, and CoM data.  New payloads can be added manually or via optical scanning (see below).
*   **Optical Scanning Subsystem:**  A high-resolution 3D scanner (structured light or time-of-flight) integrated with the workcell to automatically determine the dimensions and, with material density estimation, the weight and CoM of unknown payloads.
*   **Automated Payload Placement:** The robotic arm, guided by the system, will automatically place payloads on designated mounting points on the UAV.
*   **Real-time Weight/CoM Feedback:** The scale system provides real-time weight and CoM data to a control processor.
*   **Rebalancing Algorithm:** The control processor runs an algorithm that determines the optimal payload arrangement to achieve a desired CoM (e.g., centered, forward-biased for speed, etc.). This may involve swapping payload positions or adding small ballast weights.
*   **Actuated Payload Mounts:** The UAV features payload mounts with limited axial movement (linear actuators or micro-robotic positioning systems). The system can subtly adjust the position of individual payloads to fine-tune the CoM.
*   **Pre-Flight Verification:** Before flight, the system performs a final CoM verification and generates a report indicating the UAV’s balanced state.
*   **Communication Protocol:** A standardized protocol for interfacing with the UAV’s flight controller to transmit the calibrated CoM data. The flight controller will utilize this information for optimized flight control.

**Pseudocode (Rebalancing Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION RebalanceUAV(desired_CoM, current_CoM, payload_list, UAV_payload_mounts):
  //payload_list contains weight, dimensions, current_position
  //UAV_payload_mounts represents the range of movement for each mount

  FOR each payload in payload_list:
    delta_x = desired_CoM.x - current_CoM.x
    delta_y = desired_CoM.y - current_CoM.y
    
    //Calculate force required to shift payload to new position
    required_force_x = delta_x * payload.weight
    required_force_y = delta_y * payload.weight

    //Check if move is within mount's range of motion
    IF move_possible(payload.position, payload.position + (required_force_x, required_force_y), UAV_payload_mounts):
      move_payload(payload, (required_force_x, required_force_y))
      recalculate_CoM()
    ELSE:
      //Attempt to swap with another payload
      FOR each other_payload in payload_list:
        IF swap_possible(payload, other_payload, UAV_payload_mounts):
          swap_payloads(payload, other_payload)
          recalculate_CoM()
          BREAK //exit inner loop
      ENDIF
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR
  
  //IF CoM still off, add ballast (optional)
  IF CoM_off:
     add_ballast(CoM_off_direction, calculated_weight)
  ENDIF

  RETURN calibrated_CoM
END FUNCTION
