## Dynamic Host Avatar & Environment Projection

**Concept:** Extend the live video stream experience by dynamically altering the host's projected avatar and background environment to reflect the currently discussed product *and* viewer sentiment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Avatar & Environment Capture & Processing:**

*   **Input:** Live video stream of host. Real-time viewer sentiment data (aggregated from chat, reactions, polls - see Sentiment Analysis Module). Product metadata (images, 3D models, associated themes/environments) from media server.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Host Segmentation:**  Isolate the host from the background using computer vision.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:**  Module to gauge overall viewer sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, excited, bored) – assigns a ‘sentiment score’.
    *   **Product Association:** Based on current product, select a relevant 3D environment and avatar customization options (clothing, accessories, visual effects).
    *   **Dynamic Rendering:**  Composite the host onto the chosen 3D environment. Apply visual effects to the avatar based on both product association *and* sentiment score.

**2. Visual Effect Parameters (Examples):**

*   **Positive Sentiment (High Score):**  Avatar glows softly, environment becomes more vibrant, celebratory particles (confetti, sparks) are emitted.
*   **Negative Sentiment (Low Score):**  Environment darkens slightly, avatar displays subtle signs of distress (e.g., slumped posture, muted colors).
*   **Product-Specific Effects:**  If showcasing a coffee maker, the environment could be a cozy café.  For a gaming console, a futuristic cityscape. Avatar could wear attire relevant to the product (e.g., gaming headset).
*   **Intensity Scaling:**  Effect intensity scales with sentiment score.  Subtle changes for minor shifts, dramatic changes for strong reactions.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Component 1: Video Ingest & Processing Module:** Receives live stream, performs host segmentation.
*   **Component 2: Sentiment Analysis Module:** Processes viewer input, generates sentiment score.  Utilizes NLP and machine learning.
*   **Component 3: Product Metadata Manager:** Stores and retrieves product data, environment associations.
*   **Component 4: Dynamic Rendering Engine:**  Composes the final output.  Requires a powerful GPU for real-time rendering.
*   **Component 5: Stream Output Module:**  Sends the rendered stream to viewers.

**4. Pseudocode (Rendering Engine):**

```
function renderFrame(hostImage, sentimentScore, productData) {
    environment = productData.associatedEnvironment;
    avatarCustomization = productData.avatarCustomization;

    // Apply sentiment-based adjustments
    if (sentimentScore > 0.7) {
        environment.brightness += 0.2;
        avatar.emissionColor = "gold";
    } else if (sentimentScore < 0.3) {
        environment.brightness -= 0.1;
        avatar.color = desaturate(avatar.color, 0.5);
    }

    // Composite avatar onto environment
    finalImage = composite(avatar, environment);

    return finalImage;
}

```

**5. User Interface Considerations:**

*   Optional toggle for viewers to disable the dynamic effects (accessibility).
*   Visual indicator of current sentiment score (subtle overlay).
*   Potentially allow viewers to influence the effects through real-time voting/polls.
