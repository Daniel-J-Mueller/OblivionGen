**Dynamic Change Log Compaction via Predictive Analysis**

**System Specs:**

*   **Components:** Change Log Manager, Predictive Analytics Engine, Compaction Scheduler, Storage Tiering Manager.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   Change Log Segments: Immutable, time-ordered records of database changes.
    *   Metadata Store: Stores segment metadata (timestamp, partition, size, access frequency).
    *   Prediction Model: Machine learning model predicting future segment access probabilities.
*   **APIs:**
    *   `LogSegmentCreated(segment)`: Notifies the system of a new log segment.
    *   `GetSegmentAccessProbability(segment)`: Returns predicted access probability.
    *   `ScheduleCompaction(segments)`: Schedules segments for compaction.

**Innovation Description:**

This system dynamically compacts change logs based on *predicted* access patterns rather than solely on retention policies or segment size. The Predictive Analytics Engine uses historical access data (reads, restores, audits) to forecast the likelihood of future access for each change log segment. Segments with low predicted access are prioritized for compaction, reducing storage costs and improving query performance.

**Detailed Operation:**

1.  **Segment Creation:** When a new change log segment is created, the `LogSegmentCreated` API is called. The segment metadata is stored, and the prediction model is updated with the new segment's existence.
2.  **Access Monitoring:** All access requests to change log segments are logged, including timestamps, user/application, and data accessed.
3.  **Prediction Model Training:** The Predictive Analytics Engine periodically retrains the prediction model using the logged access data. Features used for prediction include:
    *   Segment age.
    *   Partition.
    *   Access frequency (historical).
    *   Application accessing the segment.
    *   Time of day/week.
4.  **Compaction Scheduling:** The Compaction Scheduler runs periodically and selects segments for compaction based on the predicted access probabilities.  A threshold value (configurable) is used to determine which segments are candidates for compaction.
5.  **Storage Tiering:**  Compacted segments are moved to a lower-cost storage tier (e.g., object storage) while maintaining data accessibility for potential restore operations.
6.  **Adaptive Thresholding:** The compaction threshold is dynamically adjusted based on overall system load, storage capacity, and predicted data growth.

**Pseudocode (Compaction Scheduler):**

```
function ScheduleCompaction():
  segments = GetUncompactedSegments()
  for segment in segments:
    accessProbability = GetSegmentAccessProbability(segment)
    if accessProbability < compactionThreshold:
      ScheduleSegmentForCompaction(segment)
  AdjustCompactionThreshold() // Based on system metrics
```

**Novelty:**

Traditional change log compaction relies on time-based retention or size thresholds. This system introduces predictive analysis to optimize compaction, reducing unnecessary compaction of frequently accessed segments and maximizing storage efficiency. Itâ€™s an active, intelligent compaction system rather than a passive one.
