## Dynamic API Composition via AI-Driven Orchestration

**Specification:** System for composing APIs on-the-fly based on real-time contextual data and predicted user intent, extending the proxy API concept.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Contextual Data Ingestion:** Module to gather data from various sources â€“ user profile, device type, location, time of day, historical API usage, application state, sensor data, etc.  Data is normalized and converted into a feature vector.
2.  **Intent Prediction Engine:**  A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network or transformer) trained to predict the *desired outcome* of the user's request, given the contextual feature vector.  Output is a probability distribution over potential API *sequences* (not just single API calls).  This prediction engine is continuously retrained with user feedback (implicit - success/failure of API sequences - or explicit - ratings/reviews).
3.  **API Graph:** A knowledge graph representing all available APIs, their parameters, dependencies, and potential outputs.  Nodes are APIs, edges represent data flow or dependencies.  API metadata includes cost, latency, security requirements, and functional description.
4.  **API Orchestration Engine:** This engine takes the predicted API sequence (from the Intent Prediction Engine) and the API Graph to construct a dynamically composed API workflow. It optimizes this workflow based on constraints (cost, latency, security) and available resources.
5.  **Dynamic Proxy Generation:** A module that generates a *new* proxy API on-the-fly, based on the orchestrated workflow. This new API acts as a single endpoint for the user.
6.  **Real-time Monitoring & Adaptation:** Module to monitor performance of generated APIs, collect feedback, and adapt the Intent Prediction Engine and API Orchestration Engine in real-time.

**Pseudocode (API Orchestration Engine):**

```
function orchestrateAPI(predictedAPISequence, APIGraph, constraints):
  # A* search algorithm with cost function incorporating latency, cost, security.
  # Heuristic function estimates remaining cost to reach desired outcome.
  bestWorkflow = AStarSearch(APIGraph, predictedAPISequence, constraints)

  # Validate workflow for security vulnerabilities and data privacy compliance.
  if not isValidWorkflow(bestWorkflow):
    return Error("Invalid Workflow")

  # Optimize workflow for performance.
  optimizedWorkflow = optimizeWorkflow(bestWorkflow)

  return optimizedWorkflow
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **API Node:** { API_ID, function_name, input_parameters, output_parameters, dependencies, cost, latency, security_level }
*   **Workflow:**  Sequence of API Nodes, with data flow connections between them.

**Innovation:**  The system moves beyond simple API *mapping* to dynamic API *composition*. It doesn't just translate a request to a known API; it intelligently assembles a custom workflow of APIs to achieve the user's *intended outcome*, even if that outcome requires chaining together multiple APIs in a novel way.  The ML component allows the system to learn and adapt to user needs, improving the accuracy and efficiency of API composition over time. This is akin to a 'compiler' for APIs, taking high-level intent and translating it into executable API workflows.
