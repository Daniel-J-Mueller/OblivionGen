**Adaptive Data Sharding Based on Read/Write Ratios**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust data sharding across nodes based on observed read/write ratios for specific data subsets.  The goal is to optimize performance by co-locating frequently written data on nodes capable of handling writes (read-write nodes) and frequently read data on read-only nodes.

**II. Components:**

*   **Ratio Monitor:** A service monitoring read/write access patterns for different data partitions.  This could be implemented as a sidecar process on each node or a centralized monitoring service. It tracks requests at the data partition level, not just overall node load.
*   **Sharding Manager:** A control plane component responsible for initiating and managing data movement.  It receives recommendations from the Ratio Monitor and orchestrates data re-sharding.
*   **Data Mover:**  A background process (or a distributed task queue) that physically moves data between nodes.  It leverages consistent hashing or similar techniques to minimize data disruption.
*   **Metadata Store:**  A persistent store mapping data partitions to physical node locations. The Sharding Manager and Data Mover utilize this metadata.

**III. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Monitoring:** The Ratio Monitor continuously tracks read/write ratios for each data partition.
2.  **Thresholding:**  When a partition's read/write ratio exceeds or falls below a pre-defined threshold (configurable per partition type), the Ratio Monitor sends an alert to the Sharding Manager.
3.  **Re-Sharding Decision:** The Sharding Manager evaluates the alert and determines if re-sharding is beneficial. Factors considered include network bandwidth, node capacity, and potential disruption.
4.  **Data Movement:** If re-sharding is approved, the Sharding Manager instructs the Data Mover to migrate the affected data partition to a more suitable node.  Data is moved in small chunks to minimize impact. Consistent hashing ensures minimal disruption to ongoing requests.
5.  **Metadata Update:** The Sharding Manager updates the Metadata Store to reflect the new data location.
6.  **Verification:** The system verifies the successful data migration and updates the routing layer to direct requests to the new location.

**IV. Pseudocode (Sharding Manager - Re-Sharding Decision Logic):**

```pseudocode
function decide_resharding(partition_id, read_write_ratio):
  threshold_high = 0.9 // Example: Mostly reads
  threshold_low = 0.1  // Example: Mostly writes

  current_node = get_node_for_partition(partition_id)

  if read_write_ratio > threshold_high and current_node is read-write node:
    //Move to read-only node
    new_node = find_available_read_only_node()
    if new_node is not null:
      trigger_data_move(partition_id, new_node)
      return true
  
  elif read_write_ratio < threshold_low and current_node is read-only node:
    //Move to read-write node
    new_node = find_available_read_write_node()
    if new_node is not null:
      trigger_data_move(partition_id, new_node)
      return true

  return false //No action needed
```

**V. Considerations:**

*   **Data Consistency:** Employ techniques like two-phase commit or conflict-free replication to ensure data consistency during migration.
*   **Load Balancing:**  Monitor node load and proactively re-shard data to prevent hotspots.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adapt thresholds based on overall system load and performance.
*   **Automation:** Fully automate the re-sharding process to minimize manual intervention.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Design the system to handle node failures during migration.
