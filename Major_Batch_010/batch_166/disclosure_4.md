## Dynamic Capability Mapping via Auditory Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend the auditory input/capability activation paradigm to incorporate real-time biofeedback, specifically galvanic skin response (GSR) and potentially EEG, to dynamically map device capabilities to user intent *without* explicit voice commands. This moves beyond simply *responding* to commands to *anticipating* needs based on physiological signals.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Integrated GSR sensor (worn as a wristband or integrated into device housing)
    *   Optional EEG headset integration (for more granular intent detection)
    *   Existing microphone array for initial voice-based capability association and baseline calibration
    *   Existing processing unit (as defined in the patent)
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Bio-Signal Acquisition:** Real-time acquisition of GSR and/or EEG data.  Sampling rate: GSR - 4Hz, EEG - 256Hz (adjustable).
    *   **Baseline Calibration:**  Initial calibration phase where the system learns the user's physiological baseline in a neutral state and during known capability activations (e.g., saying "activate camera").  This establishes a "signature" for each capability.  Calibration duration: 5 minutes minimum.
    *   **Intent Inference Engine:**  This module utilizes a machine learning model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model, Recurrent Neural Network) to predict user intent based on deviations from the baseline bio-signals. Input: GSR/EEG data stream. Output: Probability distribution across all available device capabilities.
    *   **Contextual Filtering:** Incorporates contextual data (time of day, location, prior user actions, calendar events) to refine the intent inference.
    *   **Capability Activation:** Triggers the appropriate device capability based on the highest-probability intent prediction.  Confidence threshold (adjustable) to prevent accidental activations.
    *   **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously refines the intent inference model based on user feedback (implicit – successful/unsuccessful activations – and explicit – voice correction).  Utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize prediction accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Intent Inference Engine):**

```
function inferIntent(gsrData, eegData, contextData):
  // Preprocess data (noise reduction, feature extraction)
  processedData = preprocess(gsrData, eegData)

  // Apply machine learning model
  prediction = model.predict(processedData, contextData) // Returns probability distribution

  // Apply confidence threshold
  if max(prediction) > confidenceThreshold:
    predictedCapability = argmax(prediction)
    return predictedCapability
  else:
    return null // No clear intent detected
```

**Refinement:**

The system can be enhanced with "anticipatory activation."  Based on predicted intent, the system can *pre-stage* the capability (e.g., pre-focus the camera) before full activation, reducing latency.  The biofeedback loop also allows for *automatic* capability discovery. If the system detects a consistent physiological response to a novel action, it can prompt the user to assign a capability to that action, effectively expanding the device's functionality. The system should also be capable of detecting 'stress' or 'cognitive load' via GSR data and proactively suggest assistive capabilities (e.g. turning on 'do not disturb', or initiating a calming audio track).
