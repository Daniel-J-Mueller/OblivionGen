**Adaptive Metamaterial Projection System**

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Technology:** Dynamically reconfigurable metamaterial layers integrated *within* the wedge-shaped prisms. These layers will manipulate light at a subwavelength scale.
*   **Metamaterial Composition:** Electrically tunable liquid crystals or micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) based resonators arranged in precise patterns.
*   **Control System:**  A high-speed FPGA-based controller coupled with real-time image processing algorithms. Input will include environment mapping data (from depth sensors or similar) and desired image projection parameters.
*   **Prism Configuration:** Utilize at least three independently rotatable wedge-shaped prisms per projection channel.  The metamaterial layers will be embedded within these prisms, forming the active steering and focusing elements. Prism material: Borosilicate glass for thermal stability and optical clarity.
*   **Wavelength Range:** Visible spectrum (400-700nm), with potential expansion into near-infrared and ultraviolet through metamaterial design.
*   **Resolution:** Dynamically adjustable, up to 4K per projection channel.
*   **Refresh Rate:**  Up to 240 Hz.
*   **IR Integration:**  Separate IR illumination path, modulated for depth mapping and gesture recognition. IR source positioned to provide uniform illumination across the target area. IR modulated at high frequency for noise reduction.
*   **Power Supply:**  Low-voltage DC power supply. Energy efficient design to minimize heat generation.
*   **Cooling System:**  Passive heat sinks combined with micro-fans if necessary.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Ethernet or Wi-Fi for control and data transfer.

**Innovation Description:**

The system moves beyond simple beam steering via prism rotation.  By embedding dynamically reconfigurable metamaterials within the prisms, we achieve:

1.  **Holographic Projection:** The metamaterials can sculpt the wavefront of light, enabling true holographic projections that appear three-dimensional and change with viewing angle.  This requires real-time computation of the diffraction patterns and control of the metamaterial elements.

2.  **Volumetric Display:** By precisely controlling the light distribution, we can create light spots at specific 3D coordinates, forming a true volumetric display.

3.  **Adaptive Focus and Correction:** The metamaterials can compensate for distortions and aberrations in the optical path, ensuring a sharp, focused image regardless of surface irregularities or environmental factors.

4.  **Dynamic Beam Shaping:** The system can shape the projected beam to match the contours of the target surface, maximizing brightness and contrast. It could produce 'negative space' in a beam, allowing for light to pass around certain points, which could create interesting visual effects.

5.  **Computational Imaging:** Utilize the metamaterials for computational imaging techniques like light field imaging or coded aperture imaging.

**Pseudocode (simplified control loop):**

```
// Initialize metamaterial control system, IR source, depth sensors

while (true) {
    // Acquire environment map from depth sensors
    environmentMap = getEnvironmentMap();

    // Process environment map to identify target surfaces and obstacles
    targetSurfaces = identifyTargetSurfaces(environmentMap);

    // Calculate optimal prism angles and metamaterial configurations for each target surface
    for each (surface in targetSurfaces) {
        prismAngles[surface.id] = calculatePrismAngles(surface);
        metamaterialConfig[surface.id] = calculateMetamaterialConfig(surface);
    }

    // Apply prism angles and metamaterial configurations
    setPrismAngles(prismAngles);
    setMetamaterialConfig(metamaterialConfig);

    // Update IR illumination based on environment map and gesture recognition
    updateIRIllumination();

    // Render image data
    renderImageData();
}
```

The system represents a significant departure from traditional beam steering techniques, allowing for dynamic, high-resolution, and truly immersive augmented reality experiences. The complexity of controlling the metamaterials is high, but the potential benefits are substantial.
