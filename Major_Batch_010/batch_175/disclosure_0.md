## Propeller-Based Acoustic Resonance System

**Concept:** Utilize propeller blade geometry and rotational speed, combined with onboard microphones, to generate and modulate localized acoustic resonance for directed energy transfer or environmental manipulation.

**Specifications:**

*   **Propeller Design:** Blades incorporate embedded piezoelectric elements and micro-channels for fluid/gas flow control. Blade surfaces are coated with a material optimized for acoustic impedance matching (e.g., metamaterial composite). Variable geometry sections on blades allow for active shape control.
*   **Microphone Array:** An array of high-sensitivity, directional microphones is integrated into the aerial vehicle frame, strategically positioned around the propellers. Beamforming capabilities are essential.
*   **Control System:** Real-time processing unit with the following capabilities:
    *   **Propeller Speed Modulation:** Precise control of each propeller’s RPM.
    *   **Piezoelectric Element Activation:** Independent control of piezoelectric elements within each blade.
    *   **Fluid/Gas Flow Control:** Regulation of flow through micro-channels in blades.
    *   **Acoustic Modeling:** Software that predicts acoustic field patterns based on propeller geometry, speed, and piezoelectric/flow activation.
    *   **Beamforming Algorithm:** Controls microphone array to focus acoustic energy.
*   **Operating Modes:**
    *   **Directed Acoustic Energy:** Focuses acoustic energy to a specific point for non-destructive testing, material manipulation (e.g., levitation of small objects), or targeted disruption.
    *   **Acoustic Shielding:** Generates an acoustic “bubble” around the aerial vehicle to reduce noise signature or protect from acoustic attacks.
    *   **Environmental Mapping:** Uses acoustic reflections to create 3D maps of the surrounding environment, even in low-visibility conditions.
    *   **Communication:** Modulate the acoustic field for short-range, secure communication.

**Pseudocode (Acoustic Focusing – Simplified):**

```
FUNCTION focusAcousticEnergy(targetX, targetY, targetZ):
    // Calculate required blade adjustments based on target coordinates
    bladeAdjustments = calculateBladeAdjustments(targetX, targetY, targetZ)

    // Adjust propeller speeds and piezoelectric activation levels
    FOR EACH propeller IN propellerArray:
        propeller.setSpeed(bladeAdjustments[propeller.ID].speed)
        propeller.activatePiezo(bladeAdjustments[propeller.ID].piezoLevel)

    // Adjust fluid/gas flow
    FOR EACH propeller IN propellerArray:
        propeller.setFlowRate(bladeAdjustments[propeller.ID].flowRate)

    // Optimize microphone array beamforming
    microphoneArray.setFocus(targetX, targetY, targetZ)
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateBladeAdjustments(targetX, targetY, targetZ):
    // Use acoustic modeling to determine optimal blade speeds,
    // piezoelectric activation, and flow rates
    // based on target coordinates.
    // Consider blade geometry, material properties, and
    // environmental factors.
    // Returns an array of adjustments for each propeller.
    // (This function is complex and requires significant computational resources.)
    // Placeholder for now.
    RETURN adjustments
END FUNCTION
