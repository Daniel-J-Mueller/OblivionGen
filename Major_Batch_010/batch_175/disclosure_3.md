## Dynamic Component Swapping for A/B Testing in WebAssembly

**Specification:** A system for dynamic A/B testing of client-side components utilizing WebAssembly modules, facilitating near-instantaneous switching of component implementations without full page reloads or network requests.

**Core Concept:** The system maintains a registry of functionally equivalent WebAssembly modules representing different variations of a component. These modules expose a standardized interface. A central control mechanism, residing within the browser (as a dedicated worker thread or similar), can swap the currently active module for a given component ID with minimal disruption.

**Components:**

*   **Component Registry:** A mapping of component IDs to a list of available WebAssembly modules. Each module entry includes metadata – version, experimental flags, performance metrics – for intelligent selection.
*   **Interface Definition:** A standardized set of functions and data structures that all component modules must implement. This ensures interchangeability.  A strongly typed interface description language (IDL) should be used.
*   **Module Loader:**  Responsible for fetching and caching WebAssembly modules. Asynchronous loading prevents blocking the main thread.
*   **Swap Mechanism:** A function that replaces a currently executing component’s WebAssembly module with a new one.  This *must* handle state migration or reset gracefully.  The key is to minimize disruption – ideally, a seamless transition.
*   **Experiment Manager:**  A component responsible for determining which variation of a component to display based on user segmentation, experiment rules, and performance metrics. 

**Pseudocode (Swap Mechanism):**

```
function swapComponent(componentId, newModulePath) {
  // 1. Load the new WebAssembly module asynchronously.
  let newModule = await loadWebAssemblyModule(newModulePath);

  // 2. Get the currently active module (if any).
  let currentModule = getActiveModule(componentId);

  // 3.  Freeze current state. (Important for data integrity)
  let currentState = captureComponentState(componentId, currentModule);

  // 4. Unload the current module.
  unloadModule(currentModule);

  // 5. Initialize the new module with the captured state.
  initializeModule(newModule, currentState);

  // 6. Register the new module as active.
  setActiveModule(componentId, newModule);

  // 7. Signal any listeners that the component has been updated.
}

function captureComponentState(componentId, module) {
  //Call exported function in webassembly module to capture component state
  //Exported function returns a serialized object representing the component state
  //Serialization format is agreed upon in interface definition
  return module.export.captureState(componentId)
}

function initializeModule(module, state) {
  //Call exported function in webassembly module to initialize with state
  module.export.initialize(state);
}
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   **WebAssembly’s strengths:** WebAssembly’s near-native performance and sandboxed execution make it ideal for running different component variations.
*   **State Management:** Serialization/Deserialization of component state is crucial.  Consider efficient binary formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers, FlatBuffers).
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is essential.  If a new module fails to load or initialize, the system should gracefully revert to the previous version.
*   **Experimentation Framework Integration:**  Integrate with existing A/B testing frameworks (e.g., Optimizely, LaunchDarkly).

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Faster A/B Testing:** Near-instantaneous component switching accelerates the A/B testing process.
*   **Improved User Experience:**  Seamless transitions minimize disruption to the user experience.
*   **Reduced Network Overhead:**  Eliminates the need to download new JavaScript code for each experiment.
*   **Increased Flexibility:**  Allows for dynamic configuration and customization of client-side components.
