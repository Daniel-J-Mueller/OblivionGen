## Dynamic Document Reconstruction via Perceptual Chunking

**Concept:** Expand upon the noise-to-content ratio concept to not merely *remove* portions of a document, but *reconstruct* it dynamically based on perceived user intent and perceptual "chunks." The core idea is to move beyond simple ratio thresholds and incorporate a predictive model of how a user will *consume* the document.

**Specs:**

**1. Perceptual Chunking Module:**

*   **Input:** Electronic document (Markup Language) + User Interaction Data (mouse movements, scroll speed, dwell time on sections, click events, keystrokes – if a document editor)
*   **Process:**
    *   Divide the document into initial chunks based on structural elements (headings, paragraphs, lists).
    *   Analyze user interaction data *in real-time*.
    *   Dynamically refine chunk boundaries based on:
        *   **Dwell Time:** Sections with longer dwell times are prioritized and expanded.
        *   **Scroll Speed:** Rapid scrolling suggests low interest; chunks are collapsed or summarized. Slow, deliberate scrolling indicates high interest.
        *   **Eye-Tracking Data (Optional):**  If available, directly map user gaze to document sections for precise interest identification.
        *   **Keyword Density & Relevance:**  Within a chunk, identify key terms and concepts. Compare these to user search queries (if the document was accessed via search) or previous user interactions.
    *   Generate a “Perceptual Chunk Map” – a hierarchical representation of document sections weighted by perceived user interest.

**2. Noise/Content Ratio Re-Evaluation Module:**

*   **Input:** Perceptual Chunk Map, Original Document, Noise/Content Ratio Data (from the original patent)
*   **Process:**
    *   Re-evaluate the noise/content ratio *within each Perceptual Chunk*. The original ratios are used as a baseline, but weighted by the chunk's interest score from the Perceptual Chunk Map.
    *   Apply adaptive thresholds: High-interest chunks have *lower* thresholds for content retention. Low-interest chunks have *higher* thresholds for removal.
    *   Identify candidate sections for dynamic adjustment (expansion, contraction, or removal).

**3. Dynamic Document Reconstruction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Candidate sections, Original Document, Perceptual Chunk Map, User Preferences (e.g., preferred summarization length)
*   **Process:**
    *   **Expansion:**  For high-interest sections, expand collapsed content (e.g., show full paragraphs instead of summaries). Dynamically load related content (e.g., from footnotes or linked documents)
    *   **Contraction:** For low-interest sections, aggressively summarize content, reduce image resolution, or remove non-essential details.
    *   **Removal:**  Remove sections that consistently score low on both noise/content ratio and perceptual interest.
    *   **Content Re-Flow:** Seamlessly re-flow the document to maintain readability and visual coherence after adjustments.

**4.  Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** User Interaction Data, Document Structure, Perceptual Chunk Map, Noise/Content Ratio Data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network) to *predict* future user interest based on historical interaction patterns.
    *   Proactively adjust document rendering *before* the user interacts with a section, anticipating their needs.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Module):**

```
function predict_user_interest(user_history, document_structure, perceptual_map):
  // Train a RNN model on user interaction data (scroll speed, dwell time, clicks)
  // Input: Document structure, Perceptual Map, User History
  // Output: Probability score for each section indicating likely user interest

  // Input features:
  //  - Section Heading
  //  - Section Type (heading, paragraph, list)
  //  - Perceptual Chunk Map score
  //  - User's past interactions with similar sections

  // Model: RNN (LSTM or GRU)

  predicted_interest_scores = RNN.predict(input_features)

  return predicted_interest_scores
```

**Output:** Dynamically adjusted electronic document rendered in real-time, optimized for the individual user's perceived needs and interests.
