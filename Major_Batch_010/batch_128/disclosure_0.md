## Adaptive Security Policy Engine with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the hardware security accelerator to incorporate real-time behavioral biometric analysis of network traffic *in addition to* packet content and header inspection. This will allow for dynamic, adaptive security policies based on observed user/device behavior, rather than static rules.

**Specifications:**

*   **Behavioral Data Acquisition Module:**
    *   Captures inter-packet arrival times, packet size variations, TCP window size fluctuations, and other network timing characteristics.
    *   Implements statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, entropy) on these characteristics over sliding time windows.
    *   Hardware implementation for high-throughput capture and analysis.
*   **Biometric Profile Database:**
    *   Stores baseline profiles for known users/devices, representing their typical network behavior.
    *   Utilizes a content-addressable memory (CAM) for rapid lookup of established profiles.
    *   Supports multiple profiles per user/device to account for varying contexts (e.g., different applications, locations).
*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:**
    *   Compares real-time network behavior against established biometric profiles.
    *   Employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Support Vector Machines) implemented in hardware for fast anomaly scoring.
    *   Dynamically adjusts anomaly thresholds based on the severity of the detected deviation.
*   **Policy Adaptation Module:**
    *   Integrates anomaly scores with existing security policies.
    *   Dynamically adjusts security actions (e.g., encryption levels, authentication requirements, traffic filtering) based on anomaly scores.
    *   Can trigger alerts or initiate automated incident response actions.
*   **Hardware Architecture:**
    *   Integrate as a co-processor alongside the existing hardware security accelerator.
    *   Utilize dedicated hardware resources for biometric data acquisition, feature extraction, anomaly detection, and policy adaptation.
    *   Implement communication with the main processor via a high-speed interface (e.g., PCIe).
    *   Utilize a shared memory architecture for efficient data exchange.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
// Function: DetectAnomaly(packetData, profileID)
// Input: Packet data, User/Device profile ID
// Output: Anomaly Score (0.0 - 1.0)

function DetectAnomaly(packetData, profileID):
    // Retrieve profile from Biometric Profile Database
    profile = GetProfile(profileID)

    // Extract behavioral features from packetData
    features = ExtractFeatures(packetData)

    // Calculate deviation from profile features
    deviation = CalculateDeviation(features, profile.features)

    // Calculate anomaly score based on deviation
    anomalyScore = ApplyAnomalyFunction(deviation) // e.g., sigmoid function

    return anomalyScore
```

**Novelty:** Existing hardware security accelerators focus primarily on cryptographic operations and packet content inspection. This design introduces real-time behavioral biometrics as a proactive security layer, enabling adaptive policies based on *how* users/devices interact with the network, rather than simply *what* they send. This can detect compromised devices or malicious actors exhibiting unusual behavior, even if the traffic itself appears legitimate.
