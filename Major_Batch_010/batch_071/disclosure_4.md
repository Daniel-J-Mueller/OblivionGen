## Dynamic AOR Prioritization & Contextual Routing

**Specification:** Implement a system for dynamically prioritizing and routing calls based on real-time contextual data *beyond* AOR association. The core concept is to layer ‘intent scores’ onto AOR routing, enabling nuanced connection behavior.

**Components:**

*   **Contextual Data Ingestion:** System must integrate with various data sources:
    *   Calendar data (meetings, appointments)
    *   Location services (user/device location)
    *   Activity monitoring (e.g., driving mode, do not disturb)
    *   Application usage (e.g., in a video conference)
*   **Intent Scoring Engine:** An AI/ML model that calculates an ‘intent score’ for each potential AOR based on the ingested contextual data.  Example:
    *   User is in a calendar event labeled “Critical Project Meeting” – high intent score for AOR associated with work colleagues.
    *   User is driving – high intent score for hands-free communication AOR (car system) and low intent for general communication AOR.
    *   User is actively in a video conference - extremely low intent for any AOR aside from conference related AORs.
*   **Dynamic AOR Routing:** The system will not *solely* rely on the initial AOR identified in the call request. Instead:
    1.  Receive the initial AOR and a list of associated endpoints.
    2.  Ingest contextual data.
    3.  Calculate intent scores for *each* associated AOR.
    4.  Route the call to the endpoint associated with the *highest* intent score. If scores are equal, fall back to default AOR routing.
*   **User Override Mechanism:** Provide a mechanism for users to temporarily override the intent-based routing (e.g., long-pressing a contact to bypass scoring).
*   **AOR Weighting:**  Allow administrators (or users) to assign weights to different AOR types (e.g., "Work" AOR has a higher base weight than "Personal" AOR).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function routeCall(callRequest, contextualData, aorList, aorWeights):
  // Calculate intent scores for each AOR
  for each aor in aorList:
    intentScore = calculateIntentScore(aor, contextualData, aorWeights)
    aor.intentScore = intentScore

  // Find AOR with highest intent score
  highestScoringAOR = findMax(aorList, intentScore)

  //Check for user override
  if userOverrideActive(callRequest):
    endpoint = userOverrideEndpoint(callRequest)
  else:
    endpoint = highestScoringAOR.endpoint

  //Route call
  routeCallToEndpoint(callRequest, endpoint)

function calculateIntentScore(aor, contextualData, aorWeights):
  baseScore = aorWeights[aor.type] //e.g., Work = 0.7, Personal = 0.3

  // Apply contextual scoring (examples)
  if contextualData.inMeeting:
    if aor.type == "Work":
      baseScore += 0.5
    else:
      baseScore -= 0.2
  if contextualData.driving:
    if aor.type == "Car":
      baseScore += 0.8
    else:
      baseScore -= 0.5

  return baseScore
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved call routing accuracy and user experience.
*   Context-aware communication – calls reach the user at the most appropriate endpoint.
*   Reduced interruptions and increased productivity.
*   Adaptive communication - adjusts to changing user activities.
