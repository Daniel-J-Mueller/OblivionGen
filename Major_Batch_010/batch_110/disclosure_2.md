## Dynamic Character Relationship Mapping & Predictive Narrative Generation

**Concept:** Expand character identification beyond simple name/alias recognition to map *relationships* between characters, and then leverage this relationship data to predict narrative developments or generate entirely new narrative content.

**Specs:**

**1. Relationship Extraction Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw text (books, scripts, transcripts).
*   **Process:** Employ Named Entity Recognition (NER) enhanced with Relationship Extraction (RE). This isn’t just identifying ‘Character A’ and ‘Character B,’ but *how* they interact.  RE uses dependency parsing and semantic role labeling to identify verb phrases connecting entities. 
    *   Example: “John *gave* the book to Mary.”  RE identifies “John” (agent), “gave” (action), “Mary” (recipient).
*   **Output:** A graph database where nodes are characters and edges represent relationships (e.g., "father_of", "friend_of", "enemy_of", "works_for", "romantic_interest"). Edge weights reflect the strength/frequency of the relationship based on textual occurrences.  The graph should be versioned to track relationship changes across multiple related works (different editions of the same book, sequels, prequels).

**2. Relationship Significance Scoring:**

*   **Input:**  Character relationship graph.
*   **Process:**  Calculate a ‘relationship significance’ score for each edge. This incorporates:
    *   **Frequency:** How often the relationship is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Proximity:** How close characters are in narrative proximity (appear in the same scenes/paragraphs).
    *   **Sentiment:** Sentiment analysis of text relating to the relationship (positive/negative/neutral).
    *   **Centrality:**  A measure of how central the relationship is to the overall narrative (e.g., PageRank applied to the relationship graph).
*   **Output:** Weighted relationship graph.

**3. Predictive Narrative Engine:**

*   **Input:** Weighted relationship graph, existing narrative text (up to a certain point), configurable parameters (e.g., genre, desired tone).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Relationship Propagation:**  Identify strong relationships. Model ‘influence’ – how likely is Character A to affect Character B? This uses a probabilistic model based on relationship weight, influence score, and character personality profiles (derived from textual analysis).
    2.  **Conflict/Resolution Prediction:**  Identify potential conflicts or resolutions based on relationship dynamics.  If two characters have a strong negative relationship, predict a conflict. If they have a positive relationship, predict collaboration.  Incorporate rules based on genre conventions (e.g., in a mystery, predict a betrayal).
    3.  **Text Generation:** Use a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate text describing the predicted event.  Input:  Characters involved, relationship dynamics, predicted event, desired tone/style.
*   **Output:**  Generated narrative text.

**4.  Character Archetype Integration:**

*   **Process:**  Map identified characters to established archetypes (e.g., “hero”, “villain”, “mentor”, “trickster”). This provides additional context for predicting behavior and generating believable narratives.  Archetypes can influence relationship scoring and event prediction.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Narrative Engine):**

```
function generate_narrative(relationship_graph, existing_text, parameters):
  strong_relationships = find_strongest_relationships(relationship_graph)
  potential_events = generate_potential_events(strong_relationships, parameters)
  best_event = select_best_event(potential_events, existing_text)
  narrative_segment = generate_text(best_event)
  return narrative_segment
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Interactive Storytelling:**  Allow users to influence narrative direction by modifying relationship weights or suggesting new events.
*   **Content Creation:**  Generate plot outlines, character arcs, or entire stories.
*   **Character Analysis:**  Gain deeper insights into character motivations and relationships.
*   **"What If?" Scenarios:**  Explore alternative narrative paths.
