## Dynamic Scene Complexity Adjustment

**Concept:** A system that dynamically adjusts the complexity of rendered scene elements *before* service requests are sent, based on predicted network latency *and* client device processing capability, and prioritizes element rendering based on user focus (gaze tracking or input).

**Specifications:**

1.  **Scene Graph Analysis:** Incoming scene data (from a game, application, or content stream) is parsed into a scene graph representing objects, textures, and rendering instructions.

2.  **Complexity Levels:**  Each object in the scene graph is assigned multiple complexity levels. Level 0 = minimal detail (e.g., silhouette only), Level 1 = low poly with basic textures, Level 2 = medium poly with detailed textures, Level 3 = high poly with ray tracing/advanced effects.

3.  **Predictive Network Latency:** The client constantly monitors and *predicts* network latency to graphics services.  This prediction isn’t just current latency, but a short-term trend analysis (using moving averages, Kalman filters, or machine learning models).

4.  **Client Capability Assessment:** The client reports its processing capabilities (CPU/GPU performance, memory, screen resolution, etc.) to the server.

5.  **Dynamic LOD Selection:**  A ‘Complexity Manager’ on the client selects the appropriate complexity level for each object *before* a service request is sent. This selection is based on:
    *   Predicted network latency: Higher latency = lower complexity levels.
    *   Client capability: Lower capability = lower complexity levels.
    *   User Focus:  Objects within the user’s gaze or active interaction area receive higher priority and potentially higher complexity. Objects in peripheral vision receive lower priority.
    *   Object Importance: Some objects (e.g., player character) are *always* rendered at a minimum detail level, regardless of other factors.

6.  **Request Batching & Prioritization:** Complexity Manager batches service requests to reduce overhead, and prioritizes requests based on object importance & user focus.

7.  **Seamless Transition:** Implement techniques to smoothly transition between complexity levels. This could involve fading, blending, or animation to minimize visual pops.

8. **Service-Side Awareness:** The rendering service *knows* the possible complexity levels for each object and can efficiently handle requests for different LODs. It doesn’t need to generate full detail for every object.

**Pseudocode (Complexity Manager):**

```
function DetermineObjectComplexity(object, networkLatency, clientCapability, userFocus) {
  baseComplexity = 1; //Default to Level 1

  //Network Latency Adjustment
  if (networkLatency > thresholdHigh) {
    baseComplexity = 0;
  } else if (networkLatency > thresholdMedium) {
    baseComplexity = 1;
  }

  //Client Capability Adjustment
  if (clientCapability < thresholdLow) {
    baseComplexity = 0;
  } else if (clientCapability < thresholdMedium) {
    baseComplexity = 1;
  }

  //User Focus Adjustment
  if (object is in user's focus) {
    baseComplexity = min(3, baseComplexity + 1); //Increase up to Level 3
  }

  return baseComplexity;
}

function SendRenderRequest(object) {
  complexityLevel = DetermineObjectComplexity(object, predictedNetworkLatency, clientCapability, userFocus);
  request = CreateRenderRequest(object, complexityLevel);
  SendRequestToService(request);
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced network bandwidth usage
*   Improved frame rates on lower-end devices
*   More responsive gameplay even with fluctuating network conditions
*   Optimized rendering for better visual fidelity where the user is looking.
