## Modular Rack with Integrated Climate Control

**Concept:** Expand the rack system to include active climate control at the individual rack level, enabling temperature/humidity regulation for stored goods, particularly beneficial for sensitive items or those requiring specific environmental conditions.

**Specs:**

*   **Rack Structure:** Maintain the core structural principles of the existing rack – steel construction, stackability, offset front posts for flue ventilation. Base rack dimensions remain consistent with existing models.
*   **Decking Integration:** Replace perforated metal sheet decking with a multi-layer system:
    *   **Base Layer:** Structural support grid (steel or reinforced polymer).
    *   **Climate Control Layer:**  Array of micro-ducted air channels integrated within the support grid. These channels distribute conditioned air across the deck surface. Channel dimensions: 2cm x 2cm, spaced 10cm apart.
    *   **Surface Layer:** Removable, washable polymer grid – allows air circulation, provides support, and is easily cleaned.
*   **Climate Control Unit (CCU):** Each rack incorporates a self-contained CCU mounted on the rear uprights. 
    *   Dimensions: 30cm x 20cm x 15cm.
    *   Power: 120V AC, 5A max.
    *   Components: Mini-compressor, condenser, evaporator, humidity control module, air circulation fan, digital temperature/humidity sensors, wireless communication module (Bluetooth/WiFi).
    *   Operation: CCU draws ambient air, cools/humidifies/dehumidifies it, and distributes it through the micro-ducted decking system.  Each CCU operates independently, or can be networked for centralized control.
*   **Power Distribution:**
    *   Each rack has a dedicated power inlet.
    *   Optional power strip integrated into rear uprights for auxiliary devices (lighting, sensors).
*   **Control System:**
    *   Individual rack control panels with digital displays.
    *   Centralized management software via WiFi/Bluetooth.
    *   Remote monitoring and adjustment of temperature/humidity levels.
    *   Alerts for system failures or environmental deviations.
*   **Air Circulation:**
    *   Micro-ducted air distribution ensures even temperature and humidity across the deck surface.
    *   Flue ventilation in offset front posts maintains airflow around stacks.
    *   Optional auxiliary fans can be added for increased air circulation.
*   **Materials:**
    *   Steel for structural components.
    *   Reinforced polymer for decking layers.
    *   High-density insulation for CCU housing.
*   **Software Pseudo-Code (Simplified):**

// Rack Control Unit Software
Variables:
    targetTemperature (float)
    targetHumidity (float)
    currentTemperature (float)
    currentHumidity (float)

Function: UpdateSensors()
    Read temperature and humidity from sensors
    Store values in currentTemperature and currentHumidity

Function: ControlClimate()
    If currentTemperature > targetTemperature:
        Activate cooling system
    If currentTemperature < targetTemperature:
        Deactivate cooling system

    If currentHumidity > targetHumidity:
        Activate dehumidifier
    If currentHumidity < targetHumidity:
        Activate humidifier

Function: CommunicateData()
    Transmit currentTemperature, currentHumidity, and system status to central server

Loop:

    CommunicateData()
    Delay(5 seconds)
```

**Variations:**

*   **Solar Power Integration:** Equip CCUs with solar panels for off-grid operation.
*   **Gas Purge System:** Add a gas purge system for storing inert/sensitive materials.
*   **Automated Rack Movement:** Integrate rack movement with robotic systems for automated inventory management.
