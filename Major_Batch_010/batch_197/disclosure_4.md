## Employee Skill Graph & Predictive Re-skilling via Layered Ledgers

**Concept:** Expand the blockchain-based HR record to include a dynamically updated, cryptographically secured skill graph for each employee. This graph isn’t just *what* skills an employee has, but a probabilistic assessment of skill *proficiency* and potential skill *decay* over time, feeding into a predictive re-skilling system. The system uses a multi-layered ledger approach to handle sensitive data and different access levels.

**Ledger Layers:**

*   **Layer 1: Immutable Core (Permissioned Blockchain):** This layer stores core HR data (employment status, cost center, basic job title) as in the provided patent, along with cryptographically hashed representations of skill assessments. This ensures data integrity and provides an audit trail.
*   **Layer 2: Skill Assessment Ledger (Consortium Blockchain):**  A consortium blockchain managed by vetted third-party skill assessment providers (Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, internal training departments).  This ledger stores verifiable credentials and assessment results, linked to the employee’s hash in Layer 1.  Assessments are time-stamped and signed.
*   **Layer 3: Proficiency & Decay Ledger (Private/Encrypted Ledger):** This layer, accessible only by the employee, HR with proper authorization, and the AI model, stores a dynamic, probabilistic model of skill proficiency. This model utilizes assessment data from Layer 2, performance reviews (hashed and time-stamped on Layer 1), and potentially, data from project contributions (see below). It also models skill decay based on lack of use. Encryption keys are managed via secure hardware enclaves.

**Data Flow & Pseudocode:**

1.  **Skill Acquisition:** Employee completes a course/assessment.
    *   Assessment provider commits verifiable credential to Layer 2.
    *   Layer 2 transaction hash is linked to employee record in Layer 1.
2.  **Performance Monitoring:**  Data on project contributions (e.g., code commits, successful task completions, peer reviews) is gathered (optionally, with employee consent).
    *   This data is used to *update* the probabilistic skill model in Layer 3.  The updates are not stored directly, but reflected in the model’s parameters.
3.  **Skill Decay Calculation:**  A background process periodically evaluates skill usage based on project data and time since last assessment/training.
    *   The probabilistic skill model in Layer 3 is adjusted to reflect decay.
4.  **Predictive Re-skilling:** An AI model analyzes the skill graph for each employee (Layer 3) and predicts potential skill gaps based on organizational needs and industry trends.
    *   The AI generates personalized re-skilling recommendations.
    *   These recommendations are presented to the employee and their manager.
5.  **Skill Validation:** Upon completion of a re-skilling activity, a new assessment is conducted, updating Layer 2 and Layer 3.

**Pseudocode for Skill Decay Calculation:**

```
function calculateSkillDecay(skill, lastUsedDate, decayRate):
  daysSinceLastUsed = currentDate() - lastUsedDate
  decayFactor = exponentialDecay(daysSinceLastUsed, decayRate)
  currentProficiency = getProficiency(skill)
  newProficiency = currentProficiency * decayFactor
  return newProficiency

function exponentialDecay(days, rate):
  return exp(-rate * days)
```

**System Components:**

*   **Skill Graph Service:** Manages the probabilistic skill model (Layer 3).
*   **Ledger Integration Service:**  Handles communication with the different blockchain layers.
*   **AI Re-skilling Engine:**  Analyzes skill graphs and generates recommendations.
*   **Secure Enclave Manager:**  Manages encryption keys for Layer 3.

**Benefits:**

*   **Proactive Skill Management:** Enables organizations to anticipate and address skill gaps before they impact performance.
*   **Personalized Learning:** Delivers targeted re-skilling recommendations based on individual needs and organizational goals.
*   **Enhanced Data Integrity:** Leverages blockchain to ensure the authenticity and reliability of skill data.
*   **Employee Empowerment:** Gives employees more control over their skill development and career paths.
