## Predictive Maintenance with Dynamic Lasagna Plot Layer Selection & Anomaly Injection

**Concept:** Enhance the lasagna plot methodology by dynamically selecting layers based on real-time sensor data relevance *and* intentionally injecting synthetic anomalies to stress-test prediction models. This aims to improve both prediction accuracy and robustness against unforeseen operational conditions.

**Specs:**

**I. Dynamic Layer Selection Module:**

*   **Input:** Multivariate time series data from various sensors (temperature, pressure, vibration, etc.).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Relevance Scoring:**  Implement a rolling correlation analysis between each time series and a ‘health indicator’ derived from a primary sensor (e.g., motor current). Assign a relevance score to each time series based on this correlation.
    2.  **Layer Prioritization:**  Prioritize lasagna plot layers based on relevance scores.  Layers representing highly relevant time series are given higher weighting in the visualization and subsequent model processing.
    3.  **Adaptive Layer Count:** Dynamically adjust the number of lasagna plot layers presented to the image processing model. Low-relevance data may be excluded to reduce noise.
*   **Output:** Ranked list of time series data for lasagna plot layer creation.

**II. Synthetic Anomaly Injection Module:**

*   **Input:**  Current multivariate time series data, and a library of pre-defined anomaly profiles (e.g., sudden temperature spike, gradual pressure drop, vibration frequency shift).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Anomaly Profile Selection:** Select anomaly profiles based on historical failure modes or simulated scenarios.
    2.  **Injection Point Determination:** Randomly select data points within the time series to inject the anomaly. Employ a probability distribution that favors regions where anomalies are more likely to occur (e.g., during startup/shutdown).
    3.  **Anomaly Amplitude Scaling:**  Scale the amplitude of the injected anomaly based on the expected sensor range and noise levels.
    4.  **Data Augmentation:**  Create multiple augmented datasets with different anomaly injections to increase the diversity of training data.
*   **Output:** Augmented multivariate time series data with synthetic anomalies.

**III. Integrated System Architecture:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Real-time sensor data is fed into the Dynamic Layer Selection Module.
2.  **Layer Prioritization & Creation:** The module prioritizes and creates lasagna plot layers.
3.  **Anomaly Augmentation:** The Synthetic Anomaly Injection Module augments the training and validation datasets.
4.  **Image Generation:** The prioritized layers are combined to form the lasagna plot image.
5.  **Model Training:** An image processing model (e.g., CNN, Transformer) is trained on the augmented dataset.
6.  **Prediction:** The trained model processes the lasagna plot image to predict potential failures.
7.  **Feedback Loop:**  Prediction accuracy is monitored, and the anomaly injection parameters are adjusted to optimize model performance.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Injection):**

```python
def inject_anomaly(time_series, anomaly_profile, injection_probability):
  """
  Injects a synthetic anomaly into a time series.
  """
  augmented_series = time_series.copy()
  for i in range(len(augmented_series)):
    if random.random() < injection_probability:
      # Apply anomaly profile to a small segment of the time series
      segment_length = len(anomaly_profile)
      start_index = max(0, i - segment_length // 2)
      end_index = min(len(augmented_series), i + segment_length // 2)
      augmented_series[start_index:end_index] += anomaly_profile[0:end_index - start_index]
  return augmented_series
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Use GANs to create more realistic and diverse synthetic anomalies.
*   **Active Learning:**  Select the most informative data points for anomaly injection based on model uncertainty.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):**  Use XAI techniques to understand which layers and features of the lasagna plot are most important for prediction.
