## Dynamic Order Splitting & Predictive Bottleneck Resolution

**Concept:** Extend the multi-channel order management system to *proactively* split orders *within* the aggregation queue based on predicted fulfillment bottlenecks and dynamically route those split portions to alternate delivery channels or merchant locations. This goes beyond simply selecting a delivery channel *after* aggregation; it modifies the order itself *before* fulfillment begins.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** “Bottleneck Prediction Engine” - a machine learning module integrated into the aggregation queue.
*   **Input:** Real-time data streams:
    *   Historical fulfillment times per merchant/item combination.
    *   Current order volume per merchant.
    *   Real-time delivery channel capacity (drivers available, vehicle capacity, estimated travel times).
    *   Weather data (impacts delivery times).
    *   Inventory levels at each merchant location.
*   **Process:**
    1.  As an order enters the aggregation queue, the Bottleneck Prediction Engine analyzes the order contents and predicts potential bottlenecks in fulfillment (e.g., a specific item is low in stock at the primary merchant, a particular merchant is experiencing unusually high order volume).
    2.  If a bottleneck is predicted with a confidence level above a threshold, the system proposes an order split.
    3.  The split divides the order into sub-orders, each containing items that can be fulfilled without encountering the predicted bottleneck. Sub-orders are strategically assigned to alternate merchant locations (if available and the items are carried there) or flagged for separate delivery via a different channel.
    4.  The system presents the proposed split and associated cost/time trade-offs (e.g., slightly higher delivery fee for faster delivery via a premium channel) to a user (merchant or customer) for approval. Alternatively, based on pre-defined rules, the split can be enacted automatically.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `Order` object: Contains list of `OrderItem`s.
    *   `OrderItem` object: Contains item ID, quantity, fulfillment location, delivery channel.
    *   `BottleneckPrediction` object: Contains predicted bottleneck, severity, and recommended split strategy (list of `OrderItem`s to be split).
*   **Pseudocode (Order Processing Flow):**

```
function processOrder(order):
  orderQueue.add(order)
  bottleneckPrediction = BottleneckPredictionEngine.predict(order)

  if bottleneckPrediction.severity > threshold:
    splitOrder = createSplitOrder(order, bottleneckPrediction.splitStrategy)
    presentSplitOrderToUser(splitOrder) // or automatically enact

    if user approves split:
      processSplitOrder(splitOrder)
    else:
      // Handle case where user rejects split
      logRejection(order)
  else:
    processOrder(order)
```

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/orders/split/predict` – Takes an order as input and returns a bottleneck prediction.
    *   `/orders/split/approve` – Approves a proposed order split.
    *   `/orders/split/reject` – Rejects a proposed order split.

*   **Delivery Channel Integration:**
    *   The system must integrate with various delivery channels to dynamically assess capacity and estimated travel times.
    *   Real-time API calls to delivery channel providers will be used to obtain this information.
*   **Reporting and Analytics:**
    *   Track the frequency of order splits, the reasons for splits, and the impact on fulfillment times and customer satisfaction.
    *   Use this data to refine the Bottleneck Prediction Engine and optimize the order splitting strategy.
