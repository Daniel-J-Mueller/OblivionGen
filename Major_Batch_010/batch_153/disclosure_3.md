## Layered Image Dependency Graph & Predictive Caching

**System Specifications:**

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple layer caching to a dependency-aware predictive caching system. Instead of just caching layers accessed, predict future layer needs based on user selection patterns and a defined dependency graph.

**1. Dependency Graph Construction:**

*   **Data Source:** Analyze historical user selection data (as already collected in the patent) and metadata associated with each machine image layer.  Metadata must include explicit dependencies - what other layers *must* be present for this layer to function correctly.
*   **Graph Structure:** Represent layer dependencies as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Nodes are machine image layers, edges represent "depends on" relationships.
*   **Automated Discovery:** Implement an algorithm to automatically infer dependencies when metadata is incomplete. This could involve analyzing the layer content itself (file system structure, libraries, etc.) or observing runtime behavior.

**2. Predictive Caching Algorithm:**

*   **User Session Tracking:** Monitor user selections *during* a session.
*   **Graph Traversal:**  After each selection, traverse the dependency graph *forward* from the selected layer. Identify layers that are likely to be needed next.
*   **Probability Weighting:** Assign probability weights to each predicted layer based on:
    *   **Historical Frequency:** How often is this layer selected after the current one?
    *   **Dependency Distance:**  Layers closer to the current one in the graph have higher probability.
    *   **User Profile:** Consider the user's past selections to personalize predictions.
*   **Prefetching:**  Prefetch the highest-probability layers to the local cache *before* the user explicitly requests them. 
*   **Cache Eviction:**  Implement a Least Recently/Least Likely Used (LRU/LLU) eviction policy that considers both recency *and* predicted future usage.

**3. Layer Composition & Virtualization Enhancement:**

*   **Dynamic Layer Assembly:** The system should be able to dynamically assemble machine images from the cached layers, creating a virtual machine on demand.
*   **Layer Diffing & Versioning:**  Implement layer diffing to minimize storage space and bandwidth usage.  Store only the differences between versions of a layer.
*   **“Image Snapshots” as Graph Subsets:**  Allow users to define "image snapshots" as subsets of the dependency graph.  This enables quick creation of pre-configured virtual machines.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Logic):**

```
function prefetch_layers(user_selection, user_session_data):
  graph = dependency_graph()
  dependent_layers = graph.get_dependent_layers(user_selection)

  for layer in dependent_layers:
    probability = calculate_probability(layer, user_session_data)
    if probability > threshold:
      if not layer.is_cached():
        fetch_and_cache(layer)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-bandwidth network connection
*   Large-capacity, fast storage (SSD or NVMe)
*   In-memory graph database (e.g., Neo4j)
*   Machine virtualization platform (e.g., KVM, Xen)
*   Real-time analytics engine for user session tracking.
