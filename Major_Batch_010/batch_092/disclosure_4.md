## Adaptive Notification Environments - 'Chameleon'

**Concept:** Extend the notification system to dynamically alter the *environment* around the user in response to notifications, rather than just presenting information *to* the user. This shifts from a passive reception model to an active, immersive experience.

**Specs:**

1.  **Environmental Sensor Integration:**
    *   System integrates with a network of environmental sensors (smart lighting, smart thermostats, smart speakers, wearable haptics, aroma diffusers, motorized shades).
    *   Sensors report current environmental state (temperature, brightness, audio levels, scent, etc.).
2.  **Notification-Environment Mapping:**
    *   A 'Notification-Environment Profile' (NEP) database. Each NEP associates:
        *   Notification Type (e.g., calendar event, critical alert, social media update).
        *   Environmental Adjustment Rules (EAR). EARs define how sensor values should be modified. Examples:
            *   "Calendar Event - Meeting Start": Dim lights to 30%, set thermostat to 22C, play subtle focus music.
            *   "Critical Alert - System Failure": Flash red light, activate a distinct haptic pattern on the user’s wrist, emit a specific audible tone.
            *   "Social Media Update - Friend's Birthday": Briefly display a festive color scheme via smart lighting, play a short celebratory jingle.
    *   EARs utilize weighted algorithms to modulate environmental factors gradually, preventing jarring transitions.
3.  **User Customization & Learning:**
    *   A 'NEP Editor' UI allows users to create, modify, and prioritize NEPs.
    *   The system employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model. It observes user reactions (e.g., dismissing notifications quickly, manually adjusting settings) to refine EARs over time. This personalization optimizes the environment for the user's preferences.
4.  **Contextual Awareness:**
    *   System integrates with location services, time of day, and user activity (detected via wearables or device usage) to adjust notification-environment responses.
    *   Example: A "Meeting Start" NEP triggers a different response at home vs. in a public space.
5.  **'Mood' Presets:**
    *   Users can select pre-defined 'mood' presets (e.g., 'Focus', 'Relax', 'Energize'). These presets adjust both notification delivery and environmental settings.

**Pseudocode (RL Adaptation):**

```
// On receiving a notification of type 'notificationType'
environmentProfile = getEnvironmentProfile(notificationType)

// Current environmental state:
currentTemp = getTemperature()
currentBrightness = getBrightness()
currentAudioLevel = getAudioLevel()

// Proposed environmental adjustments:
newTemp = currentTemp + environmentProfile.tempAdjustment
newBrightness = currentBrightness + environmentProfile.brightnessAdjustment
newAudioLevel = currentAudioLevel + environmentProfile.audioAdjustment

// Apply adjustments (smooth transition)
setTemperature(newTemp)
setBrightness(newBrightness)
setAudioLevel(newAudioLevel)

// User Feedback (reward/penalty)
if (userDismissedNotificationQuickly) {
    reward = -1 // Penalty – User disliked the environment
} else {
    reward = 1 // Reward – User found the environment acceptable
}

// Update RL model with reward
updateRLModel(notificationType, reward)
```

**Hardware Dependencies:**

*   Networked Smart Home Devices (Lighting, Thermostats, Speakers, etc.).
*   Wearable Devices (for Haptic Feedback and Activity Tracking).
*   High-bandwidth Network Connection.
