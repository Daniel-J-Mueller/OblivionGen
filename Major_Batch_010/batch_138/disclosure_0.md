## Dynamic Acoustic Zoning for Enhanced Privacy

**Concept:** Leveraging the core idea of detecting speech/non-speech, this system goes beyond ending a call. It dynamically creates 'acoustic zones' within a space to enhance privacy *during* a call, rather than simply terminating it. Imagine a conference room where multiple conversations are happening concurrently. This system actively shapes the audio environment to isolate each conversation.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 8 mics) integrated into each device (phone, speakerphone, dedicated room unit). Spatial audio processing capable.
    *   Dedicated processing unit (integrated into device or cloud-based) for real-time audio analysis and beamforming.
    *   Optional: Dedicated low-power speaker array for localized audio masking (see masking functionality below).

*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Advanced Source Localization:**  Algorithm identifies the direction and distance of each speaking voice in the environment.  Utilizes Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and beamforming techniques. Accuracy target:  < 5 degrees for directional accuracy, < 0.5m for distance.
    *   **Dynamic Acoustic Zone Creation:** Software creates virtual 'acoustic zones' around each participant. Zones are defined by a spherical radius (adjustable based on room size and desired privacy level - default 1.5m).
    *   **Adaptive Beamforming:** Microphones dynamically adjust their focus (beamforming) to amplify the audio within each zone and suppress audio from outside the zone. Prioritization algorithm: Focus on the *active* speaker within a zone, dynamically adjusting based on voice activity detection.
    *   **Non-Speech Activity Mapping:** Detects and maps non-speech sounds (typing, paper rustling, etc.) and intelligently filters them out or minimizes their impact on the audio within each zone.  Classification algorithm: Differentiate between innocuous sounds and potential disruptions (e.g., door slamming).
    *   **Privacy Masking (Optional):** If significant background noise persists, the system generates localized masking sounds (pink noise, ambient sounds) *within* the zones to further enhance privacy.  Sound generation algorithm: Adapt masking sound intensity to noise level.
    *   **Zone Merging/Splitting:**  Algorithm automatically merges or splits zones based on proximity of speakers and detected conversation patterns.
    *   **User Control:**  User interface (app/device settings) to adjust zone size, privacy level (masking intensity), and manually override zone assignments.

*   **Pseudocode (Zone Assignment & Beamforming):**

```
// Initialization
Define room dimensions
Initialize microphone array
Define default zone radius

// During Call:
For each device (participant):
    Detect voice activity
    If voice activity detected:
        Locate source of voice (spatial audio processing)
        Create/Update zone around source location
        Set zone radius based on user preference or room size

    For each microphone:
        Calculate beamforming weights to focus on active zone
        Apply beamforming weights to microphone input
        Suppress audio from outside active zones

    If background noise exceeds threshold:
        Generate localized masking sound within zone
        Adjust masking sound intensity based on noise level
```

*   **Potential Use Cases:** Open-plan offices, conference rooms, shared workspaces, telehealth consultations, secure communication environments.

*   **Novelty:**  Existing solutions focus on noise cancellation or call termination. This actively *shapes* the audio environment *during* a call to enhance privacy and clarity. It's a proactive approach rather than a reactive one. The dynamic zone creation and adaptive beamforming are key differentiators.
