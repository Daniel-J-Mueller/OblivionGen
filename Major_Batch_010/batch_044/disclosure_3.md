## Adaptive Beamforming with Echo Return Loss Enhancement Mapping

**Concept:** Utilize the echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) metric – already being calculated in the provided patent – not just for delay estimation, but as a key input into a dynamic beamforming algorithm for the microphone array. The system will build a spatial map of ERLE values, identifying areas with high echo potential and dynamically adjusting the beamforming weights to suppress sound from those regions.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum of four microphones, arranged in a circular or rectangular pattern. High sensitivity, low noise characteristics preferred.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated DSP or FPGA with sufficient processing power to handle real-time beamforming and ERLE calculations.
*   **ERLE Mapping Module:**
    *   Continuously performs AEC with varying delay parameters (as per the original patent) to determine ERLE for *multiple* spatial locations. This is achieved by slightly altering the assumed sound source direction for each delay parameter sweep.
    *   Generates a 2D or 3D ERLE map, representing the echo potential across the listening environment. Resolution adjustable based on processing power. Map updated continuously (e.g., 10-20 Hz).
*   **Dynamic Beamforming Module:**
    *   Utilizes the ERLE map to dynamically adjust the weights applied to each microphone in the array.
    *   Higher negative weights are applied to microphones receiving sound from areas with low ERLE (high echo potential).
    *   Beamforming algorithm: Constrained Least Squares (CLS) or Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) preferred, for adaptability and noise suppression.
    *   Regularization parameter adjustable to balance noise reduction and distortion.
*   **Calibration Module:**
    *   Initial calibration phase to account for microphone variations and room acoustics.
    *   Automated calibration using a known sound source and impulse response measurements.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Beamforming Module):**

```
// Input: ERLE Map (2D array), Microphone Signal Array, Sound Source Direction Estimate

function applyDynamicBeamforming(erleMap, micSignals, sourceDirection) {

  numMics = length(micSignals);
  weights = array of size numMics;

  for i = 0 to numMics - 1 {
    // Calculate weight based on ERLE in the direction of the ith microphone
    // Adjust weight based on distance and angle to target source.

    // The below is a simplification, and could be any weighting function.
    weight = 1.0 - (erleMap[i][direction_angle] * scaling_factor); //Scale ERLE to a weight.
    weights[i] = weight;
  }

  // Normalize weights.
  sum_weights = sum(weights);
  weights = weights / sum_weights;

  // Apply weights to microphone signals.
  outputSignal = 0;
  for i = 0 to numMics - 1 {
    outputSignal += micSignals[i] * weights[i];
  }

  return outputSignal;
}
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Moving Sound Source Tracking:** Integrate a sound source localization algorithm to track moving sound sources and dynamically adjust the beamforming weights accordingly.
*   **Adaptive Scaling Factor:** Implement an algorithm that dynamically adjusts the scaling factor applied to the ERLE values based on the overall noise level and desired level of echo suppression.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Train a machine learning model to predict the optimal beamforming weights based on the ERLE map and other relevant features (e.g., room acoustics, noise level).
