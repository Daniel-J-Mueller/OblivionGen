**Multi-Modal Dialogue State Tracking with Emotional Valence Anchoring**

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This system extends multi-assistant NLP by integrating real-time emotional state analysis of the user, not just from speech *content*, but from *prosodic features* and, crucially, *visual cues* (if available via camera input).  It then *anchors* the dialogue state not solely on intent, but on an evolving ‘emotional valence’ – a score representing the user’s perceived emotional state (positive, negative, neutral). This impacts assistant selection *and* response generation.

**II. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard microphone array for speech capture.
*   Optional: Camera (RGB or RGB-D) for facial expression and body language analysis.
*   Processing unit capable of running speech recognition, NLP, computer vision (if applicable), and emotional analysis models.

**III. Software Components:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Input Fusion Module:** This module receives audio and video (optional) streams.  Audio undergoes Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Video undergoes facial expression recognition (FER) and potentially body pose estimation.
2.  **Emotional Valence Estimator:** This module fuses the outputs of ASR and FER (and pose estimation) to produce a continuous score representing the user’s emotional valence.  This is *not* simply sentiment analysis (positive/negative), but a more granular score (e.g., -1 to +1).  Machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks, transformers) will be trained on multi-modal datasets labeled with emotional valence.
3.  **Dynamic Assistant Selector:**  This is the core innovation.  The system maintains a profile for each NLP assistant, including a ‘personality’ vector.  This vector represents the assistant’s perceived emotional style (e.g., empathetic, factual, playful). The selector calculates a ‘compatibility score’ between the user's current emotional valence and each assistant’s personality vector. The assistant with the highest compatibility is selected.  The weighting between valence and intent will be adjustable.
4.  **Response Generation Module:** This module leverages the selected assistant’s personality to generate responses.  It can dynamically adjust the tone, language style, and content of the response to align with both the user’s emotional state *and* the assistant’s personality.
5.  **Dialogue State Tracker:**  Maintains a history of user inputs, assistant responses, and emotional valence scores. This allows the system to adapt to evolving emotional states over time.

**IV. Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
assistant_profiles = {assistant1: {personality: [empathy, factual, playfulness], voice: "voice1"},
                      assistant2: {personality: [factual, efficiency, neutrality], voice: "voice2"}}
user_emotional_valence = 0 // Initial value

// Main loop
while (true) {
  audio_input = capture_audio()
  video_input = capture_video() // Optional

  text_input = speech_to_text(audio_input)

  emotional_valence = estimate_emotional_valence(text_input, video_input)

  //Update user emotional valence, smoothing with previous values
  user_emotional_valence = 0.7 * user_emotional_valence + 0.3 * emotional_valence

  best_assistant = select_best_assistant(user_emotional_valence, assistant_profiles)

  intent = extract_intent(text_input)

  response = generate_response(intent, best_assistant)

  text_to_speech(response, best_assistant.voice)

  output_audio()
}
```

**V. Novelty:**

This differs from existing multi-assistant systems by proactively incorporating emotional state as a first-class citizen in assistant selection *and* response generation.  The system doesn’t just respond to *what* the user says, but *how* they are feeling. This creates a more nuanced and engaging user experience. The ‘emotional valence anchoring’ concept goes beyond simple sentiment analysis by providing a continuous, dynamic representation of the user’s emotional state.  The dynamic assistant selection based on emotional compatibility is a key innovation.
