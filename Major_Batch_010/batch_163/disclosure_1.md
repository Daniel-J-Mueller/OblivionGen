## Dynamic Key Attestation with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Enhance trust evaluation beyond static key versioning by incorporating behavioral biometrics of the device *during* the secure boot process. This aims to detect compromised devices even if they present valid, up-to-date keys.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Secure Element (SE):** Dedicated hardware for storing the root of trust (first public key as per the patent) and executing the attestation process.
*   **Behavioral Sensor Suite:**
    *   **Microphone:** Captures audio signals for voiceprint/ambient sound analysis.
    *   **Accelerometer/Gyroscope:** Measures device motion and orientation.
    *   **Touchscreen Sensor (Capacitive/Resistive):** Captures touch dynamics – pressure, speed, area, and patterns.
    *   **Optional: Camera:** For facial recognition (only enabled during initial device setup/recovery – privacy conscious design).
*   **Real-Time Clock (RTC):**  Provides accurate time stamps for behavioral data.
*   **Dedicated DMA Controller:**  For high-speed data transfer from sensors to the SE, minimizing CPU overhead.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Secure Bootloader:** Initial boot code responsible for loading and verifying the OS kernel. Modified to incorporate attestation.
*   **Behavioral Profiling Engine (within SE):**
    *   **Data Acquisition Module:** Collects data from the Behavioral Sensor Suite.
    *   **Feature Extraction Module:** Extracts relevant features (e.g., voiceprint frequencies, motion patterns, touch pressure variance, touch speed) from raw sensor data.
    *   **Enrollment Module:** Creates a baseline behavioral profile during device manufacturing/initial setup. This profile is encrypted and stored within the SE.  Uses machine learning techniques to build a robust model.
    *   **Attestation Module:**  During each boot:
        1.  Collects behavioral data.
        2.  Extracts features.
        3.  Compares the current behavioral profile with the enrolled baseline.  Uses a similarity score.
        4.  Combines the similarity score with the key version check (as described in the patent).
        5.  Determines a final trust score.
*   **Remote Attestation Server (RAS):**  (Optional) Used for continuous monitoring and revocation of compromised devices.

**III. Process Flow:**

1.  **Enrollment Phase (Factory/Initial Setup):**  Device is prompted to perform a series of actions (e.g., speak a phrase, move the device in specific patterns, use the touchscreen).  The Behavioral Profiling Engine captures the data and creates a baseline profile, encrypted with a key derived from the root of trust.
2.  **Secure Boot Attestation:**
    1.  Secure Bootloader loads.
    2.  Behavioral Sensor Suite is activated.
    3.  Behavioral Profiling Engine captures data.
    4.  Feature extraction and comparison with the enrolled profile are performed.
    5.  Key version check (as per the patent) is performed concurrently.
    6.  Trust score is calculated: `Trust Score =  (Key Version Weight * Key Version Score) + (Behavioral Weight * Behavioral Score)` (Weights are configurable).
    7.  If the Trust Score exceeds a threshold:
        *   The device is considered trusted, and the boot process continues.
    8.  If the Trust Score falls below the threshold:
        *   The device enters a recovery mode.  Optionally, an alert is sent to the RAS.

**IV.  Pseudocode (Attestation Module):**

```
function AttestDevice():
    keyVersionScore = CheckKeyVersion() // From the original patent logic
    behavioralScore = CaptureAndCompareBehavioralData()

    trustScore = (keyVersionWeight * keyVersionScore) + (behavioralWeight * behavioralScore)

    if trustScore > trustThreshold:
        return Trusted
    else:
        EnterRecoveryMode()
        ReportCompromise()
        return Untrusted
```

**V.  Security Considerations:**

*   **Data Encryption:**  All behavioral data stored within the SE must be encrypted.
*   **Tamper Resistance:** The SE must be physically tamper-resistant to prevent attackers from extracting the enrolled profile.
*   **Spoofing Protection:** Implement techniques to detect and prevent spoofing of behavioral biometrics (e.g., replay attacks).
*   **Privacy:**  Minimize the amount of personal data collected and stored. Provide users with control over their privacy settings.
