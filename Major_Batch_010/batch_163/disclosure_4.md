## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Integration

**Concept:** Extend the visual depth cues described in the patent by integrating localized haptic feedback delivered through a smart surface (display or adjacent bezel). This creates a more compelling and intuitive user interface, particularly for selecting and interacting with interface elements.

**Specs:**

*   **Surface Requirements:** A display or adjacent bezel capable of delivering localized, variable-intensity haptic feedback (e.g., ultrasonic transducers, micro-actuators, electroactive polymers). Resolution of at least 1cm spacing between haptic feedback points.
*   **Tracking System:** Integration with the existing camera and sensor suite to accurately determine user finger/hand position relative to the display surface.  Sub-millimeter accuracy is preferred for precise feedback.
*   **Haptic Mapping Algorithm:** A software algorithm that maps the visual depth of interface elements to corresponding haptic feedback intensity.  
    *   Selected elements: Deliver a distinct ‘bump’ or ‘click’ haptic sensation. Intensity scales with the degree to which the element appears 'closer' visually.
    *   Unselected elements: Deliver a subtle 'texture' or 'resistance' sensation.  Intensity scales inversely with visual depth; elements appearing further away feel smoother.
    *   Transition Effects: Smooth transitions between haptic sensations as the user moves their focus between elements.
*   **Pseudocode (Haptic Mapping):**

```
function generateHapticFeedback(element, userPosition, visualDepth):
  if (element is selected):
    hapticIntensity = visualDepth * scalingFactor // Scaling factor adjusts overall intensity
    hapticType = "bump"
  else:
    hapticIntensity = 1 - visualDepth //Invert depth for resistance
    hapticType = "texture"

  //Clamp intensity to 0-1 range
  hapticIntensity = constrain(hapticIntensity, 0, 1)

  //Convert intensity to actuator signal (specific to hardware)
  actuatorSignal = convertIntensityToSignal(hapticIntensity)

  //Send signal to haptic actuators at element's location
  sendHapticSignal(element.x, element.y, actuatorSignal, hapticType)
end function
```

*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Adapt haptic feedback based on user preferences and environmental factors (e.g., ambient noise, lighting conditions).
*   **Accessibility Mode:** Offer adjustable haptic feedback intensity and patterns for users with visual or tactile impairments.
*   **Application Integration:** Provide an API for developers to customize haptic feedback for specific applications and interface elements.
