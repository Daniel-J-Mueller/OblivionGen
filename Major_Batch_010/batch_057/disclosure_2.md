## Dynamic Trajectory Envelope Morphing via Bio-Inspired Neural Network

**Concept:** The current patent focuses on pre-defined, scalable trajectory envelopes based on object *type*. This design proposes a system that dynamically *morphs* these envelopes in real-time based on observed, individual object *behavior*, using a bio-inspired neural network. Instead of relying solely on object classification, the system learns and predicts individual object trajectories, adapting the safety envelope accordingly.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sensor Suite Enhancement:** Expand the sensor suite beyond basic detection to include high-resolution tracking data (Doppler radar, multiple camera angles for robust tracking, potentially lidar). This data will feed the neural network.
2.  **Neural Network Architecture:** Implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. LSTM is crucial for processing sequential data (object movement over time) and retaining relevant information for accurate prediction.
    *   **Input Layer:** Receives processed sensor data: position, velocity, acceleration, angular velocity, and rate of change of these parameters.
    *   **Hidden Layers:** Multiple LSTM layers to capture complex temporal dependencies.
    *   **Output Layer:** Predicts a probability distribution over possible future trajectories.  The output isn't a single path, but a "cone" of probable locations weighted by probability.
3.  **Dynamic Envelope Generation:**
    *   The probability distribution from the neural network is used to construct the trajectory envelope in real-time. Higher probability regions form a tighter, more conservative envelope. Lower probability regions contribute to a broader, more relaxed envelope.
    *   Instead of *isoprobability lines*, use *isosurfaces* to represent the probability distribution in 3D space, generating a dynamically morphing volume.
4.  **Learning & Adaptation:**
    *   The neural network is trained using a dataset of real-world object movements.
    *   Implement a reinforcement learning component.  The system learns from its own interactions with the environment. If a near-miss occurs, the network adjusts its weights to improve prediction accuracy.
    *   Federated learning: Each UAV contributes learned data without sharing raw sensor data, improving the overall model while maintaining privacy.
5.  **UAV Integration:**
    *   A dedicated processing unit (GPU or specialized AI accelerator) onboard the UAV to handle the computationally intensive neural network processing.
    *   Integration with the existing flight management system to incorporate the dynamic trajectory envelope into path planning and collision avoidance algorithms.
6.  **Pseudocode (Flight Management Integration):**

```
function update_flight_plan(current_plan, dynamic_envelope):
  intersection = check_intersection(current_plan, dynamic_envelope)

  if intersection:
    # Calculate a 'cost' for deviations based on envelope proximity.
    deviation_cost = calculate_deviation_cost(current_plan, dynamic_envelope)

    # Adjust flight plan using an optimization algorithm (e.g., A*, RRT)
    # minimizing deviation cost while respecting UAV constraints.
    new_plan = optimize_path(current_plan, deviation_cost)
    return new_plan
  else:
    return current_plan
```

7.  **Scalability:**
    *   Implement a hierarchical system.  Lower-level processing onboard each UAV handles individual object tracking and prediction.  Higher-level ground stations aggregate data and refine the global model.
    *   Use distributed computing techniques to handle the large amounts of data generated by multiple UAVs.
