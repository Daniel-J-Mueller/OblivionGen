## Specimen Tube with Integrated Microfluidic Partitioning

**Concept:** A specimen tube designed to passively partition a fluid sample into multiple, discrete microfluidic chambers for multiplexed analysis, eliminating the need for external pipetting or manipulation.

**Specifications:**

*   **Tube Body:** Standard cylindrical shape, compatible with existing automated handling systems. Material: Cyclic Olefin Copolymer (COC) or similar biocompatible, optically clear polymer.
*   **Internal Structure:** Multiple (N=4-16, configurable) radial microchannels extending from the central sample holding space towards the tube's outer wall. These channels are precision-molded into the tube body.
*   **Microfluidic Chambers:** Each radial channel terminates in a sealed microfluidic chamber formed by a secondary, precision-molded feature in the tube wall. Chamber volume: 50-500 nL, configurable.
*   **Partitioning Mechanism:** Capillary action and fluid dynamics are leveraged to passively distribute sample into the microfluidic chambers upon tube filling. Microchannel geometry (width, depth, angle) is optimized to ensure even distribution.
*   **Optical Clarity:** Tube wall and microfluidic chambers are designed for high optical transmission across a broad spectrum (UV-Vis, Fluorescence) for spectroscopic analysis.
*   **Fluidic Barriers:** Microscopic barriers are integrated into the chamber design to prevent cross-contamination between chambers.
*   **Luminescent Tracer Integration:** Microfluidic chambers are pre-filled with a quantifiable, luminescent tracer. Tracer concentration is proportional to sample volume within the chamber. Allows for automated volume verification.
*   **External Reading Features:** External features (grooves, markings) on the tube body correspond to specific chamber locations, facilitating robotic access for reading.
*   **Foot Design Integration:** Modified foot design incorporating a magnetic element. When placed on a magnetic base, the base activates a micro-heater embedded in each chamber. Heater temperature is regulated for specific reactions (e.g. PCR, ELISA)
*   **Manufacturing:** Two-shot injection molding process. First shot creates the tube body. Second shot creates the internal microfluidic structure.
*   **Multi-Start Thread Modification:** The multi-start thread is enhanced with micro-ridges. These ridges interface with a sensor on the automated capping machine. Machine is able to verify thread engagement to prevent contamination.

**Pseudocode for fluid distribution:**

```
function distribute_sample(sample_volume, num_chambers)
{
  chamber_volume = sample_volume / num_chambers;
  for (i = 0; i < num_chambers; i++)
  {
    //Fluid naturally flows into microchannel due to capillary action
    //Microchannel dimensions determine flow rate and final chamber volume
    flow_rate = calculate_flow_rate(microchannel_dimensions);
    fill_chamber(chamber_volume, flow_rate);
  }
}

function calculate_flow_rate(microchannel_dimensions)
{
  //Equation accounts for channel width, depth, and fluid viscosity
  flow_rate = (channel_width * channel_depth) / fluid_viscosity;
  return flow_rate;
}

function fill_chamber(chamber_volume, flow_rate)
{
  //Monitor chamber fill level via integrated optical sensor
  while (chamber_fill_level < chamber_volume)
  {
    //Maintain constant flow rate
    adjust_flow(flow_rate);
  }
}
