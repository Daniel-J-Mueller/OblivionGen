## Dynamic Data Masking with Generative Adversarial Networks

**Specification:** A system for real-time, context-aware data masking utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce synthetic data that preserves utility for analysis while protecting sensitive information.

**Core Concept:** Instead of static or rule-based masking, this system learns the distribution of data and generates plausible, synthetic replacements for sensitive fields. The level of masking adapts based on the requesting userâ€™s permissions and the intended use of the data.

**Components:**

*   **Data Profiler:** Analyzes incoming data streams to identify sensitive fields (e.g., PII, financial data) and their data types.
*   **GAN Training Module:** Trains a GAN (specifically, a Conditional GAN) for each sensitive field type. The GAN is conditioned on non-sensitive attributes to preserve correlations and utility. A labeled dataset is used for training, identifying sensitive attributes.
*   **Real-time Masking Engine:** Intercepts data requests. For each sensitive field, the engine queries the corresponding GAN to generate a synthetic replacement.
*   **Permission & Policy Manager:** Determines the level of masking applied based on user permissions, data usage policies, and the requesting application. A tiered system is utilized.
*   **Utility Assessment Module:** Periodically evaluates the utility of the masked data using pre-defined metrics and compares it to the original data to ensure acceptable performance.

**Workflow:**

1.  Data enters the system. The Data Profiler identifies sensitive fields.
2.  A data request is received. The Permission & Policy Manager determines the appropriate masking level.
3.  For each sensitive field, the Real-time Masking Engine:
    *   Extracts non-sensitive attributes associated with the data object.
    *   Inputs these attributes into the trained GAN.
    *   The GAN generates a synthetic value for the sensitive field.
    *   The synthetic value replaces the original sensitive value.
4.  The masked data is returned to the requesting application.
5.  The Utility Assessment Module continuously monitors data quality and retrains GANs as needed.

**Pseudocode (Real-time Masking Engine):**

```
function mask_data(data_object, permission_level):
    masked_object = data_object.copy()
    for field in data_object.keys():
        if is_sensitive(field):
            gan = get_gan(field)
            conditioning_variables = extract_conditioning_variables(data_object, field)
            synthetic_value = generate_synthetic_value(gan, conditioning_variables)
            masked_object[field] = synthetic_value
    return masked_object
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **GAN Registry:** A database storing trained GAN models, associated sensitive fields, and metadata.
*   **Permission Profiles:** Defines user permissions and associated masking levels for different data types.
*   **Utility Metrics Database:** Stores historical utility metrics for masked data, used for monitoring and GAN retraining.

**Scalability:**

*   The system can be deployed on a distributed architecture to handle large data volumes.
*   GAN models can be trained and deployed independently to improve performance.
*   Caching mechanisms can be used to store frequently accessed synthetic values.
