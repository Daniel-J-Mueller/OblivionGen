## Dynamic Concept Weighting Based on Real-Time User Engagement

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Functionality:**

The system dynamically adjusts the weight/prominence of concepts displayed in the concept list *based on real-time user interaction with search results*.  This isn't simply click-through rate, but a far more nuanced system capturing 'engagement depth' â€“ time spent viewing an item, scrolling through details, zooming on images, or triggering interactive elements (e.g., 360-degree views, video playbacks).

**II. Data Collection & Processing:**

1.  **Engagement Metrics:** The system will capture the following engagement metrics *per item viewed after a concept selection*:
    *   `ViewDuration`: Time (seconds) item is visible on screen.
    *   `ScrollDepth`: Percentage of item detail page scrolled.
    *   `InteractionCount`: Number of interactions (zoom, video play, 360 view, etc.).
    *   `Add-to-Cart`: Boolean flag indicating item added to cart.
    *   `Purchase`: Boolean flag indicating item purchased.

2.  **Engagement Score:** A composite `EngagementScore` will be calculated for each item:

    ```
    EngagementScore = (0.4 * ViewDuration) + (0.3 * ScrollDepth) + (0.3 * InteractionCount)
    ```

    *Weights can be adjusted based on A/B testing.*

3.  **Concept Performance:** For each concept, track the average `EngagementScore` of all items displayed under that concept.

4.  **Real-Time Weight Adjustment:**  The core innovation. Implement a feedback loop that dynamically adjusts concept weights based on performance:

    *   If a concept's average `EngagementScore` is *above* the overall average `EngagementScore` of all concepts, *increase* its weight/prominence in the concept list.
    *   If a concept's average `EngagementScore` is *below* the overall average, *decrease* its weight.
    *   The magnitude of the weight adjustment is controlled by a learning rate parameter (tunable).
    *   A 'decay' factor can be introduced to slowly revert concept weights towards a baseline, preventing over-optimization to short-term trends.

**III. Implementation Details:**

1.  **Frontend Integration:** The frontend needs to transmit engagement metrics to a backend server in real-time. WebSockets are ideal for low-latency communication.

2.  **Backend Infrastructure:** The backend requires a data pipeline for processing engagement metrics and updating concept weights.  A distributed caching system (e.g., Redis) will be used to store and serve concept weights efficiently.

3.  **Concept Taxonomy:**  The existing concept taxonomy should support a hierarchical structure. The system should be able to propagate weight adjustments *up* and *down* the hierarchy, ensuring that related concepts benefit from performance gains. (e.g. If 'Running Shoes' perform well, 'Athletic Shoes' should also receive a slight weight increase).

**IV. User Interface Adaptation:**

1.  **Dynamic Reordering:**  The concept list will be dynamically reordered based on calculated weights. Concepts with higher weights will appear *earlier* in the list.

2.  **Visual Emphasis:**  Consider visually emphasizing highly-performing concepts through subtle UI cues (e.g., bolder font weight, highlighting).

3.  **A/B Testing:**  Extensive A/B testing will be crucial for optimizing weight adjustment parameters, UI cues, and overall system performance.
