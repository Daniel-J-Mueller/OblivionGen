## Adaptive Haptic Feedback & Environmental Mapping for Device Control

**Core Concept:** Extend the reduced operational mode functionality to incorporate localized haptic feedback combined with environmental mapping to create a “virtual control panel” overlaid onto the device surface when certain components are disabled. This allows users to maintain intuitive control even with a reduced feature set.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Capacitive touch sensors – high resolution overlay across the front surface of the device.
    *   Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – Detect device orientation and movement.
    *   Ambient Light Sensor – Adjust haptic intensity based on lighting conditions.
    *   Optional: Low-resolution camera for basic surface scanning to dynamically adjust haptic mapping based on object placement.
*   **Haptic Actuator Array:** Piezoelectric actuators distributed beneath the device surface. Resolution: 5mm spacing. Force Range: 0-2N. Frequency Range: 50-250Hz.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   *Environmental Mapping Module*: Creates a dynamic map of the device surface, identifying areas available for haptic interaction.
    *   *Component Virtualization Module*: When a component is disabled in reduced operational mode, this module maps its functions onto the device surface. Example: If the volume control is disabled, a virtual rotary knob appears as a haptic sensation on the side of the device.
    *   *Haptic Rendering Engine*: Translates virtual controls into specific haptic patterns. Different textures, resistance levels, and click feedback can be simulated.
    *   *Gesture Recognition Module*:  Recognizes user gestures (e.g., swipes, taps, presses) on the haptic controls.
    *   *Adaptive Learning Module*: Learns user preferences and optimizes haptic feedback patterns for individual users.
*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   *Standard Reduced Mode*: Disables selected components and activates haptic controls for those functions.
    *   *Custom Mode*: Allows users to customize which components are disabled and how their functions are mapped to haptic controls.
    *   *Accessibility Mode*: Provides enhanced haptic feedback for users with visual impairments.
*   **Power Management:** Haptic actuators are low power. Utilize PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to control actuator intensity and minimize power consumption.

**Pseudocode (Component Virtualization):**

```
function virtualizeComponent(componentName) {
  if (componentName == "VolumeControl") {
    createHapticRotaryKnob(xPosition, yPosition, radius, resistanceLevel);
    bindGestureEvent("rotate", adjustVolume);
  } else if (componentName == "MusicPlayerControls") {
    createHapticButtons(playButtonPosition, pauseButtonPosition, nextButtonPosition);
    bindGestureEvent("tap", triggerAction);
  } else if (componentName == "BrightnessControl") {
    createHapticSlider(xPosition, yPosition, length, resistanceLevel);
    bindGestureEvent("slide", adjustBrightness);
  }
}
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond simply disabling components. It *replaces* the lost functionality with an intuitive, tactile interface directly on the device surface. This improves usability, allows for continued control, and creates a unique user experience. The adaptive learning component further personalizes the interface, making it more efficient and enjoyable. This offers a new degree of agency within restricted mode.
