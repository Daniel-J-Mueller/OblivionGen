## Decentralized Reputation System for Compromised Credentials

**Concept:** Extend the compromised authentication information clearing house concept into a decentralized, reputation-based system utilizing blockchain technology to create a more robust and transparent threat intelligence network. This moves beyond simple flagging and sharing to incentivized participation and nuanced risk assessment.

**Specs:**

*   **Blockchain Foundation:** Utilize a permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) to ensure data integrity and control access. A public blockchain is unsuitable due to sensitive data.
*   **Credential ‘Fingerprints’:** Instead of storing entire credentials, store cryptographic hashes ("fingerprints") of compromised credentials. This protects the actual credentials while still allowing for identification of compromised accounts.
*   **Reputation Tokens:** Introduce a cryptocurrency-like "Reputation Token" (RT). Entities (organizations, security firms, even individual researchers) earn RT by submitting accurate compromised credential fingerprints. Inaccurate submissions *reduce* their RT balance.
*   **Stake-Weighted Voting:** When a new credential fingerprint is submitted, RT holders can “stake” their tokens to vote on its validity. Higher stakes represent greater confidence. Validity is determined by a weighted average of staked tokens.
*   **Dynamic Access Control:** Access to compromised credential information is tiered based on the requestor's RT balance and “trust score” (derived from voting history and submission accuracy). Higher trust/balance = broader access.
*   **Automated Correlation:** Implement AI-powered algorithms to correlate seemingly disparate compromised credential fingerprints. This can reveal larger attack campaigns or shared infrastructure.
*   **API Integration:** Provide a robust API for seamless integration with existing SIEM, SOAR, and threat intelligence platforms.
*   **Smart Contract Governance:** Utilize smart contracts to automate the entire process – submission, voting, reward distribution, access control, and data updates.

**Pseudocode (Smart Contract - Simplified):**

```
contract CompromisedCreds {

  struct Credential {
    hash: string;
    submitter: address;
    votes: int[];
    valid: bool;
  }

  mapping(string => Credential) public credentials;
  mapping(address => int) public reputation;

  function submitCredential(string memory _hash) public {
    // Validate input
    credentials[_hash] = Credential( _hash, msg.sender, [], false);
    reputation[msg.sender] += 1; // Initial reward for submission
  }

  function voteCredential(string memory _hash, bool _isValid) public {
    // Verify voter's reputation
    // Add vote to Credential array
    // Update Credential.valid based on weighted average of votes
    // Adjust voter's reputation based on vote outcome and accuracy
  }

  function getCredentialInfo(string memory _hash) public view returns (string memory, bool) {
    // Return hash and validity status
  }

  //Additional functions for reputation management, dispute resolution, etc.

}
```

**Novelty:**  Existing compromised credential databases are typically centralized and opaque. This system introduces decentralization, incentivization, and transparency, creating a more resilient and trustworthy threat intelligence network. The use of reputation tokens and stake-weighted voting adds a game-theoretic element, encouraging accurate reporting and reducing false positives.
