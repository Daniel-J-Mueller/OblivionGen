## Adaptive Data Granularity Persistence

**Concept:** Expand upon selective data persistence by introducing *adaptive* granularity. Instead of persisting at the object or range level, the system dynamically determines the *optimal* granularity for persistence based on data volatility, access patterns, and system load.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Volatility Assessment Module:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors data access patterns within system memory. Assigns a volatility score to each data block (initially, a fixed size, configurable by system administrator – e.g., 64KB).
*   **Metrics:**
    *   Write frequency: How often is the block modified?
    *   Read frequency: How often is the block accessed?
    *   Time since last modification: How long ago was the block last written to?
    *   Dependency analysis: Identify data dependencies – which blocks rely on others?
*   **Algorithm:** A weighted scoring system. Higher write frequency & lower time since last modification = higher volatility. Dependencies increase volatility of related blocks.
*   **Output:** Volatility score for each data block.

**2. Dynamic Granularity Controller:**

*   **Function:** Based on volatility scores and system load, determines the granularity of persistence.
*   **Granularity Levels:**
    *   **Fine-grained:** Individual data blocks (smallest unit)
    *   **Medium-grained:** Aggregated blocks (e.g., 4x data block size)
    *   **Coarse-grained:** Larger aggregated blocks (e.g., 16x data block size, application object level).
*   **Decision Logic:**
    *   High volatility, low system load: Fine-grained persistence.
    *   Medium volatility, moderate load: Medium-grained persistence.
    *   Low volatility, high load: Coarse-grained persistence.
*   **Algorithm:** A rule-based system, potentially incorporating machine learning to optimize granularity selection over time.

**3.  Persistence Manager:**

*   **Function:** Handles the actual data copying to non-volatile storage and recovery.
*   **Integration:** Works with the Dynamic Granularity Controller to copy only the data blocks at the currently selected granularity level.
*   **Mapping:** Maintains detailed mapping information between system memory locations and non-volatile storage locations *at the chosen granularity*. This is critical for recovery.
*   **Checksums/Error Correction:**  Incorporates data integrity checks for each persisted block.

**4. Recovery Mechanism:**

*   **Function:** Recovers data from non-volatile storage after a system failure.
*   **Granularity Awareness:** Uses the mapping information and the *original* granularity setting to restore data to the correct memory locations.
*   **Selective Recovery:** Only recovers data blocks that were marked for persistence.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Granularity Controller):**

```
function determineGranularity(dataBlock, systemLoad):
  volatilityScore = DataVolatilityAssessmentModule.getVolatilityScore(dataBlock)

  if systemLoad > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
    granularity = COARSE_GRAINED
  else if volatilityScore > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
    granularity = FINE_GRAINED
  else if volatilityScore > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
    granularity = MEDIUM_GRAINED
  else:
    granularity = COARSE_GRAINED #default

  return granularity
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems typically persist at fixed levels (object or range). This system adapts the granularity based on runtime conditions, maximizing performance and minimizing overhead. It enables a more nuanced approach to data preservation, potentially improving responsiveness during normal operation and ensuring critical data is protected during failures.  The dynamic selection and runtime mapping create a more robust and efficient system.
