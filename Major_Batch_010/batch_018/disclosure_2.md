## Dynamic Content Object ‘Lifecycles’ & Automated Archiving

**Concept:** Extend the core ‘content object’ concept to include automated lifecycle management, transitioning objects through states (Active, Review, Archived, Destroyed) based on defined rules *and* user interactions. This moves beyond simple accessibility flags and introduces a dynamic content governance system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Content Object State Definitions:**

*   **Active:** Default state. Content object fully accessible per defined permissions.
*   **Review:** Object flagged for review (e.g., accuracy, relevance). Access restricted to designated reviewers.  Triggers notification to assigned reviewers.
*   **Archived:** Object removed from immediate access but retained for compliance/historical purposes. Access limited to administrators/compliance officers.  Automatic logging of archiving event.
*   **Destroyed:** Object permanently removed. Requires administrator override and complete audit trail.

**2. State Transition Rules:**

*   **Time-Based:** Objects automatically transition to ‘Review’ or ‘Archived’ after a defined period of inactivity or inactivity since last modification.
*   **Interaction-Based:**  Transition triggered by user activity. Example: If a content object receives no views/downloads for 90 days, it moves to ‘Review’.
*   **Event-Based:** Transition triggered by external events. Example: Legal hold placed on an object moves it to ‘Archived’ and prevents deletion.
*   **User-Initiated:** Users (with appropriate permissions) can manually trigger transitions.

**3. System Components:**

*   **State Management Module:** Core component responsible for tracking object states and enforcing transitions.
*   **Rule Engine:**  Defines and executes the state transition rules.  Rules configurable via a user interface.
*   **Notification System:** Alerts users (owners, reviewers, administrators) about state changes.
*   **Audit Logging:** Records all state transitions, including the triggering event and the user responsible.
*   **Archival System Integration:**  Seamless integration with existing archival storage solutions.

**4. Pseudocode (State Transition Logic):**

```
Function TransitionState(contentObject, newState, triggeringEvent, user) {
  // Check if transition is valid based on current state and permissions
  If (IsValidTransition(contentObject, newState)) {
    // Log the transition event
    LogTransition(contentObject, newState, triggeringEvent, user);

    // Update content object state
    contentObject.state = newState;

    // Trigger actions based on new state (e.g., send notification, move to archive)
    If (newState == "Archived") {
      ArchiveContent(contentObject);
    } Else If (newState == "Destroyed") {
      DestroyContent(contentObject);
    }
  } Else {
    // Log invalid transition attempt
    LogInvalidTransition(contentObject, newState);
  }
}
```

**5. User Interface Adaptations:**

*   **Content Object Details Panel:** Display the current state of the object prominently.
*   **State Transition Menu:** Allow users to manually trigger state transitions (with appropriate permissions).
*   **Rule Management Dashboard:** Allow administrators to define and manage the state transition rules.
*   **Reporting & Analytics:** Provide reports on content object lifecycles, including the number of objects in each state and the reasons for transitions.
