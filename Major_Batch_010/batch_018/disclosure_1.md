## Dynamic Watermarking with Perceptual Hashing & Temporal Drift

**Concept:** Expand the "proof of ownership" idea beyond static audio fingerprints to a dynamic system that actively adapts to minor alterations in the original audio, while simultaneously building a verifiable history of modifications. This leverages perceptual hashing to create a “drift map” showing how the audio has evolved.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Component: Perceptual Hash Drift Map**

   *   **Algorithm:** Employ a robust perceptual hashing algorithm (e.g., one based on spectral centroid, rolloff, and chroma features). This algorithm must produce a relatively stable hash even with minor EQ, compression, or noise addition.
   *   **Temporal Segmentation:** Divide the audio into short, overlapping segments (e.g., 1-3 seconds). Calculate the perceptual hash for each segment.
   *   **Drift Calculation:**  Establish a baseline "drift map" when the audio is first registered.  Each subsequent hash calculation for a segment is compared to its baseline. The difference (Euclidean distance between feature vectors) represents the “drift” for that segment. 
   *   **Drift Threshold:** Define a threshold for acceptable drift.  Drift exceeding the threshold indicates a significant alteration.
   *   **History Storage:** Store the history of drift values for each segment, timestamped.  This creates a “drift timeline” for each portion of the audio.

**2.  Ownership Verification System**

   *   **Initial Registration:** Upon first use, a “seed” random number is generated and used to encrypt a hash of the entire audio file. This encrypted hash is stored as the "Root of Trust".
   *   **Challenge-Response Protocol:**  To verify ownership, the system issues a "challenge" – a request for the drift values for specific segments at specific timestamps.
   *   **Response Generation:** The client (owner) provides the requested drift values. These values are combined with the seed random number and a current timestamp and fed into a cryptographic hash function. The result is the “Verification Token”.
   *   **Server Validation:** The server recalculates the Verification Token using the seed, requested drift values, and current timestamp.  If the tokens match, ownership is verified. 
   *   **Drift Tolerance:** The system allows for a configurable amount of drift tolerance. Minor drift is acceptable. Significant drift triggers a deeper inspection of the drift timeline.

**3.  Modification History and Attribution**

   *   **Automated Change Detection:** Monitor the drift timeline for sudden spikes or consistent trends. These events indicate modifications.
   *   **Attribution System:** If modifications are detected, the system attempts to identify the source of the change (e.g., user ID, timestamp of the modification, type of modification).
   *   **Provenance Tracking:**  Build a complete provenance record of all modifications to the audio file, including the original version, all modifications, and the identity of the modifier.

**Pseudocode (Verification Process - Server Side):**

```
function verifyOwnership(seed, requestedSegments, requestedTimestamps, receivedDriftValues):
  // Reconstruct the challenge from the received data
  challenge = concatenate(seed, requestedSegments, requestedTimestamps, receivedDriftValues)

  // Hash the challenge
  verificationToken = SHA256(challenge)

  // Compare the calculated token to the stored token
  if (verificationToken == storedVerificationToken):
    return True  // Ownership verified
  else:
    return False // Ownership failed
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Robust Perceptual Hashing Library (e.g., librosa, Essentia)
*   Cryptographic Hash Function Library (e.g., OpenSSL)
*   Secure Storage for Seed, Root of Trust, and Drift History
*   Scalable Database for Drift History
*   API for Challenge-Response Protocol
*   Client SDK for drift value retrieval and response generation.
