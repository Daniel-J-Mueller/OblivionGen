## Temporal Data Weaving & Predictive Partitioning

**Concept:** Extend the point-in-time restoration concept to proactively 'weave' partitions based on predicted data access patterns and future split scenarios, effectively pre-computing backup states. This anticipates partition splits *before* they happen, lessening restoration time and resource overhead.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Temporal Weaver (TW) - A service running alongside the database service.
*   **Data Input:**
    *   Real-time database write stream.
    *   Historical query logs (frequency of access by partition, time-series analysis).
    *   Schema change logs (partition split declarations *prior* to execution).
    *   Predictive Model (PM) â€“ Trained on historical data, predicts future partition splits and access patterns.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Prediction Phase:** PM analyzes historical data to predict likely partition splits (based on data volume, access patterns, schema changes) and access patterns *before* splits occur.
    2.  **Weaving Phase:** TW intercepts write stream. Based on PM predictions, TW creates 'shadow' partitions representing future split states. Writes are applied to both current and predicted shadow partitions.
    3.  **Snapshotting:** TW periodically snapshots shadow partitions *alongside* current partitions. These snapshots represent 'pre-baked' backup states for predicted splits.
    4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** PM constantly re-evaluates predictions based on incoming data. TW dynamically adjusts shadow partition creation/snapshotting based on this feedback.
    5.  **Metadata Store:**  A dedicated metadata store tracks prediction confidence, shadow partition mappings, snapshot versions, and associated data lineage.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On Write Operation
function handleWrite(writeOperation) {
  predictedShadowPartitions = PredictiveModel.getPredictedShadowPartitions(writeOperation.targetPartition);
  applyWriteToPartitions(writeOperation, [writeOperation.targetPartition] + predictedShadowPartitions);
  TemporalWeaver.snapshotShadowPartitions(predictedShadowPartitions);
}

// On Partition Split Declaration (prior to execution)
function handleSplitDeclaration(splitDeclaration) {
  // Pre-compute shadow partitions immediately, accelerating future restoration.
  TemporalWeaver.preSplitShadowPartitions(splitDeclaration);
}

//On Read Operation
function handleRead(readOperation) {
    //If read is for a past time, coalesce current data with shadow snapshots
    if (readOperation.timestamp < currentTime) {
        readOperation.data = coalesceData(readOperation, shadowSnapshots);
    } else {
        //Serve data from current partitions
        readOperation.data = serveData(readOperation);
    }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Shadow Partition Metadata:** {PartitionID, PredictedSplitTime, ConfidenceScore, SnapshotVersions}
*   **Data Lineage Map:**  Maps data writes to shadow partition snapshots, enabling precise point-in-time restoration.

**Error Handling:**

*   If PM predictions are consistently inaccurate, revert to standard backup procedures.
*   Implement throttling mechanisms to prevent excessive shadow partition creation.
*   Monitor resource usage (storage, CPU) associated with shadow partitions.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Near-instantaneous point-in-time restoration, even for recently split partitions.
*   Reduced restoration resource overhead.
*   Proactive data protection against unforeseen split scenarios.
*   Enhanced data resilience and availability.
