## Dynamic Payment Token Persona

**Concept:** Expand the single-use payment token into a dynamic “persona” tied to the user account, influencing redemption conditions and offering tiered access based on user behavior/trust.

**Specifications:**

*   **Persona Profiles:** User accounts will have associated "Persona Profiles" – configurable sets of redemption rules. These profiles are not fixed; they *evolve* based on transaction history, user-defined preferences, and potentially external data sources (e.g., social media verification).
*   **Tiered Access:** Persona profiles define tiers (e.g., Basic, Verified, Premium) determining redemption conditions. A "Basic" tier might require strong security verification (security question + code), while a “Premium” tier (achieved through frequent, successful transactions) could allow redemption with only image code capture.
*   **Dynamic Rule Engine:** A server-side rule engine will assess each token request and redemption attempt against the user’s current Persona Profile. Rules can cover:
    *   **Recipient Restrictions:**  Allow/disallow redemption by specific recipients.
    *   **Time-Based Constraints:**  Restrict redemption to specific days/times.
    *   **Location-Based Restrictions:** Allow redemption only within a defined geographic area.
    *   **Transaction Limits:** Set maximum redemption amounts per period.
    *   **Item/Service Restrictions:** Allow redemption only for specified items or services.
*   **Token Generation API:**  The token generation API accepts parameters influencing Persona Profile access.  For example:
    *   `persona_override`:  Forces a specific Persona Profile (for testing/admin).
    *   `recipient_lock`:  Locks the token to a specific recipient (overriding profile settings).
    *   `expiration_boost`:  Extends the token's lifetime based on user trust level.
*   **Image Code Enhancement:** Image codes will include a subtly embedded “Persona Indicator” (visual watermark or encoded data) identifying the active profile. This allows the recipient's device to display a tailored message (e.g., "Verification Required," "Trusted User").
*   **Security Identifier Adaptation:** The security identifier system will become multi-layered. Instead of *just* a PIN, it could include biometric authentication (fingerprint/facial recognition) triggered by the image code capture. The Persona Profile dictates the required level of authentication.
*    **Redemption Feedback Loop:** Successful/failed redemption attempts contribute to the user’s trust score, adjusting their Persona Profile tier in real-time.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side Redemption Validation):**

```
FUNCTION validateRedemption(tokenId, recipientId, amount, imageCode)

  userAccount = GET_ACCOUNT(tokenId)
  personaProfile = GET_PERSONA_PROFILE(userAccount.id)

  IF personaProfile.tier == "Basic"
    securityCodeValid = VERIFY_SECURITY_CODE(tokenId, imageCode)
    IF NOT securityCodeValid
      RETURN "SECURITY_FAILED"
  ENDIF

  IF personaProfile.recipientLock != "" AND recipientId != personaProfile.recipientLock
    RETURN "RECIPIENT_RESTRICTED"
  ENDIF

  IF current_time NOT WITHIN personaProfile.redemptionWindow
    RETURN "TIME_RESTRICTED"
  ENDIF

  IF amount > personaProfile.maxRedemptionAmount
    RETURN "AMOUNT_EXCEEDED"
  ENDIF

  IF personaProfile.allowedServices DOES NOT CONTAIN requestedService
    RETURN "SERVICE_RESTRICTED"
  ENDIF

  transferFunds(userAccount, recipientAccount, amount)
  UPDATE_PERSONA_PROFILE(userAccount.id, success=TRUE)

  RETURN "SUCCESS"

END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Recipient device needs a camera capable of reliably capturing and decoding the Persona Indicator within the image code.
*   Biometric authentication may require compatible hardware on both user and recipient devices.
