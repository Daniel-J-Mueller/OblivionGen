## Adaptive Granularity Weighting

**Concept:** Extend the multilevel list weight assignment to operate not just on virtual machine instances, but on *sub-components* within those instances – specifically, application features or microservices. This enables finer-grained load balancing and resource allocation.

**Specs:**

1.  **Component Registry:** Introduce a 'Component Registry' service. This service maintains a mapping between virtual machine instances and the components (features/microservices) they host.  Each component is assigned a unique identifier.

2.  **Component-Level Multilevel Lists:**  Maintain *multiple* sets of multilevel lists. One set per component type (e.g., 'Authentication', 'Database Query', 'Image Processing').  Each list within a set manages weights for virtual machine instances *specifically* regarding that component.

3.  **Request Tagging:** Incoming requests are tagged with the component(s) they require.  This could be based on URL path, header information, or a dedicated request attribute.

4.  **Dynamic Weight Assignment:** 
    *   The load balancer examines the request tag.
    *   It selects the appropriate component-level multilevel list.
    *   It uses the weight values from *that* list to select a target virtual machine instance.
    *   If a VM has low weight for the requested component, the request is routed elsewhere.

5.  **Health Checks – Component Specific:** Health checks are modified to verify the health of *individual components* within a VM, not just the VM itself.  A VM can be considered "healthy" overall but have a specific component failing.

6.  **Weight Adjustment - Component Performance:** Integrate performance monitoring for each component. Weight adjustments are triggered not just by overall VM load, but by the performance of individual components.  For instance, if the 'Database Query' component on VM-A is slow, its weight in the 'Database Query' multilevel list is decreased.

7.  **Adaptive Granularity Control:** Implement a 'Granularity Level' parameter, configurable per target group. 
    *   Level 1: Traditional VM-level weight assignment (as in the source patent).
    *   Level 2: Component-level weight assignment (described above).
    *   Level 3:  Further decompose components into 'tasks'. For example, a 'Database Query' component could be broken down into ‘read’ and ‘write’ tasks, each with independent weighting.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION selectTarget(request):
  tag = request.getTag()
  granularity = getGranularityLevel(request.getTargetGroup())

  IF granularity == 1:
    target = selectFromVMList(request.getTargetGroup().getVMList())
  ELSE IF granularity == 2:
    componentList = getComponentList(tag)
    target = selectFromComponentList(componentList, request.getTargetGroup().getComponentLists())
  ELSE IF granularity == 3:
    task = getTask(tag)
    target = selectFromTaskList(task, request.getTargetGroup().getTaskLists())
  ELSE:
    target = selectFromVMList(request.getTargetGroup().getVMList()) //Default to VM level

  RETURN target

FUNCTION selectFromComponentList(component, componentLists):
  weightLevels = componentLists.getWeightLevels(component)
  weightedTargets = calculateWeightedTargets(weightLevels)
  target = selectRandomTarget(weightedTargets)
  RETURN target
```
