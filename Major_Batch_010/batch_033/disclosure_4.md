## Dynamic Instruction Duplication for Predictive Thermal Management

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A hardware performance monitoring unit (PMU) extension coupled with a dynamic instruction duplicator.
*   **PMU Extension:** Monitors core temperatures, power consumption, and execution bottlenecks *per instruction stream*. Not just core-wide, but granular to the flow of instructions.
*   **Dynamic Instruction Duplicator:**  A dedicated hardware block capable of duplicating specific instructions or instruction blocks *on the fly*. Duplication is not a full copy; itâ€™s a controlled replication with adjustable execution timing.
*   **Control Logic:** An embedded controller (firmware/microcontroller) that interfaces with the PMU and the instruction duplicator. It acts as the 'brain' of the system.
*   **Instruction Tagging:**  A mechanism to tag instructions with thermal/power profiles during compilation. These profiles are estimates but provide a baseline.
*   **Memory Buffer:** Small, high-speed buffer to store duplicated instruction blocks.

**Operation:**

1.  **Compilation Phase:** Compiler analyzes instruction stream, identifies potential thermal hotspots (as in the provided patent, but expanded), and tags instructions with thermal/power profile estimates.
2.  **Runtime Monitoring:** PMU continuously monitors core temperatures and power consumption *for each active instruction stream*. 
3.  **Predictive Analysis:** Control Logic predicts thermal stress based on:
    *   PMU readings
    *   Instruction thermal/power tags
    *   Historical data
4.  **Dynamic Duplication:** If a predicted hotspot exceeds a threshold, the Control Logic instructs the Duplicator to duplicate a *preceding* instruction (or a small block of instructions) on a different core/execution unit. 
    *   The duplicated instruction is delayed slightly relative to the original.
    *   This effectively distributes the workload over time and space, smoothing out thermal spikes.
5.  **Adaptive Adjustment:**  The delay and number of duplicated instructions are adjusted *dynamically* based on PMU feedback.

**Pseudocode (Control Logic):**

```
// Global Variables
thermal_threshold = 85; // Celsius
duplication_factor = 2; // Number of duplicated instructions
delay_increment = 1; // Cycles

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Read PMU data
    temperature = read_temperature();
    power_consumption = read_power_consumption();

    // Predict thermal stress
    predicted_temperature = predict_temperature(temperature, power_consumption);

    // Check if threshold is exceeded
    if (predicted_temperature > thermal_threshold) {
        // Identify instruction to duplicate (based on hotspot analysis)
        instruction_to_duplicate = find_hotspot_instruction();

        // Duplicate instruction on another core
        duplicate_instruction(instruction_to_duplicate, core_selection());

        // Introduce delay to duplicated instruction
        delay_instruction(duplicated_instruction, delay_increment);

        // Adjust delay based on feedback
        if (temperature > thermal_threshold) {
            delay_increment += 1;
        } else {
            delay_increment -= 1;
        }
    }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This approach isn't simply inserting delays; it proactively *duplicates* instructions before a thermal limit is reached, spreading the workload.  The dynamic adjustment of the duplication factor and delay provides a finer-grained level of thermal control than static or reactive methods.  It's a preventative measure, smoothing out thermal spikes before they happen. The use of instruction tagging allows the system to learn and adapt to different workloads.
