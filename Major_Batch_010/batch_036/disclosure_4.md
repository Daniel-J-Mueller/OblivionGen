## Adaptive Spatial Index Granularity based on Sensor Density

**Concept:** The patent focuses on distributed object recognition with a spatial index. This builds on that by dynamically adjusting the granularity of the spatial index based on the *density* of sensors reporting into a specific region. Areas with high sensor density (e.g., a crowded retail space) get a finer-grained index for precise localization, while sparse areas (e.g., a warehouse exterior) use a coarser index to reduce computational load and storage.

**Specs:**

*   **Components:**
    *   *Sensor Density Map (SDM):* A continuously updated map representing the density of active sensors within defined geographical regions. Regions are defined by a grid, quadtree, or similar spatial partitioning scheme.
    *   *Granularity Controller:* A service responsible for monitoring the SDM and adjusting the spatial index granularity for each region.
    *   *Adaptive Spatial Index (ASI):* The spatial index itself, capable of dynamically adjusting its granularity. The underlying data structure could be a modified K-D tree, cover tree, or HNSW graph.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `Region`:
        *   `regionID`: Unique identifier for the geographical region.
        *   `sensorCount`: Number of active sensors within the region.
        *   `granularityLevel`: Integer representing the index granularity (e.g., 1 = coarse, 5 = fine).
        *   `indexPartition`: Pointer to the ASI partition for this region.
*   **Algorithms:**

    1.  **Sensor Density Update:**

        ```pseudocode
        function updateSensorDensity(sensorID, location):
          region = findRegion(location)
          region.sensorCount += 1
          // Trigger granularity adjustment if sensor count exceeds a threshold
          triggerGranularityAdjustment(region)
        ```

    2.  **Granularity Adjustment:**

        ```pseudocode
        function triggerGranularityAdjustment(region):
          if region.sensorCount > HIGH_DENSITY_THRESHOLD:
            newGranularity = FINE_GRANULARITY
          elif region.sensorCount < LOW_DENSITY_THRESHOLD:
            newGranularity = COARSE_GRANULARITY
          else:
            newGranularity = MEDIUM_GRANULARITY

          if newGranularity != region.granularityLevel:
            rebuildIndexPartition(region, newGranularity)
            region.granularityLevel = newGranularity
        ```

    3.  **Index Partition Rebuild:**

        ```pseudocode
        function rebuildIndexPartition(region, granularity):
          // 1. Query data sources for embeddings within the region
          // 2.  Based on the granularity level, apply different data reduction or aggregation techniques:
          if granularity == FINE_GRANULARITY:
            // Store individual embeddings with high precision
          elif granularity == MEDIUM_GRANULARITY:
            // Cluster embeddings and store cluster centroids
          elif granularity == COARSE_GRANULARITY:
            // Aggregate embeddings into a single representative vector

          // 3. Build or update the ASI partition for the region using the processed embeddings
        ```

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /sensor/report`: Reports a sensor reading with location.
    *   `GET /region/{regionID}/granularity`: Returns the current granularity level for a region.
    *   `POST /region/{regionID}/adjustGranularity`:  Manually adjusts the granularity of a region (for testing/override).
*   **Deployment Considerations:**
    *   The Sensor Density Map and Granularity Controller should be highly scalable and distributed.
    *   Consider using a time-series database to store historical sensor density data for predictive adjustments.
    *   The algorithm should be tunable to optimize performance and accuracy based on the specific application.

This approach introduces a dynamic layer to the spatial index, allowing the system to adapt to varying sensor densities and optimize resource utilization. It's particularly relevant for applications involving a large number of distributed sensors in environments with highly variable sensor coverage.
