## Variable Geometry Conveyance – Modular Orbital System

**Concept:** Expand the parallel-axis rotary conveyance to a dynamically reconfigurable, multi-planar orbital system. Instead of fixed parallel wheels, envision a network of individually addressable, motorized ‘orbital nodes.’ These nodes aren’t simply wheels but multi-axis gimbaled platforms capable of adjusting their orientation and orbital path.

**Specifications:**

*   **Node Construction:** Each orbital node comprises:
    *   A robust aluminum chassis.
    *   Three high-precision stepper motors: one for rotational orbit, one for vertical tilt, one for horizontal pan.
    *   Embedded microcontroller (ESP32 or similar) with wireless communication (WiFi/Bluetooth).
    *   Proximity/IR sensors for collision avoidance and tote detection.
    *   Magnetic or inductive charging receiver.
    *   Universal mounting interface for tote support structures.
*   **Track System:** Nodes operate within a defined 3D space using a modular track system. Tracks are composed of interlocking, lightweight carbon fiber or aluminum segments. Segments can be configured to create loops, branches, and elevation changes.
*   **Tote Interface:** Totes are equipped with RFID tags for identification and tracking. Totes feature a standardized magnetic base for secure attachment to node support structures.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Central Control System:** Cloud-based software platform for managing the orbital network. Features:
        *   Node configuration and calibration.
        *   Tote tracking and assignment.
        *   Path planning and optimization.
        *   Real-time monitoring and diagnostics.
        *   API for integration with warehouse management systems (WMS).
    *   **Node Firmware:** Embedded software for controlling node movement and sensors.
        *   Receives instructions from the Central Control System.
        *   Executes motion profiles.
        *   Monitors sensor data.
        *   Reports status to the Central Control System.

**Operational Pseudocode (Central Control System):**

```
FUNCTION AssignToteToPath(toteID, destinationNodeID):
    // Get current tote location
    currentLocation = GetToteLocation(toteID)

    // Calculate optimal path from currentLocation to destinationNodeID
    optimalPath = CalculatePath(currentLocation, destinationNodeID)

    // Assign path to toteID
    AssignPathToTote(toteID, optimalPath)

FUNCTION  CalculatePath(startNodeID, endNodeID):
    // Use A* search algorithm or similar pathfinding technique
    // Consider node capacity, collision avoidance, and energy efficiency
    // Return a sequence of node IDs representing the optimal path
    path = AStar(startNodeID, endNodeID, networkGraph)
    RETURN path

FUNCTION MoveTote(toteID):
    // Get assigned path for toteID
    path = GetTotePath(toteID)

    // Iterate through path
    FOR each nodeID in path:
        // Send command to previous node to release tote
        SendReleaseCommand(previousNodeID, toteID)

        // Send command to current node to move to next position
        SendMoveCommand(currentnodeID, nextNodeID)
        // Wait until node reaches destination
        WaitUntilReachedDestination(currentnodeID, nextNodeID)

        // Update tote location
        UpdateToteLocation(toteID, nextNodeID)
END FOR
```

**Innovation:** Dynamic reconfigurability. The orbital network can adapt to changing warehouse layouts, accommodate different tote sizes, and optimize workflow in real-time. Multiple totes can operate on the same orbital plane, or be elevated to different planes. This approach moves beyond simple linear conveyance to create a truly 3D, autonomous material handling system.
