## Predictive Interface Adaptation via Event Entropy

**Specification:** A system that dynamically adjusts user interface (UI) elements based on real-time analysis of event entropy derived from user interaction data, proactively anticipating user needs and simplifying interface complexity.

**Core Concept:** The patent details persistent storage of event data. This inspires a system that doesn’t *just* store events, but uses event *patterns* – specifically, a measure of unpredictability in those patterns – to reshape the UI. High entropy suggests exploration or uncertainty; low entropy suggests a predictable workflow. The system adapts to maximize efficiency given the current ‘cognitive load’ of the user.

**System Components:**

1.  **Event Entropy Engine:**
    *   Input: Stream of event data (mouse clicks, scrolls, keystrokes, impressions, time spent on elements).
    *   Process: Calculates Shannon entropy for event sequences over sliding time windows.  Higher entropy = more random/unpredictable actions.
    *   Output: Entropy score (0-1) representing the current level of user unpredictability.

    ```pseudocode
    function calculateEntropy(eventSequence):
      totalEvents = length(eventSequence)
      if totalEvents == 0:
        return 0
      eventCounts = {}
      for event in eventSequence:
        if event in eventCounts:
          eventCounts[event] += 1
        else:
          eventCounts[event] = 1
      entropy = 0
      for event, count in eventCounts.items():
        probability = count / totalEvents
        entropy -= probability * log2(probability)
      return entropy
    ```

2.  **UI Adaptation Module:**
    *   Input: Entropy score from the Event Entropy Engine.
    *   Process:  Applies a set of pre-defined adaptation rules based on the entropy score.  Rules are customizable and context-aware (application, current page, user profile).
    *   Output:  Instructions to dynamically modify the UI.

    ```pseudocode
    function adaptUI(entropyScore, currentContext):
      if entropyScore > 0.7:  // High entropy - User is exploring
        // Display more options/hints/tooltips
        showHelpOverlay(currentContext)
        expandSidebar()
      else if entropyScore < 0.3:  // Low entropy - User is in a workflow
        // Hide distracting elements/simplify interface
        hideSidebar()
        collapseAdvancedOptions()
      else: // Moderate entropy - Standard UI
        showStandardUI()
    ```

3.  **Predictive Element Pre-Fetch:**
    *   Input: Event data, Entropy score, User Profile.
    *   Process:  Utilizes machine learning (e.g., Markov models, RNNs) to predict the *next* UI elements the user is likely to interact with based on current event sequence, entropy, and profile. Pre-fetches resources (images, data, code) for these elements to reduce latency.
    *   Output:  List of elements to pre-fetch.

4.  **Dynamic Tool Palette:**
    *   Based on entropy and predicted actions, dynamically construct and prioritize a tool palette for quick access to relevant functions. High entropy – broader palette. Low entropy – streamlined palette.

**Integration with Existing System:**

*   The Event Entropy Engine leverages the persistent event data storage described in the patent.
*   Adaptation rules are stored as metadata associated with UI components.
*   Machine learning models are trained on historical event data.

**Novelty:**

*   **Entropy-Driven Adaptation:**  Most adaptive UIs rely on explicitly defined user goals or pre-programmed rules. This system adapts based on the *unpredictability* of user behavior, providing a more nuanced and proactive experience.
*   **Predictive Element Pre-Fetch:**  Reduces perceived latency and improves responsiveness by anticipating user needs.
*   **Dynamic Tool Palette:** Simplifies the interface by prioritizing relevant functions.
