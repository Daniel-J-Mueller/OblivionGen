## Temporal Data Shadowing & Predictive Restoration

**Concept:** Extend the selective data restoration concept to create *proactive* data shadows, enabling not just point-in-time recovery, but also *prediction* of data states and automated conflict resolution.

**Specification:**

**I. Shadow Generation Module:**

*   **Trigger:** Activated by configurable events (e.g., significant data changes, scheduled intervals, user request).
*   **Function:** Captures a “shadow” of the dataset, *not* simply the changes (deltas) but a complete, consistent snapshot, optimized for storage (e.g., using compression, deduplication). Shadow creation can be partial, focusing on key data sections determined by a configurable policy.
*   **Storage:** Shadows are stored in a separate, highly-available storage tier (e.g., object storage, distributed file system) indexed by time and relevant keys.
*   **Metadata:** Each shadow stores metadata including:
    *   Timestamp of capture.
    *   Keys used for indexing.
    *   Policy applied during capture (e.g., full snapshot, partial snapshot, key filtering).
    *   “Confidence Score” - a metric reflecting the reliability/completeness of the shadow.  Derived from capture process health and data validation checks.

**II. Temporal Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Stream of change data, historical shadow data, configurable prediction parameters (e.g., weighting factors for historical data, smoothing algorithms).
*   **Function:** Analyzes change data and historical shadows to predict future data states. Can create multiple prediction branches based on different scenarios or weighting factors.
*   **Output:**  “Predicted Data States” -  possible future values for specific data elements, associated with a “Prediction Confidence Score”.

**III. Automated Conflict Resolution Module:**

*   **Trigger:** When a data modification attempts to update a record with conflicting changes (e.g., concurrent updates).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Identify conflicting changes.
    2.  Consult Temporal Prediction Engine for predicted data states.
    3.  Compare current changes with predicted states.
    4.  Based on configurable rules:
        *   **Accept Current Change:** If the current change aligns with a high-confidence prediction.
        *   **Revert Current Change:** If the current change contradicts a high-confidence prediction.
        *   **Present Options to User:**  Display both the current change and the predicted change for manual resolution via a recovery console (similar to Claim 4 in the patent).
        *   **Automated Merge:**  Attempt to automatically merge changes based on configurable algorithms.
*   **Logging:** All resolution decisions are logged with timestamps, user IDs (if applicable), and confidence scores.

**Pseudocode (Automated Conflict Resolution):**

```
function resolveConflict(currentChange, conflictingData, predictionData):
  confidenceScore = predictionData.confidenceScore

  if confidenceScore > threshold_accept:
    // Accept current change - prediction aligns
    applyChange(currentChange)
    logDecision("Accepted", confidenceScore)
    return

  if confidenceScore < threshold_reject:
    // Reject current change - prediction disagrees
    revertChange(currentChange)
    logDecision("Rejected", confidenceScore)
    return

  // Present options to user via recovery console (as per Claim 4)
  displayChanges(currentChange, conflictingData)
  userSelection = getUserSelection()

  if userSelection == "Accept":
    applyChange(currentChange)
  else:
    revertChange(currentChange)

  logDecision("User Resolved", confidenceScore)
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Scalability of the Shadow Storage Module.
*   Performance of the Temporal Prediction Engine (real-time vs. batch processing).
*   Complexity of the Automated Conflict Resolution rules.
*   Integration with existing data access layers.
*   Policy-driven configuration of shadow creation and conflict resolution parameters.
