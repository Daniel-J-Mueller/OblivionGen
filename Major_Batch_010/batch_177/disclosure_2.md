## Dynamic Haptic Guidance System

**Concept:** Augment the visual guidance system with localized haptic feedback delivered directly to the user's hand/fingers. This creates a multi-sensory experience, enhancing accuracy and speed of biometric identification.

**Specifications:**

*   **Haptic Array:** A flexible array of micro-actuators integrated into a wristband or glove. Actuator density: >200 actuators/square cm. Actuator type: Electroactive polymers (EAP) or microfluidic systems for precise, localized pressure.
*   **Sensor Fusion:** System integrates data from distance sensors, camera, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) within the wristband/glove to determine hand position, orientation, and movement in real-time.
*   **Guidance Algorithm:**
    1.  **Target Zone Definition:** Software defines a precise 3D target zone for hand/finger placement.
    2.  **Deviation Calculation:**  Calculate the deviation of the userâ€™s hand/fingers from the target zone based on sensor data.
    3.  **Haptic Mapping:** Map the deviation to a haptic signal. The signal's intensity and location on the haptic array correspond to the direction and magnitude of the deviation.  For example:
        *   *X-axis deviation:* Apply pressure to the corresponding side of the hand.
        *   *Y-axis deviation:* Apply pressure to the top or bottom of the hand.
        *   *Z-axis deviation (depth):*  Vary the overall pressure across the hand.
        *   *Rotation:* Use directional vibrations to indicate rotational adjustment.
    4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The haptic signal dynamically adjusts in real-time as the user moves their hand, providing continuous guidance.
*   **Software Interface:**
    *   Calibration routine to map hand geometry and optimize haptic feedback.
    *   Adjustable intensity and sensitivity settings.
    *   Option to disable visual guidance and rely solely on haptic feedback.
    *   API for integration with existing biometric authentication systems.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Guidance Loop):**

```
loop:
    // Get sensor data
    distance_data = get_distance_sensor_data()
    imu_data = get_imu_data()
    camera_data = get_camera_data()

    // Calculate hand position and orientation
    hand_position, hand_orientation = calculate_hand_pose(distance_data, imu_data, camera_data)

    // Calculate deviation from target zone
    deviation = calculate_deviation(hand_position, hand_orientation)

    // Map deviation to haptic signal
    haptic_signal = map_deviation_to_haptic_signal(deviation)

    // Apply haptic signal to array
    apply_haptic_signal(haptic_signal)

    // Repeat
```
