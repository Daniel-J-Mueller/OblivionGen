## Personalized Replenishment Bundles

**System Overview:**

The system extends automatic replenishment to proactively suggest *bundles* of related consumable products, adapting to evolving consumer needs beyond single-item reordering. It incorporates a 'lifestyle drift' detection mechanism to identify changes in consumer behavior, indicating the need for revised bundle recommendations.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Data Collection:**
    *   Tracks purchase history (items, frequency, quantity).
    *   Monitors ancillary data: calendar integrations (travel, events), location data (home, work, gym – with explicit consent), connected device usage (smart home, wearables).
    *   Analyzes product usage patterns. (e.g. if coffee consumption increases during work-from-home periods).

2.  **Lifestyle Drift Detection:**
    *   Employs a time-series analysis algorithm (e.g. Kalman filter) to model baseline consumption patterns for each product category.
    *   Calculates a ‘drift score’ based on deviations from the baseline. Significant drift triggers a re-evaluation of bundle recommendations.
    *   Drift can be ‘positive’ (increased consumption) or ‘negative’ (decreased consumption).

3.  **Bundle Recommendation Engine:**
    *   Utilizes a collaborative filtering and content-based filtering hybrid approach.
    *   Identifies products frequently purchased together (collaborative filtering).
    *   Analyzes product attributes and consumer preferences (content-based filtering).
    *   Prioritizes bundles based on predicted consumption rate, drift score, and user-defined preferences.

4.  **Dynamic Bundle Adjustment:**
    *   Bundles are not static. The system dynamically adjusts bundle contents based on:
        *   Real-time consumption data.
        *   Lifestyle drift detection.
        *   User feedback (explicit ratings, implicit behavior).
        *   Seasonal trends.

5. **Proactive Suggestion Interface:**
    * Interface is presented as a notification on a smart display or mobile app.
    * Includes a 'bundle preview' with estimated consumption rates and delivery timelines.
    * Offers a 'customization' option allowing users to adjust bundle contents.
    * Allows users to temporarily pause or skip bundles.

**Pseudocode – Bundle Recommendation Algorithm**

```
FUNCTION RecommendBundle(consumerID)

    // 1. Fetch historical purchase data
    purchaseHistory = GetPurchaseHistory(consumerID)

    // 2. Fetch ancillary data (calendar, location, device usage)
    ancillaryData = GetAncillaryData(consumerID)

    // 3. Calculate Lifestyle Drift Score
    driftScore = CalculateDriftScore(purchaseHistory, ancillaryData)

    // 4. Identify Potential Bundle Items
    potentialItems = GetPotentialBundleItems(consumerID, purchaseHistory)

    // 5. Calculate Bundle Affinity Score
    FOR each item IN potentialItems
        affinityScore = CalculateAffinityScore(item, consumerID, driftScore) //Considers purchase history, drift, user preferences
    ENDFOR

    // 6. Sort Bundle Items by Affinity Score
    sortedItems = SortItemsByAffinity(sortedItems)

    // 7. Select Top N Items for Bundle
    bundleItems = SelectTopNItems(sortedItems, N)

    // 8. Calculate Estimated Consumption Rate for Bundle
    estimatedConsumptionRate = CalculateEstimatedConsumptionRate(bundleItems, consumerID)

    // 9. Present Bundle to User
    DisplayBundle(bundleItems, estimatedConsumptionRate)

    RETURN bundleItems
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateDriftScore(purchaseHistory, ancillaryData)
    // Time-series analysis of consumption patterns
    // Compares current consumption to baseline
    // Incorporates data from ancillary sources
    RETURN driftScore
END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Smart display or mobile app for user interface.
*   Connectivity to consumer’s calendar, location services, and connected devices (with consent).
*   Data storage for purchase history and ancillary data.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Time-series analysis algorithms (e.g., Kalman filter).
*   Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms.
*   Machine learning models for predicting consumption rates and user preferences.
*   Secure data storage and privacy protection mechanisms.
