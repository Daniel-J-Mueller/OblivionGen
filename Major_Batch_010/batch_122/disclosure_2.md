## Autonomous Mobile Device – Spatial Audio Reflection Mapping

**Concept:** Utilize the AMD's speakers to emit short bursts of sound, then leverage the camera and onboard processing to map reflective surfaces based on the *audible* reflections, augmenting or replacing visual mapping in low-visibility conditions or to detect surfaces outside the direct field of view.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   AMD equipped with an array of small, directional speakers (minimum 4, optimally 8+). Speakers should be capable of emitting frequencies between 20Hz-20kHz.
    *   High-sensitivity microphone array (minimum 4, optimally 8+) synchronized with the speaker array.
    *   Existing camera system from patent (for data fusion).
    *   Dedicated digital signal processor (DSP) for audio processing.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Sound Emission:**  The system sequentially activates each speaker, emitting a short, broadband “chirp” signal. The timing and sequence are logged.
    2.  **Audio Capture:**  The microphone array captures the emitted chirp *and* any reflections.
    3.  **Time-of-Flight (TOF) Calculation (Audio):**  For each microphone, the DSP calculates the time difference between the emitted chirp and its reflected arrival. This yields a preliminary distance estimate to the reflecting surface.
    4.  **Directional Analysis:** The microphone array analyzes the direction of arrival of the reflected sound using beamforming techniques. This establishes a vector pointing towards the reflecting surface.
    5.  **Ray Tracing & Surface Estimation:**  The system utilizes a simplified ray tracing algorithm.  Given the speaker position, the emission time, the arrival time at each microphone, and the direction of arrival, the algorithm estimates the location, orientation, and size of the reflecting surface.  Multiple reflections are accounted for.
    6.  **Data Fusion:**  The estimated surface data is fused with the visual map generated by the camera system.  Discrepancies are flagged, and a confidence level is assigned to each surface. Surfaces detected solely through audio are assigned lower confidence.
    7.  **Occupancy Map Update:** The occupancy map is updated with the fused data, incorporating the location, orientation, and confidence level of the detected surfaces.  
    8.  **Dynamic Adaptation:**  The system monitors the environment and dynamically adjusts the speaker sequence, chirp frequency, and processing parameters based on the detected acoustic characteristics of the space.
*   **Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
FOR each speaker IN speaker_array:
    Emit chirp signal FROM speaker
    FOR each microphone IN microphone_array:
        Record audio FROM microphone
        Calculate TOF (Time-of-Flight)
        Calculate Direction of Arrival
        Estimate reflection surface parameters (location, orientation, size)

    Fuse estimated surface parameters with visual map data
    Update occupancy map with fused data

END
```

*   **Expansion Possibilities:**
    *   **Material Identification:** Analyze the frequency response of the reflected sound to infer the material composition of the surface (e.g., wood, metal, glass).
    *   **Hidden Object Detection:**  Detect objects behind obstacles by analyzing subtle sound reflections.
    *   **Advanced Acoustic Modeling:** Incorporate more complex acoustic models to account for factors such as temperature, humidity, and air pressure.
    *    **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Enable multiple AMDs to collaboratively map a space using synchronized sound emissions and data sharing.
