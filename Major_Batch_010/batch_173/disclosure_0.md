## Adaptive Commentary Layer & Dynamic Scene Selection

**Concept:** Extend synchronized video viewing beyond simple chat overlay. Create an adaptive commentary layer where commentary *content* is dynamically linked to specific moments *within* the video. Furthermore, allow users to collaboratively 'remix' video streams by collectively selecting alternative scenes or edits, creating a branching, user-defined viewing experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Scene Segmentation & Tagging Module:**

*   **Function:** Analyze video content to automatically segment it into distinct scenes. Employ object recognition, audio analysis (speech detection, music cues), and motion detection to identify scene boundaries.
*   **Output:** A timestamped scene index. Each scene entry includes:
    *   Start Time (seconds)
    *   End Time (seconds)
    *   Visual Keyframes (3-5 representative images)
    *   Audio Signature (a hash representing dominant audio features)
    *   Object Tags (e.g., "car", "person", "building")
    *   Action Tags (e.g., “running”, “speaking”, “explosion”)

**2. Commentary Anchor System:**

*   **Function:** Allow users to create commentary segments anchored to specific timestamps *within* the video.
*   **Data Structure:**
    *   Commentary ID (unique identifier)
    *   User ID (creator of commentary)
    *   Timestamp (seconds) - Precise moment the commentary applies to.
    *   Commentary Text (string)
    *   Commentary Type (e.g., text, audio, video clip)
    *   Visibility: Public, Friends Only, Private
    *   Sentiment Analysis: Automatically detect the emotional tone of commentary (positive, negative, neutral).

**3. Dynamic Commentary Layer:**

*   **Function:** Render commentary segments *synchronously* with the video playback.
*   **Rendering Logic:**
    *   As the video plays, compare the current playback time with the timestamps of available commentary segments.
    *   When a match is found (within a small tolerance – e.g., +/- 0.5 seconds), display the corresponding commentary.
    *   Display multiple simultaneous commentaries (if they overlap in time). Allow users to filter commentary by user, sentiment, or type.
    *   Commentaries should be visually unobtrusive (e.g., a subtle overlay, a scrolling ticker).

**4. Collaborative Scene Selection Module:**

*   **Function:** Allow users to collectively vote on alternative scene transitions or edits.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   At designated "decision points" in the video (pre-defined or dynamically detected), present users with multiple scene options (e.g., alternative camera angles, different edits of the same scene).
    *   Users vote on their preferred option.
    *   The system seamlessly transitions to the selected scene.
    *   The branching video path is recorded, allowing for the creation of unique, user-defined video experiences.
*   **Data Structure:**
    *   Decision Point ID (unique identifier)
    *   Current Time (seconds)
    *   Scene Options (list of video segment IDs with start/end times)
    *   Vote Counts (for each scene option)
    *   Selected Scene ID (after voting is complete)

**5. User Interface:**

*   Integrated control panel for:
    *   Creating/editing commentary segments.
    *   Voting on scene selections.
    *   Filtering commentary.
    *   Adjusting video playback settings.
*   Real-time visualization of commentary and voting activity.

**Pseudocode (Scene Selection):**

```
function process_video_frame(current_time) {
  // Check if current_time matches a Decision Point ID
  if (is_decision_point(current_time)) {
    // Get scene options for this decision point
    scene_options = get_scene_options(current_time);

    // Display scene options to users
    display_scene_options(scene_options);

    // Wait for user votes

    // Tally votes

    // Select scene with most votes

    // Transition to selected scene

    // Record branching path
  } else {
    // Play standard video content
  }
}
```
