## Dynamic Trust Scoring with Ephemeral Credentials

**Concept:** Extend the burst cluster authentication paradigm to incorporate a dynamic trust scoring system for inter-cluster communication, combined with frequently rotating, narrowly scoped credentials. This moves beyond simple validation of a shared secret to a continuous assessment of cluster reliability and authorization.

**Specifications:**

**1. Trust Score Calculation:**

*   **Data Sources:** Each cluster maintains a trust score for every other cluster it interacts with. Factors influencing this score:
    *   **Response Time:**  Average latency of requests.
    *   **Data Integrity:** Validation of data received (checksums, digital signatures).
    *   **Resource Usage:**  Monitoring of resource requests (CPU, memory, bandwidth).
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identification of unusual patterns in communication.
    *   **Reputation Services:** Integration with external or internal reputation data feeds.
*   **Score Weighting:** A configurable weighting system assigns importance to each factor.  Administrators can adjust these weights based on security and performance priorities.
*   **Decay Mechanism:** Trust scores decay over time if no communication occurs. This prevents stale scores from influencing decisions.
*   **Thresholds:**  Predefined trust score thresholds determine authorization levels (e.g., access to sensitive data, ability to initiate requests).

**2. Ephemeral Credential Generation & Rotation:**

*   **Credential Type:**  Utilize a time-bound, digitally signed JWT (JSON Web Token) as the primary credential.
*   **Scope Definition:**  Each JWT explicitly defines the permitted actions and resources the requesting cluster can access. (e.g. “read access to table X”, “execute query Y”)
*   **Rotation Frequency:**  Rotate JWTs every *n* minutes (configurable parameter). Rotation should be *automatic*.
*   **Distribution Method:**  Integrate with the existing burst cluster request process. The burst service manager issues the initial JWT along with the shared secret.  Subsequent JWTs are automatically exchanged via a secure channel.
*   **Revocation Mechanism:**  Implement a fast revocation system.  Invalidated JWTs are immediately rejected by receiving clusters.

**3. Secure Communication Protocol Enhancement:**

*   **Protocol:** Utilize TLS 1.3 with mutual authentication (client and server certificates).
*   **Credential Verification:** Receiving clusters verify the JWT signature, expiration time, and scope before processing any requests.
*   **Trust Score Integration:** Before honoring a request, the receiving cluster *also* checks the trust score of the requesting cluster.
    *   If the trust score is below a defined threshold, the request is denied *even if* the JWT is valid.
    *   The request may be logged for audit and investigation.
*   **Adaptive Security:**  Dynamically adjust security parameters (e.g., JWT lifetime, trust score thresholds) based on detected threats or anomalies.

**Pseudocode (Receiving Cluster – Request Processing):**

```
function processRequest(request, jwt) {
  // 1. Verify JWT Signature and Expiration
  if (!verifyJwt(jwt)) {
    log("Invalid JWT");
    return error("Invalid JWT");
  }

  // 2. Check Request Scope
  if (!hasPermission(jwt, request.action, request.resource)) {
    log("Permission Denied");
    return error("Permission Denied");
  }

  // 3. Retrieve Trust Score for Requesting Cluster
  trustScore = getTrustScore(request.clusterId);

  // 4. Check Trust Score against Threshold
  if (trustScore < minTrustScoreThreshold) {
    log("Trust Score Too Low");
    return error("Trust Violation");
  }

  // 5. Process Request
  result = performAction(request);

  // 6. Update Trust Score (based on success/failure)
  updateTrustScore(request.clusterId, result);

  return result;
}
```

**System Components:**

*   **Trust Score Manager:** A dedicated service responsible for calculating, storing, and managing trust scores.
*   **Credential Authority:** A service responsible for generating and signing JWTs.
*   **Burst Service Manager (Modified):**  Handles initial JWT issuance.
*   **Burst Proxy (Modified):**  Participates in JWT exchange.
*   **Each Cluster:**  Includes agents for Trust Score Management, Credential Verification, and secure communication.
