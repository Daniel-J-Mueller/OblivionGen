## Adaptive Data Partitioning via Simulated Annealing

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust data partitioning *after* initial query processing begins, guided by a simulated annealing algorithm, to optimize resource utilization and reduce latency. The initial partitioning from the patent is treated as a starting point, then refined in real-time.

**Specs:**

1.  **Real-Time Performance Monitoring:** Integrate performance counters (CPU usage, memory access, network latency) for each node involved in query processing. These counters will serve as the 'energy' function in the simulated annealing algorithm.

2.  **Data Partitioning Graph:** Represent the data partitioning as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Nodes in the DAG represent data shards. Edges represent data dependencies and data flow between shards. The initial DAG is derived from the described hierarchical node structure.

3.  **Move Operators:** Define a set of ‘move’ operators to modify the DAG. These operators include:
    *   **Shard Migration:** Moving a shard from one node to another.
    *   **Shard Splitting:** Dividing a shard into two smaller shards.
    *   **Shard Merging:** Combining two shards into a single shard.
    *   **Re-Parenting:** Changing the parent-child relationships between nodes in the hierarchical structure.

4.  **Energy Function:** Define an energy function based on real-time performance monitoring. The energy function should consider:
    *   Node CPU utilization (higher utilization = higher energy)
    *   Node memory access latency (higher latency = higher energy)
    *   Network latency between nodes (higher latency = higher energy)
    *   Data transfer volume between nodes (higher volume = higher energy)

5.  **Simulated Annealing Algorithm:** Implement the simulated annealing algorithm with the following parameters:
    *   **Initial Temperature:** A high initial temperature to allow for greater exploration of the solution space.
    *   **Cooling Schedule:** A cooling schedule that gradually reduces the temperature over time.
    *   **Acceptance Probability:** A probability function that determines whether to accept a move that increases the energy.
    *   **Iteration Count:** A maximum number of iterations to prevent the algorithm from running indefinitely.

6.  **Online Adaptation:** Run the simulated annealing algorithm continuously in the background while queries are being processed. Adapt the data partitioning in real-time based on the current performance measurements.

7.  **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a conflict resolution mechanism to handle concurrent modifications to the data partitioning. Use optimistic locking or other techniques to ensure data consistency.

8.  **Rollback Mechanism:** Implement a rollback mechanism to revert to a previous data partitioning configuration if the current configuration leads to performance degradation.

9.  **Dynamic Thresholds:**  Utilize dynamically adjusted thresholds for node capacity and performance, factoring in historical data and predictive modeling to refine the annealing process.

**Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Initialize data partitioning graph (DAG)
DAG = initial_partitioning()

// Set initial temperature and cooling rate
temperature = initial_temperature
cooling_rate = 0.95

// Main loop
while temperature > min_temperature:
  // Propose a move (shard migration, splitting, merging, re-parenting)
  new_DAG = propose_move(DAG)

  // Calculate energy of current and new DAG
  current_energy = calculate_energy(DAG)
  new_energy = calculate_energy(new_DAG)

  // Calculate energy difference
  energy_difference = new_energy - current_energy

  // Accept the move with a certain probability
  if energy_difference < 0 or random() < exp(-energy_difference / temperature):
    DAG = new_DAG

  // Reduce temperature
  temperature = temperature * cooling_rate

  // Monitor performance and adjust thresholds if necessary
  monitor_performance(DAG)
  adjust_thresholds()

// Return the optimized data partitioning graph
return DAG
```
