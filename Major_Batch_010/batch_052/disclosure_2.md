## Dynamic Content Layering with Environmental Awareness

**Concept:** Expand the dynamic content layering beyond screen size and other layers to incorporate real-world environmental data into the display rules. This allows for content adaptation that’s contextually relevant *beyond* the device, creating a more immersive and personalized experience.

**Specs:**

1.  **Environmental Data Integration Module:**
    *   Input: Access to real-time environmental data streams (via APIs or direct sensor integration). Examples:
        *   Ambient Light Level
        *   Geolocation (latitude/longitude)
        *   Weather Conditions (temperature, precipitation, wind speed)
        *   Time of Day
        *   Nearby Points of Interest (POI) - determined via geolocation
        *   Local Events (concerts, sporting events) - determined via geolocation/event APIs
    *   Processing:  Normalizes and categorizes the incoming environmental data.  Creates a “Context Profile” – a structured data representation of the surrounding environment.  
    *   Output: Context Profile – passed to the Display Rule Engine.

2.  **Extended Display Rule Engine:**
    *   Input: Content-Scalable Dynamic Content Modules, Context Profile.
    *   Processing:  Expands the existing display rule evaluation to include conditions based on the Context Profile. Example Rules:
        *   `IF Ambient Light Level < 30 lux THEN Increase Brightness of Image Layer by 20%`
        *   `IF Weather Condition = "Rain" THEN Display Umbrella Advertisement Module`
        *   `IF Geolocation within 500m of Coffee Shop THEN Display Coffee Shop Promotion Module`
        *   `IF Time of Day BETWEEN 7:00 AM AND 9:00 AM THEN Prioritize News Headline Layer`
        *   `IF Nearby POI = "Gym" THEN Display Fitness Related Advertisement`
    *   Output: Modified Content-Scalable Dynamic Content Modules with adjusted layer properties (opacity, position, content selection) based on the environmental rules.

3.  **Content Module Metadata:**
    *   Each Content-Scalable Dynamic Content Module will include metadata tags indicating its relevance to specific environmental conditions.  Example tags:
        *   `Relevance: Weather:Rain`
        *   `Relevance: TimeOfDay:Morning`
        *   `Relevance: Location:CoffeeShop`
        *   `Relevance: LightLevel:Low`
    *   The Display Rule Engine will use these metadata tags to prioritize and select appropriate content modules based on the current Context Profile.

**Pseudocode (Display Rule Engine)**

```
FUNCTION EvaluateDisplayRules(ContentModules, ContextProfile):
  FilteredModules = []
  FOR EACH Module IN ContentModules:
    IF Module.Relevance CONTAINS ContextProfile.Data THEN
      Append Module TO FilteredModules
    END IF
  END FOR

  SortedModules = Sort(FilteredModules, by: Priority based on ContextProfile match strength)

  FOR EACH Module IN SortedModules:
    Apply Layer Adjustments based on ContextProfile Rules (e.g., brightness, opacity, position)
  END FOR

  RETURN Modified ContentModules
```

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond simply adapting to *device* characteristics (screen size, orientation) and actively incorporates the *external* world into the content display. This creates a richer, more contextual user experience that feels more personalized and relevant.  The metadata tagging system allows for flexible content creation and adaptation, enabling a wide range of environmental-aware content possibilities.
