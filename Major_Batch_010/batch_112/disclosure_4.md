## Dynamic Citation Contextualization

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple citation matching to assess *how* a source is being used within the author's work. This goes beyond flagging potential plagiarism to offer nuanced feedback on argumentation and synthesis.

**Specs:**

1.  **Semantic Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Author-submitted text segment *containing* a citation, and the cited source's text.
    *   Process: Employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to determine the *semantic role* of the cited source within the author’s text.  Roles include:
        *   **Supporting Evidence:** Author uses source to *directly* support a claim.
        *   **Counterpoint/Critique:** Author uses source to present an opposing view, then rebuts it.
        *   **Methodology/Procedure:**  Author describes *how* the cited source conducted research.
        *   **Background/Context:** Source provides general information related to the topic.
        *   **Definition/Explanation:** Source defines a concept used in the author’s work.
    *   Output:  A “semantic role” tag associated with the citation.  Confidence score for each tag.

2.  **Contextual Feedback Generator:**
    *   Input: Semantic role tag, original author text, cited source text.
    *   Process:
        *   If Semantic Role = Supporting Evidence: Verify that the author's claim is *actually* supported by the cited text. Flag discrepancies.
        *   If Semantic Role = Counterpoint/Critique: Verify that the author provides a *meaningful* rebuttal.  Flag if rebuttal is weak or absent.
        *   If Semantic Role = Methodology: Flag if the author misinterprets or misrepresents the methodology.
        *   For *all* roles: Analyze the *length* of the author's discussion compared to the cited source.  Highlight if the author merely paraphrases without substantial original thought.
    *   Output: Contextual feedback messages, displayed alongside the citation in the author's document. Examples:
        *   "The cited source does not directly support your claim.  Consider revising or providing additional evidence."
        *   "Your rebuttal to the cited source is weak. Consider strengthening your argument or providing further justification."
        *   "This section largely paraphrases the cited source. Consider adding more original analysis or insight."

3.  **Citation Style Integration:**
    *   System should integrate with existing citation management tools (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley) to automatically apply contextual feedback as the author writes.
    *   Allow the author to customize the level of feedback (e.g., "strict," "moderate," "light").

**Pseudocode:**

```
function analyze_citation(author_text, cited_source_text):
  semantic_role = LLM.determine_semantic_role(author_text, cited_source_text)
  feedback = ""

  if semantic_role == "Supporting Evidence":
    if not LLM.claim_supported_by_evidence(author_text, cited_source_text):
      feedback = "Claim not fully supported by evidence."
  elif semantic_role == "Counterpoint/Critique":
    if not LLM.rebuttal_strong(author_text, cited_source_text):
      feedback = "Rebuttal may be weak."

  return feedback
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance computing infrastructure for running LLMs.
*   Access to a large corpus of academic literature for training the LLM.
*   Integration with existing citation management software.
*   User-friendly interface for displaying feedback and customizing settings.
