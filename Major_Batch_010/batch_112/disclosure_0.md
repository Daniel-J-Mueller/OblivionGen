**Adaptive Object Prefetching based on Predictive Access Patterns**

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This system augments the existing object caching infrastructure with a predictive prefetching layer. Instead of simply responding to read requests, it anticipates future requests based on learned access patterns and proactively fetches objects into the cache. This aims to reduce latency and improve overall system responsiveness, especially in scenarios with predictable data access.

**II. Components:**

1.  **Access Pattern Analyzer (APA):** A module running alongside the Object Gateway Management Service. It passively monitors read requests, capturing data such as object identifiers, request timestamps, and originating compute instance identifiers.

2.  **Predictive Model Trainer (PMT):** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, Long Short-Term Memory network) that learns sequential access patterns from the data collected by the APA.  The model predicts the probability of future object requests based on historical sequences.

3.  **Prefetching Manager (PFM):** A component responsible for translating the predictions from the PMT into prefetch requests. It manages a prefetch queue and prioritizes requests based on prediction confidence, available cache space, and network bandwidth.

4.  **Cache Controller Enhancement:** Modifications to the existing Object Gateway instance to accept and manage prefetch requests, prioritizing them appropriately (potentially lower priority than synchronous read requests).

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  The APA continuously monitors incoming read requests.
2.  Collected access pattern data is fed into the PMT.
3.  The PMT trains and updates a predictive model, identifying sequential access patterns.
4.  Based on the model, the PMT generates predictions of future object requests.
5.  The PFM receives the predictions and creates prefetch requests for the predicted objects.
6.  Prefetch requests are added to a queue, prioritized based on prediction confidence and system resources.
7.  The Cache Controller Enhancement handles prefetch requests, fetching objects from the Object Store and caching them.
8.  When a compute instance requests a pre-fetched object, it is served directly from the cache with minimal latency.

**IV. Pseudocode (Prefetching Manager):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION process_prediction(prediction_data):
  object_id = prediction_data.object_id
  confidence_score = prediction_data.confidence_score

  prefetch_request = create_prefetch_request(object_id)
  prefetch_request.priority = calculate_priority(confidence_score, available_cache_space, network_bandwidth)

  add_to_prefetch_queue(prefetch_request)

FUNCTION calculate_priority(confidence_score, cache_space, bandwidth):
  // Weighted sum of factors
  priority = (confidence_score * weight_confidence) + (cache_space * weight_cache) + (bandwidth * weight_bandwidth)
  RETURN priority

FUNCTION add_to_prefetch_queue(request):
  prefetch_queue.add(request, request.priority)
```

**V. Configuration Parameters:**

*   `prediction_interval`: The time window for collecting access pattern data.
*   `model_update_frequency`: How often the predictive model is retrained.
*   `cache_capacity_threshold`: Minimum cache capacity required to initiate prefetching.
*   `prefetch_queue_size`: Maximum number of prefetch requests allowed in the queue.
*   `weight_confidence`, `weight_cache`, `weight_bandwidth`:  Weights for factors influencing prefetch priority.
