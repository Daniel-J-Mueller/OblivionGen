## Dynamic Event Payload Morphing

**Concept:** Extend the event system to allow event payloads to be dynamically modified *in transit* based on contextual rules applied at intermediary nodes within the visual scripting graph. This goes beyond simple data access; it allows altering the very structure and content of an event message before it reaches its final handler.

**Specifications:**

*   **Morph Nodes:** Introduce new nodes to the visual scripting interface labeled "Morph Nodes." These nodes sit *between* event emitters and receivers.
*   **Morph Rules:**  Each Morph Node contains a "Rule Set" editor. The editor defines rules that specify how the event payload should be transformed. Rules are based on:
    *   **Payload Content:** Conditional logic based on existing data within the payload. (e.g., "If `playerHealth` < 20, add a `criticalState` flag.")
    *   **Contextual Data:** Access to game state information (e.g., current level, time of day, player inventory) available to the scripting environment.
    *   **External Data:** Ability to query external data sources (e.g., database, web service) to augment or modify the payload.
*   **Payload Schema Definition:**  Introduce a system for defining schemas for event payloads. This is not strictly enforced (for flexibility), but provides a baseline for type checking and rule creation.  Schemas can be defined in a simple JSON format.
*   **Dynamic Schema Extension:** Morph Nodes should be capable of adding *new* fields to the payload based on the rules, effectively extending the schema on-the-fly.
*   **Payload Cloning:** Before applying a Morph Rule, the payload *must* be cloned. This prevents unintended side effects on other event handlers listening for the same event.
*   **Error Handling:** Morph Nodes should have robust error handling. If a rule fails to apply, the node logs the error and either:
    *   Passes the original payload untouched (default behavior).
    *   Discards the event entirely (configurable).
*   **Debugging Tools:** Visual scripting interface includes a "Payload Inspector" that allows developers to:
    *   Step through event flow and inspect payloads at each Morph Node.
    *   Visualize the effect of each Morph Rule.

**Pseudocode (Morph Node Execution):**

```
function ExecuteMorph(event, morphRules, gameState, externalData) {
  payload = event.payload;
  clonedPayload = deepClone(payload); // Crucial

  for each rule in morphRules {
    if (rule.condition(clonedPayload, gameState, externalData)) {
      clonedPayload = rule.apply(clonedPayload, gameState, externalData);
    }
  }

  event.payload = clonedPayload; // Replace payload

  return event;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Adaptive Gameplay:** Modify event data based on player skill level or game difficulty.
*   **Contextual Storytelling:** Dynamically inject narrative elements into event payloads based on player choices and world state.
*   **Modular System Design:** Simplify communication between complex systems by allowing them to send generic event payloads that are transformed into specific formats by Morph Nodes.
*   **Security:** Filter or sanitize event data before it reaches sensitive handlers.
