## Dynamic Launch Configuration Inheritance & Drift Detection

**Concept:** Extend launch configurations beyond simple parameter sets to encompass hierarchical inheritance and runtime drift detection. This enables automated configuration management and proactive issue resolution in multi-tenant environments.

**Specifications:**

**1. Configuration Hierarchy:**

*   **Data Structure:** Represent launch configurations as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Nodes represent configuration sets, and edges represent inheritance relationships (e.g., a “base” config inherited by “developer” and “production” configs).
*   **Inheritance Resolution:** When a launch request arrives, the system traverses the DAG to resolve the effective configuration.  Priority is assigned to the requesting user/group, and inheritance is followed until a terminal node is reached.
*   **Versioning:** Each configuration node must be versioned. This facilitates rollbacks and audits.
*   **API Endpoint:** `/configurations/resolve` – Takes user ID, instance type, and optional overrides. Returns the fully resolved configuration (parameter list) and the path traversed in the DAG.

**2. Runtime Drift Detection:**

*   **Baseline Capture:** When an instance is launched, the *actual* configuration used is captured and stored (e.g., instance metadata, security group rules, IAM roles). This becomes the “golden configuration” for that instance.
*   **Periodic Audits:** A background process periodically audits running instances. This audit compares the captured “golden configuration” against the currently resolved launch configuration.
*   **Drift Metrics:**  Calculate “drift scores” based on differences detected during the audit.  Different parameter types can have different weights. (e.g. Security group changes are critical, while instance type changes are less so).
*   **Remediation Actions:**
    *   **Alerting:**  Raise alerts when drift exceeds a configurable threshold.
    *   **Automatic Rollback:**  Automatically revert the instance to the “golden configuration” (where feasible – security group adjustments, etc).
    *   **Configuration Sync:**  Force a configuration sync, updating the running instance to match the current launch configuration.
*   **API Endpoint:** `/instances/{instance_id}/drift` – Returns drift score, detected differences, and remediation status.

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   **Data Store:** Graph database (e.g., Neo4j) for configuration hierarchy.  Relational database for instance metadata and audit logs.
*   **Eventing:**  Use a message queue (e.g., Kafka) to propagate configuration changes and trigger audits.
*   **Security:**  Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage configuration access.
*   **Pseudocode (Audit Process):**

```
function auditInstance(instanceId):
  goldenConfig = getGoldenConfig(instanceId)
  resolvedConfig = getResolvedConfig(instanceId)  // Using /configurations/resolve
  driftScore = calculateDriftScore(goldenConfig, resolvedConfig)

  if driftScore > threshold:
    log("Drift detected for instance " + instanceId + ": " + driftScore)
    remediate(instanceId)

function remediate(instanceId):
  // Attempt to revert/sync configuration
  if revertSuccessful:
    log("Instance " + instanceId + " reverted to golden configuration")
  else:
    // Raise alert/take other action
    log("Failed to revert instance " + instanceId + ". Alerting.")
```

**4. Enhancement:** Incorporate machine learning to predict configuration drift and proactively adjust configurations before issues occur.  Train a model on historical drift data.
