## Adaptive Packet Sequencing for Anomaly Detection

**Concept:** Expand upon the ring buffer approach by dynamically adjusting buffer sizes and sequencing based on observed traffic patterns, creating a temporal 'fingerprint' of network behavior. This isn't just about *how many* destinations are hit, but *when* and *in what order*.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Packet Sequence Analyzer (PSA) module, integrated with existing network monitoring infrastructure.
*   **Data Input:** Raw packet data stream.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *Dynamic Ring Buffers:*  Instead of fixed-size buffers per port, use a system where buffer sizes are automatically adjusted based on traffic volume and observed sequence lengths. This allows the system to ‘zoom in’ on bursts of activity or extended scanning sessions.
    *   *Sequence Trees:*  A tree-like data structure to represent observed packet sequences. Each node represents a destination port. The path from the root (source) to a leaf node represents a complete sequence. Branch probabilities are stored at each node.
    *   *Temporal Profiles:*  For each source IP, maintain a profile capturing the distribution of inter-packet times, sequence lengths, and common sequence patterns.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  *Packet Capture & Preprocessing:* Capture packets and extract source/destination IP/port information.
    2.  *Sequence Building:*
        *   For each source IP, construct a sequence of destination ports based on packet arrival order.
        *   Update the Sequence Tree with the observed sequence, incrementing node counts and branch probabilities.
    3.  *Dynamic Buffer Allocation:*
        *   Monitor sequence lengths for each source.
        *   Increase buffer size if sequences are consistently long, suggesting a scan.
        *   Decrease buffer size if sequences are short and intermittent.
    4.  *Anomaly Detection:*
        *   Calculate the probability of an observed sequence based on the Sequence Tree and Temporal Profiles.
        *   Flag sequences with low probability as anomalous.
        *   Thresholds for probability and sequence length are dynamically adjusted based on network baseline.
*   **Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```pseudocode
function detectAnomaly(sourceIP, destinationSequence):
  sequenceProbability = 1.0
  for i = 0 to length(destinationSequence) - 1:
    currentPort = destinationSequence[i]
    if (port exists in Sequence Tree for sourceIP):
      sequenceProbability *= getBranchProbability(sourceIP, currentPort)
    else:
      sequenceProbability = 0.0  // Unknown port sequence
      break
  if (sequenceProbability < anomalyThreshold):
    flag as anomalous
    return true
  else:
    return false
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:** Standard network monitoring hardware with sufficient processing power and memory to handle the increased data analysis load.
*   **Software Requirements:** Programming language capable of efficient data structure manipulation (e.g., C++, Python). Existing network monitoring software integration API.
*   **Output:** Alerts indicating potential port scans based on anomalous sequence detection. Detailed sequence data for forensic analysis.
*   **Novelty:** Existing systems focus primarily on the *quantity* of connections. This system leverages *temporal ordering* to identify scans that may otherwise be missed. Dynamic buffer allocation optimizes resource usage.
