## Biometric Synchronization & Dynamic OTP Generation

**Concept:** Instead of relying solely on synchronized OTPs displayed on a separate user device, integrate biometric authentication *into* the OTP generation process on the card reader itself. This creates a dynamic, multi-factor authentication system significantly harder to spoof.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Integrated capacitive fingerprint scanner on the card reader (location: where a user naturally grips the device). Minimum resolution: 500 DPI.
    *   Secure Enclave: Dedicated, tamper-resistant hardware module for biometric data storage and processing.
    *   Real-Time Clock (RTC): High-precision RTC for accurate time-based OTP generation.
    *   Low-Power Bluetooth Module: For initial pairing and occasional synchronization with a trusted device.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Biometric Enrollment: Secure enrollment process capturing and encrypting fingerprint data within the Secure Enclave.  Maximum allowed enrollment attempts: 5.
    *   Dynamic OTP Algorithm: Combines:
        *   Time-based OTP (TOTP) - standard TOTP generation.
        *   Biometric Signature: Unique hash derived from the fingerprint scan performed *at the moment* of OTP generation.
        *   Device Identifier: Unique hardware ID of the card reader.
    *   Synchronization Protocol:
        *   Initial Pairing:  Bluetooth pairing with a user's smartphone/tablet.
        *   Secure Key Exchange:  Establish a secure communication channel using Elliptic-Curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECDH) key exchange.
        *   Token Storage: Encrypted token stored on the paired device. Not a static OTP, but a cryptographic key used in conjunction with the card reader's biometric OTP.
    *   Transaction Protocol:
        1.  User initiates transaction.
        2.  Card reader prompts for fingerprint scan.
        3.  If scan matches, card reader generates a dynamic OTP.
        4.  The OTP and a signed transaction request are sent to the payment processor.
        5.  The payment processor verifies the signature and validates the transaction.

**Pseudocode (OTP Generation):**

```
function generate_otp():
    fingerprint_scan = scan_fingerprint()
    if fingerprint_scan == null:
        return "Authentication Failed"
    
    current_time = get_current_time()
    device_id = get_device_id()
    
    biometric_hash = hash(fingerprint_scan, device_id)
    otp_seed = hash(current_time, biometric_hash)
    
    otp = totp(otp_seed)
    
    return otp
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Liveness Detection:** Implement liveness detection algorithms (e.g., pulse oximetry, skin deformation analysis) to prevent spoofing with fake fingerprints.
*   **Dynamic Biometric Template Update:** Periodically update the stored biometric template with new fingerprint scans to account for changes in fingerprint characteristics (e.g., due to wear and tear, injuries).
*   **Secure Boot:** Implement secure boot to ensure that the card reader firmware has not been tampered with.
