## Dynamic Cart Subdivision & Robotic Swarm Delivery

**Concept:** Extend the single-destination cart system with internal, dynamically configurable subdivisions *within* each cart, coupled with a swarm of miniature, cart-resident robots for final package delivery *within* a destination.

**Specifications:**

**1. Cart Internal Structure:**

*   **Modular Bay System:** Each cart contains a grid of electrically actuated dividers, creating variable-sized bays. Bay sizes are configurable *en route*.
*   **Bay Sensors:** Each bay incorporates weight sensors and potentially basic dimension sensors to track contents.
*   **Actuation:** Linear actuators (solenoids or small motors) control divider movement.  Power delivered via cart’s existing power system.
*   **Communication:**  Each bay has a short-range wireless communication module (Bluetooth Low Energy) for reporting status and receiving commands.

**2. Cart-Resident Robotic Swarm:**

*   **Robot Dimensions:** Miniature robots (approx. 10cm x 10cm x 5cm).
*   **Locomotion:**  Wheeled or tracked base for movement *within* the cart and at the destination.
*   **Payload Capacity:**  Each robot capable of carrying a single standard-sized package (or a cluster of smaller items).
*   **Navigation:**  Internal cart localization via UWB (Ultra-Wideband) or visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).  External destination navigation via pre-mapped floorplans.
*   **Communication:** Mesh network communication between robots, and with the cart’s central controller.
*   **Charging:** Wireless charging pads distributed throughout the cart’s floor.

**3. System Integration & Control:**

*   **Central Cart Controller:** A microcontroller manages bay configuration, robot assignments, and overall cart operations.
*   **Order Management System (OMS) Integration:** The OMS provides destination information and package assignments.
*   **Dynamic Bay Assignment:** Based on package destination and weight, the OMS instructs the cart controller to configure bays.
*   **Robot Assignment:** Upon arrival at the destination, the OMS assigns packages to individual robots.
*   **Robot Deployment:** Robots navigate from their assigned bay to the destination point within the building.
*   **Reverse Logistics:** Robots return to the cart for recharging/reassignment.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Robot Deployment):**

```
// On Cart Arrival at Destination
FOR EACH package IN cart.packages:
    destination = package.destination
    robot = select_available_robot()
    IF robot == null:
        WAIT_FOR_ROBOT_AVAILABILITY()
    robot.load(package)
    robot.navigate_to(destination)
    robot.unload(package)
    robot.return_to_cart()
END FOR
```

**Novelty:**  Existing systems focus on cart-level delivery. This introduces *internal* sortation and a localized delivery swarm, enabling multi-destination deliveries *within a single cart trip*, and potentially distributing deliveries within a larger facility (e.g., multiple floors in a warehouse) without requiring intermediate unloading/reloading.  The robot swarm provides a level of granularity and flexibility not present in existing systems. It addresses the 'last meter' problem within a destination efficiently.
