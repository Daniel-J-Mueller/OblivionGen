## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic biography concept to incorporate emotional state tracking of both characters *and* the user, dynamically adjusting supplemental information to heighten empathetic connection.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Electronic Media Item:  Text/script analysis for character emotional cues (sentiment analysis, keyword identification - joy, sadness, anger, fear, etc.).  Audio analysis for vocal tone and inflection.  Visual analysis (if video) for facial expressions and body language.
    *   User Device:  Real-time biometric data collection (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial expression via camera). User input (emotional reaction selections - "surprised", "sad", "angry", etc. offered as contextual prompts).
*   **Emotional State Representation:**
    *   Character Emotional Profile:  A time-series vector representing the dominant emotional state of a character at any given point in the media. Categorized into primary emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust) with intensity levels (0-1).
    *   User Emotional State:  A comparable vector representing the user’s inferred emotional state, derived from biometric data and explicit input.
*   **Resonance Algorithm:**
    *   Calculate ‘emotional distance’ between character and user emotional states (Euclidean distance in the emotional state vector space).
    *   Dynamic Adjustment of Supplemental Info:
        *   High Resonance (low emotional distance): Provide deeper character backstory, philosophical implications, or related artistic/cultural context.  Assume user is receptive to complex details.
        *   Low Resonance (high emotional distance): Provide simpler, more direct explanations of character motivations. Offer 'emotional bridging' content - short vignettes illustrating character vulnerability, or shared human experiences.
*   **Supplemental Information Types:**
    *   Character Biographies (as in the base patent).
    *   Emotional Timelines:  Visual representations of character emotional arcs.
    *   Comparative Emotion Charts: Show character emotional state versus user emotional state.
    *   Mood-Based Music/Visuals: Trigger ambient soundscapes or subtle visual effects reflecting character/user emotional alignment.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   Media Consumption Device (user device): Biometric data capture, user input collection, UI display.
    *   Resonance Engine (server-side or embedded): Emotional state analysis, resonance calculation, supplemental content selection.
    *   Content Database: Stores character biographies, emotional timelines, music/visual assets.

**Pseudocode (Resonance Engine):**

```
FUNCTION ProcessMediaFrame(media_frame, user_biometrics, current_time)

    character_emotions = AnalyzeMediaFrameForEmotions(media_frame, current_time)
    user_emotions = AnalyzeUserBiometrics(user_biometrics)

    emotional_distance = CalculateEmotionalDistance(character_emotions, user_emotions)

    IF emotional_distance < threshold_low THEN
        supplemental_content = GetAdvancedSupplementalContent(character_id, current_time)
    ELSE IF emotional_distance > threshold_high THEN
        supplemental_content = GetBridgingSupplementalContent(character_id, current_time)
    ELSE
        supplemental_content = GetStandardSupplementalContent(character_id, current_time)

    RETURN supplemental_content
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**  The core patent focuses on *what* a character is, this concept focuses on *how* the character makes the user *feel*.  It introduces real-time emotional feedback loops to personalize the viewing experience and enhance emotional connection. This moves beyond simply presenting information and towards actively shaping emotional resonance.
