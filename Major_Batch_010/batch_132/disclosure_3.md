## Adaptive Frequency Hopping based on Interference Prediction

**Specification:** A system for preemptively mitigating narrowband interference through predictive frequency hopping, leveraging historical interference data and signal characteristic analysis.

**Components:**

1.  **Interference History Module:**
    *   Data Storage: Stores a time-series database of identified interference frequencies, signal strengths, and timestamps. Resolution: 10ms granularity.
    *   Pattern Recognition: Employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) preferred – trained on historical data to predict future interference frequencies and intensities.  Output: Probability distribution of likely interference frequencies for the next 100ms.

2.  **Signal Analysis Module:**
    *   Demodulation:  Performs initial demodulation of the received signal to determine modulation scheme, data rate, and signal bandwidth.
    *   Spectral Analysis:  Analyzes the received signal's spectrum to identify inherent signal characteristics – dominant frequencies, spectral width, sideband structure.
    *   Predictive Mask Generation: Based on spectral analysis, generates a ‘mask’ representing frequency ranges crucial for signal integrity. (e.g., carrier frequency ± bandwidth/2).

3.  **Frequency Hopping Controller:**
    *   Combined Probability Input: Receives the probability distribution from the Interference History Module and the predictive mask from the Signal Analysis Module.
    *   Hopping Algorithm: Employs a weighted random selection algorithm to choose a hopping frequency.
        *   Weighting:  Higher weight assigned to frequencies *outside* of both the predicted interference regions and the critical signal frequencies defined in the mask.
        *   Hopping Rate:  Dynamically adjustable. Baseline: 10 hops/second. Adjustable range: 1-50 hops/second.
    *   Hopping Sequence Generator:  Generates a pseudo-random hopping sequence based on the selected frequency and a seed value, ensuring minimal overlap with previously used frequencies in the last 5 seconds.

4.  **Fast Frequency Switching Unit:**
    *   Hardware Implementation: Utilizes a Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) chip or a similar programmable frequency synthesizer capable of switching frequencies within 100 microseconds.
    *   Synchronization:  Synchronized with the hopping sequence generator to ensure seamless frequency transitions.

5.  **Performance Monitoring Module:**
    *   SINR Tracking: Continuously monitors the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) after each frequency hop.
    *   Adaptive Learning:  Feeds SINR data back into the RNN in the Interference History Module to refine interference prediction accuracy over time.
    *   Thresholding: Trigger an alert if SINR falls below a configurable threshold (e.g., 10dB) for more than 2 hops.



**Pseudocode (Frequency Hopping Controller):**

```pseudocode
function generate_hopping_frequency():
  interference_probabilities = get_interference_probabilities()
  signal_mask = get_signal_mask()

  weighted_frequencies = []
  for frequency in available_frequencies:
    weight = 1.0

    # Penalize frequencies within predicted interference regions
    if frequency in interference_probabilities:
      weight *= (1 - interference_probabilities[frequency])

    # Penalize frequencies outside of the signal mask
    if frequency not in signal_mask:
      weight *= 0.5

    weighted_frequencies.append((frequency, weight))

  # Normalize weights
  total_weight = sum(weight for _, weight in weighted_frequencies)
  normalized_weights = [(freq, weight / total_weight) for freq, weight in weighted_frequencies]

  # Select frequency based on weighted probability
  selected_frequency = random_choice(normalized_weights)
  return selected_frequency
```

**Operational Notes:**

*   Initial training of the RNN requires a period of observation (e.g., 24 hours) to establish a baseline interference profile.
*   The hopping rate and weighting factors are configurable parameters that can be adjusted to optimize performance in different environments.
*   The system can be integrated with existing communication protocols without requiring significant modifications.
*   Requires accurate time synchronization to maintain coherence during frequency hopping.
