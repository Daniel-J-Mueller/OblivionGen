## Haptic Directional Audio Ring

**Concept:** Expand the ring-based device into a personal spatial audio and directional haptic feedback system. Leverage the ring’s form factor to deliver localized audio and subtle vibrations, creating an immersive, hands-free experience.

**Specifications:**

*   **Ring Housing:** Maintain the core ring structure with outer/inner shells and a flexible PCB. Increase overall ring width to accommodate additional components (approx. 25mm width). Utilize a biocompatible, flexible polymer for the outer shell.
*   **Audio Emission:** Integrate miniature bone conduction transducers *around* the circumference of the inner ring surface. At least 8 independent transducers are required. These will transmit audio directly through the user’s finger bones.
*   **Haptic Actuators:** Integrate small linear resonant actuators (LRAs) between the inner and outer shells, aligned with each audio transducer. These LRAs will deliver localized vibrations.
*   **Antenna & Wireless Communication:** Maintain a curved antenna element forming part of the outer surface. Support Bluetooth 5.3 or later, with support for spatial audio codecs (e.g., Sony’s 360 Reality Audio, Dolby Atmos).
*   **Microphone Array:** Maintain microphone positioning from existing patent, supplemented by a dedicated voice activity detection (VAD) microphone on the upper surface.
*   **Power:** Curved rechargeable battery (increased capacity to support audio and haptics). Wireless charging via inner shell contact.
*   **Processing Unit:** Low-power microcontroller with dedicated DSP for audio processing and spatialization.
*   **Sensors:** 9-axis IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) for precise hand orientation tracking.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Spatial Audio Engine:** The microcontroller uses IMU data to determine hand orientation and position.  This data is used to dynamically adjust the volume and delay of each audio transducer.  This creates a localized soundscape, allowing the user to perceive sound as emanating from a specific point in space relative to their hand.
2.  **Directional Haptics:** Concurrent with audio output, the LRAs activate to deliver subtle vibrations corresponding to the perceived sound direction.  For example, if a sound is localized to the "right" side of the user’s hand, the LRAs on the right side will activate with corresponding intensity.
3.  **Voice Control:** Utilize the microphone array for voice commands and real-time speech recognition.
4.  **Gesture Control:**  Incorporate gesture recognition using the IMU data, allowing the user to control audio playback, volume, and other functions with hand movements.

**Pseudocode (Spatial Audio Engine):**

```pseudocode
// Input: IMU data (orientation: yaw, pitch, roll)
//       Audio source direction (azimuth, elevation)
//       Number of transducers (N)

function spatializeAudio(imuData, sourceDirection, N):
  // Calculate angle between user’s hand orientation and audio source
  angleDiff = calculateAngleDifference(imuData, sourceDirection)

  // Map angle difference to transducer activation levels
  transducerLevels = mapAngleToLevels(angleDiff, N)

  // Adjust volume based on distance (estimated via signal strength)
  volume = calculateVolume(signalStrength)

  // Apply transducer levels and volume to each transducer
  for i = 0 to N - 1:
    setTransducerVolume(i, transducerLevels[i] * volume)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Immersive gaming and VR/AR experiences
*   Personalized audio navigation (subtle directional cues)
*   Accessibility tool for visually impaired users
*   Hands-free communication and control
*   Biofeedback applications (subtle haptic guidance)
