**Variable Precision Modulus Accelerator**

**Concept:** Expand the modulus operation beyond fixed values like 65,521. Design a system that allows *dynamic* selection of modulus N, and simultaneously adjusts precision based on expected input ranges. This enables efficient checksumming/hashing for varied data types and sizes, while minimizing hardware resources.

**Specs:**

1.  **Input Stage:**
    *   Data Input (Din[W-1:0]):  W-bit wide data input.
    *   Modulus Width Control (MWidth[3:0]): 4-bit control signal. Defines the bit-width of the modulus N. Supported widths: 8, 16, 32, 64 bits.
    *   Expected Max Value (EMV[6:0]): 7-bit signal indicating the expected maximum value of the input data. Used for precision scaling.

2.  **Precision Scaler:**
    *   Logic:  A series of right-shifts based on EMV. If EMV indicates the data is expected to be small (e.g., < 256), right-shift Din to reduce precision and potentially speed up subsequent operations. The number of shifts is determined by a lookup table indexed by EMV.
    *   Output: Scaled Data (SD[W-1:0]).

3.  **Modulus N Generator:**
    *   Memory: A configurable memory block to store modulus N. Size determined by MWidth.
    *   Input: MWidth control signal and N data (determined by MWidth).
    *   Output: Modulus N (MN[MWidth-1:0]).

4.  **Variable Precision Adder Chain:**
    *   Configuration: Chain of adders with configurable bit-widths. Each adder can operate on different sized inputs.
    *   Input: SD and the previous adderâ€™s output.
    *   Output: Intermediate Sum (IS[W-1:0]).

5.  **Dynamic Modulus Unit:**
    *   Logic: Implements the modulus operation using a combination of subtract-and-compare cycles and bit-shifting.
    *   Input: IS and MN.
    *   Output: Modulus Result (MR[MWidth-1:0]). The unit dynamically adjusts the number of subtract-and-compare cycles based on the magnitude of IS and MN.

6.  **Output Stage:**
    *   MR is the final output.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Modulus Unit):**

```
function dynamic_modulus(IS, MN):
  result = IS
  while result >= MN:
    result = result - MN
  return result
```

**Innovations:**

*   **Dynamic Precision:** Adapts the precision of the input data based on expected ranges, minimizing computational overhead.
*   **Configurable Adder Chain:**  Enables optimized adder widths for varied data types.
*   **Programmable Modulus:** Supports arbitrary modulus N values, enhancing flexibility.
*   **Reduced Hardware:** Precision scaling and configurable adders reduce the overall hardware footprint compared to fixed-width modulus circuits.
