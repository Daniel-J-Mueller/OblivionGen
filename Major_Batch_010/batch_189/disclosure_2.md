## Dynamic Volumetric Presence – ‘Holo-Call’ System

**System Overview:**

The ‘Holo-Call’ system aims to move beyond 2D video conferencing by generating a dynamic, volumetric representation of remote participants within the local environment, creating a sense of true shared physical space. This is achieved through a combination of multi-camera arrays, real-time 3D reconstruction, and holographic projection integrated with environmental sensors and dynamic audio spatialization.

**Hardware Components:**

1.  **Multi-Camera Array (Local & Remote):** Each environment will be equipped with a minimum of 6 high-resolution, synchronized cameras arranged in a hemispherical pattern. These cameras capture comprehensive visual data of the participant and their surroundings.
2.  **Depth Sensors (Local & Remote):**  Integrated with the camera arrays, LiDAR or Time-of-Flight sensors provide precise depth information, crucial for 3D reconstruction.
3.  **Holographic Projector (Local):** A high-resolution volumetric display capable of projecting light interference patterns to create a stable, visible 3D representation of the remote participant. This could utilize spatial light modulators (SLMs) or similar holographic technology. Resolution minimum 1080x1080x720.
4.  **Environmental Sensors (Local):**  Array of sensors to map the local room geometry (IR, ultrasound, or similar) and detect obstacles, furniture, and the positions of local participants.
5.  **Spatial Audio System (Local):** A multi-speaker array (minimum 8 speakers) capable of beamforming and creating a highly localized, 3D audio experience.
6.  **Processing Unit (Local & Remote):** High-performance computing capable of real-time 3D reconstruction, rendering, and holographic projection control.  GPU minimum RTX 4090.

**Software/Algorithm Specifications:**

1.  **Real-time 3D Reconstruction:** Utilize Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or similar techniques to generate a high-fidelity 3D model of the remote participant from the multi-camera and depth sensor data.  Model updated at minimum 30fps.
2.  **Environmental Mapping & Obstacle Avoidance:** Algorithm continuously maps the local environment and identifies obstacles. The holographic projection is adjusted to avoid collisions or projection onto unintended surfaces.
3.  **Holographic Projection Control:** Software dynamically controls the holographic projector to render the 3D model of the remote participant.  Rendering includes dynamic lighting, shadowing, and textures for realism.  Rendering incorporates realistic eye movement and micro-expressions.
4.  **Dynamic Audio Spatialization:** Algorithm simulates sound propagation based on the positions of all participants (local and remote). Sound is beamformed to create a localized, 3D audio experience.  HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) personalization for each local participant.
5.  **Gaze Interaction Simulation:** Eye tracking data from the remote participant is utilized to simulate eye contact with local participants. Holographic rendering adjusts the gaze direction of the remote participant's avatar.
6.  **Avatar Customization & Expression Mapping:** Allow remote participants to customize their avatar's appearance and map their facial expressions and body language onto the avatar in real-time. Utilize machine learning algorithms for accurate expression mapping.
7.  **Data Compression & Transmission:**  Develop a highly efficient data compression algorithm to transmit 3D model data, sensor data, and audio data over a network connection. Prioritize low latency and high quality.
8.  **Calibration & Synchronization:** Implement a robust calibration and synchronization procedure to ensure accurate alignment of cameras, depth sensors, and holographic projector.
