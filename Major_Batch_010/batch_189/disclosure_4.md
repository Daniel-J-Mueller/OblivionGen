## Personalized Predictive Buffering with Emotional Valence

**Concept:** Enhance the presented quality prediction by factoring in *emotional valence* detected from the media content itself and correlating it with user physiological responses to preempt buffering events during emotionally impactful scenes.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on predicting presented quality based on device, bandwidth, and encoding. This expands that by recognizing *why* momentary buffering is more disruptive at certain points – during moments of high emotional engagement.  A momentary dip in quality during a talking head is less jarring than during a crucial action sequence.

**System Components:**

1.  **Emotional Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Media file (video/audio).
    *   Process:  Utilizes AI (computer vision & natural language processing) to analyze scenes/segments for emotional valence (e.g., joy, sadness, fear, excitement). Assigns a continuous emotional score to each fragment.
    *   Output: Emotional valence score (float between -1 and 1) per media fragment.

2.  **Physiological Data Input:**
    *   Input: Real-time user physiological data (heart rate variability, skin conductance, pupil dilation) from wearable sensors (smartwatch, VR headset, etc.).
    *   Process:  Analyzes physiological signals to detect periods of heightened emotional arousal or engagement.
    *   Output: User Emotional Engagement Score (UES) – a continuous score indicating the user's emotional response.

3.  **Predictive Buffering Controller:**
    *   Input: 
        *   Fragment-level emotional valence scores (from Emotional Analysis Module).
        *   Real-time UES (from Physiological Data Input).
        *   Existing presented quality prediction data (from the core patent system).
        *   Current network conditions (bandwidth, latency).
    *   Process:
        *   Combines the above inputs using a weighted algorithm.  Higher weights assigned to emotional valence *and* UES when predicting buffering risk.
        *   Adjusts buffering thresholds dynamically.  During emotionally critical segments (high emotional valence *and* high UES), the system becomes *more* aggressive in pre-buffering.
        *   Prioritizes pre-fetching segments with high emotional valence.
        *   May slightly reduce video resolution *before* high-emotional-valence segments to maintain consistent bandwidth.
    *   Output:  Pre-buffered media segments, adjusted video quality settings, prioritized network requests.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Buffering Controller):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateBufferingRisk(fragmentEmotionalValence, userEngagementScore, predictedQualityScore, networkBandwidth)

  // Weights (tunable parameters)
  emotionalWeight = 0.4
  engagementWeight = 0.3
  qualityWeight = 0.2
  bandwidthWeight = 0.1

  // Calculate weighted risk score
  riskScore = (emotionalWeight * fragmentEmotionalValence) + 
              (engagementWeight * userEngagementScore) + 
              (qualityWeight * predictedQualityScore) +
              (bandwidthWeight * networkBandwidth)

  // Dynamic Buffering Threshold (adjusts based on risk score)
  bufferingThreshold = baseThreshold - (riskScore * sensitivityFactor) 

  // Check if buffering is needed
  IF (predictedBandwidth < bufferingThreshold) THEN
    prebufferSegment(nextSegment)
  ENDIF

  RETURN bufferingThreshold
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `FragmentMetadata`:  {fragmentID, emotionalValence, predictedQuality, prebufferedStatus}
*   `UserPhysiologicalData`: {timestamp, heartRate, skinConductance, pupilDilation}

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Personalized emotional profiles: Learn user emotional responses over time to refine the weighting algorithm.
*   Content-aware pre-fetching:  Predict *entire* scenes that might be emotionally impactful.
*   Integration with VR/AR:  Leverage eye-tracking and foveated rendering to prioritize buffering for the user’s focus of attention.
*   Machine Learning: Train a model to predict buffering events based on all the input data, and refine the weighting algorithm using reinforcement learning.
