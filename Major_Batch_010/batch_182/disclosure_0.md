## Dynamic Exclusion Rule Generation via Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Instead of relying on *static* exclusion rules (as implied in claim 10 & 11), create a system that *predicts* item performance based on early engagement metrics, and dynamically adjusts inclusion/exclusion. This creates a self-optimizing feed, prioritizing items most likely to convert *before* significant resources are committed.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Capture raw data streams for all items: network page views, shopping cart adds, referral clicks (from all networks), initial sales, and return rates.
    *   Aggregate data *hourly* for each item.
    *   Maintain a historical database of item performance data (at least 6 months).

2.  **Predictive Model:**
    *   Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM recurrent neural network) trained on the historical data.
    *   Model should predict:
        *   Probability of sale within 24 hours.
        *   Estimated return rate (percentage).
        *   Predicted Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV).
    *   Model requires periodic retraining (weekly) to account for seasonality, trends, and evolving customer behavior.

3.  **Dynamic Exclusion Rule Engine:**
    *   Establish thresholds for each prediction metric:
        *   `SaleProbabilityThreshold`
        *   `ReturnRateThreshold`
        *   `CLTVThreshold`
    *   Implement a rule-based system that dynamically adjusts these thresholds based on overall feed performance (conversion rates, revenue). 
    *   The engine should prioritize items scoring above all thresholds.
    *   Items *below* thresholds are either excluded entirely or have their feed frequency *reduced*.
    *   Implement an A/B testing framework to continuously refine threshold values.

4.  **Feed Generation Integration:**
    *   Modify the existing feed generation process (described in claims 1, 3, 11) to incorporate the dynamic exclusion engine.
    *   Before adding an item to the feed, the engine evaluates it based on the predictive modelâ€™s output.
    *   The system should automatically adjust the number of items in the feed based on model confidence. (Lower Confidence = fewer items).

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION GenerateFeed(items):
  feed = []
  FOR item IN items:
    prediction = PredictiveModel.Predict(item)
    saleProbability = prediction.saleProbability
    returnRate = prediction.returnRate
    cltv = prediction.cltv

    IF saleProbability > SaleProbabilityThreshold AND returnRate < ReturnRateThreshold AND cltv > CLTVThreshold:
      feed.Append(item)
    ELSE:
      // Reduce feed frequency for marginal items
      IF Random() < MarginalItemFrequencyReductionRate:
        feed.Append(item)
  RETURN feed
```

**Novelty:** The core innovation lies in shifting from static exclusion rules to a *proactive, predictive* system.  Instead of reacting to past performance, the system anticipates future success, enabling more efficient allocation of resources and improved feed relevance. It introduces a level of intelligence that optimizes feed content in real-time, leading to a potentially significant increase in conversions and revenue.
