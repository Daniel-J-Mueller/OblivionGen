## Dynamic Shelf Lighting & Behavioral Prediction

**Concept:** Integrate dynamic, addressable LED lighting *within* shelving units, coupled with the existing camera/sensor network. This system will go beyond planogram verification and move into *predictive* restocking and behavioral analysis.

**Specs:**

*   **Shelf Unit Integration:** Existing and future shelving units to incorporate addressable RGB LED strips along the leading edge of each shelf, concealed within a translucent strip. Each LED is individually addressable. Power & data delivered via low-voltage cabling integrated into shelving supports.
*   **Lighting Profiles:** Pre-programmed lighting profiles linked to items via the planogram data. Example: “High-Value Item – Pulsing Blue,” “Sale Item – Rapidly Cycling Red/Yellow,” “Low Stock – Dimming Orange.” Profiles are customizable via a central management console.
*   **Sensor Fusion:** Combine camera data (item identification, shopper gaze tracking), shelf weight sensors (stock levels), and potentially RFID tags (for precise item identification) to create a ‘heat map’ of shopper interaction.
*   **Behavioral Algorithms:** AI algorithms analyze shopper gaze, dwell time, and item interaction data to predict potential purchases or restocking needs *before* the shopper physically takes the item.
*   **Dynamic Lighting Responses:**
    *   **Attract Attention:** If a shopper looks at a specific item for a prolonged period, the corresponding shelf lighting will subtly brighten or pulse, increasing visual prominence.
    *   **Guided Navigation:** If a shopper appears lost or confused (determined by gaze direction and movement patterns), the system will illuminate a path to desired items.
    *   **Low Stock Alerts:**  When stock reaches a pre-defined threshold, the shelf lighting will shift to an alerting color (e.g., flashing red).
    *   **Impulse Buy Stimulation:** For items identified as high-impulse purchases, lighting patterns can be adjusted to maximize visual appeal.
*   **Data Output:** System to generate reports on:
    *   Shopper engagement levels per item.
    *   Effectiveness of lighting patterns.
    *   Real-time stock levels.
    *   Potential lost sales due to out-of-stock items.
*   **API Integration:** Open API for integration with existing inventory management systems, digital signage, and mobile apps.

**Pseudocode (Simplified – Dynamic Lighting Adjustment):**

```
// Input: Camera data (shopper gaze direction, dwell time), Shelf weight sensor data
// Output: Lighting pattern for individual shelves

function adjustLighting(cameraData, shelfData) {
  for each shelf in shelves {
    if (item in shelf is within shopper's gaze) {
      dwellTime = calculateDwellTime(cameraData, shelf);

      if (dwellTime > thresholdHigh) {
        setShelfLighting(shelf, "PulsingBlue"); //Attract Attention
      } else if (shelf.stockLevel < thresholdLow) {
        setShelfLighting(shelf, "FlashingRed"); //Stock Alert
      } else {
        setShelfLighting(shelf, "Normal"); //Default Lighting
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**  Current systems focus on *detecting* what's on shelves. This system moves to *influencing* shopper behavior and predicting needs through dynamic environmental adjustments. The combination of targeted lighting, real-time data analysis, and predictive algorithms is a significant departure from existing technologies. It's not merely a better planogram system, but an active, intelligent retail environment.
