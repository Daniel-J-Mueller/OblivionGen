## Dynamic Resource Allocation via Predicted Service Chaining

**Concept:** Leverage predicted usage curves (as generated by the core patent) not just for *scaling* individual services, but for proactively establishing and adjusting *service chains* based on anticipated user needs. This moves beyond simple resource allocation to intelligent orchestration.

**Specification:**

**1. Service Chain Definition & Templates:**

*   A repository of pre-defined service chains will be maintained. Examples: "High-Throughput Data Processing," "Real-Time Analytics," "Secure Data Transfer."
*   Each chain defines the sequence of network services required, their dependencies, and initial resource allocations.
*   Chains are parameterized – allowing for scaling of individual service instances within the chain.
*   Chains are versioned - ensuring reproducibility and rollback capability.
*   Chain definitions are stored as YAML or JSON files for easy management and programmatic access.

**2. Usage Prediction Integration:**

*   The system will ingest predicted usage curves *for each service* within a potential chain, as generated by the original patent.
*   A “Chain Demand Forecaster” module will analyze these curves to predict *overall* chain demand.  This is not a simple summation, but considers inter-service dependencies and potential bottlenecks.
*   The Forecaster will output a predicted resource profile for the entire chain – including CPU, memory, network bandwidth, storage, and potentially specialized hardware.

**3. Proactive Chain Provisioning & Adjustment:**

*   A “Chain Orchestrator” module will utilize the predicted resource profile to proactively provision service chains *before* demand peaks.
*   Provisioning will be handled via Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools (Terraform, Ansible, etc.) for automation and reproducibility.
*   The Orchestrator will dynamically adjust chain scale based on real-time usage data *and* ongoing predicted curves.  Scale-out and scale-in operations will be automated.
*   A “Resource Arbitrator” will manage resource contention between chains, prioritizing based on pre-defined service level agreements (SLAs) or dynamic business rules.
*   Chain adjustments will not be disruptive.  Rollout of new chain versions will use blue/green deployments or canary releases.

**4. Pseudocode - Chain Orchestrator Core Loop**

```
while (true) {
    // 1. Fetch Predicted Usage Curves for all potential service chains
    curves = UsagePredictionService.GetCurves();

    // 2. Forecast demand for each chain
    predictedProfiles = ChainDemandForecaster.Forecast(curves);

    // 3. Compare predicted profiles with current provisioned resources
    resourceGaps = ResourceAllocator.CalculateGaps(predictedProfiles, currentResources);

    // 4. Provision/De-provision resources to address gaps
    if (resourceGaps != null) {
        IaCProvisioner.Provision(resourceGaps);
    }

    // 5. Monitor Real-time Usage & Recalculate (Loop back to Step 1 with reduced interval)
    MonitorService.Monitor(currentResources);

    sleep(60); // Check every minute
}
```

**5.  Data Model:**

*   **Service:**  Name, Description, Resource Requirements (CPU, Memory, Network, Storage), Scaling Parameters
*   **Chain:** Name, Description, List of Services (ordered),  Dependencies, Initial Resource Allocation
*   **Prediction:** Timestamp, Service Name, Predicted Usage Curve (array of values)
*   **Allocation:** Chain Name, Service Name, Allocated Resources (CPU, Memory, Network, Storage)

**Innovation Focus:** Shifting from reactive scaling of individual services to proactive orchestration of *complete service chains* based on predicted demand.  This enables a more holistic and efficient allocation of resources, improving performance and reducing costs.  This goes beyond the original patent by introducing the concept of chained services and intelligent orchestration, offering a more robust and scalable solution.
