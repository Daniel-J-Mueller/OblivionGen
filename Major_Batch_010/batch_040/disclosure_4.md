**Dynamic Emotional Resonance Highlighting**

**Concept:** Extend the existing highlight generation to incorporate real-time emotional analysis of both the media content *and* the user viewing it, tailoring the highlights not just to “engagement” but to *emotional impact* and shared emotional experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Live Media Stream (video, audio)
    *   User Device Sensor Data: Webcam (facial expression analysis), Microphone (voice tone/volume analysis), Heart Rate Monitor (if available via wearable integration), Keyboard/Controller input (rapid/erratic input as proxy for excitement/frustration)
    *   Social Media Data (as in the base patent)
*   **Emotional Analysis Modules:**
    *   *Content Analysis:* AI model trained to identify emotional cues in video (facial expressions, body language) and audio (tone, music). Output: Emotional "score" per time segment (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, suspense).  Model leverages pre-trained models fine-tuned on event-specific datasets.
    *   *User Analysis:* AI model processes user sensor data to infer emotional state. Webcam -> Facial Expression Recognition (FER); Microphone -> Speech Emotion Recognition (SER); Heart Rate -> Arousal Level. Output: User Emotional Score per time segment.  Multi-modal fusion for increased accuracy.
*   **Resonance Calculation:**
    *   For each time segment, calculate a “Resonance Score” =  (Content Emotional Score * User Emotional Score).  This measures the alignment between the emotional impact of the content and the user’s emotional response.  Normalization to avoid dominance by one factor.
    *   Time-series analysis to identify peaks and troughs in Resonance Score, highlighting moments of highest emotional connection.
*   **Highlight Generation:**
    *   Instead of simply maximizing "engagement" (as per the base patent), prioritize segments with the highest Resonance Scores.
    *   Dynamic clip length adjustment based on Resonance Score – higher scores justify longer clips to fully capture the emotional moment.
    *   Optional:  Emotional “tagging” of clips – e.g., “Joyful Moment,” “Suspenseful Build-up,” “Heartbreaking Scene.”
*   **User Customization:**
    *   Users can specify preferred emotional “profiles” – e.g., “Show me the most heartwarming moments,” “Focus on the action and suspense,” “Avoid sad content.”
    *   Privacy controls for sensor data – users can opt-out of sharing sensor data for personalized highlighting.
*   **System Architecture:**
    1.  Ingest live media stream and user sensor data.
    2.  Run content and user analysis modules in parallel.
    3.  Calculate Resonance Scores for each time segment.
    4.  Identify peak Resonance moments.
    5.  Generate clips based on peak moments and dynamic clip length adjustment.
    6.  Apply emotional tags.
    7.  Deliver highlights to the user.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateEmotionalHighlights(mediaStream, userSensorData, userPreferences) {
  contentEmotionalScores = analyzeContentEmotion(mediaStream);
  userEmotionalScores = analyzeUserEmotion(userSensorData, userPreferences);

  resonanceScores = [];
  for (i = 0; i < contentEmotionalScores.length; i++) {
    resonanceScore = contentEmotionalScores[i] * userEmotionalScores[i];
    resonanceScores.push(resonanceScore);
  }

  peakMoments = findPeaks(resonanceScores, sensitivity); //Sensitivity parameter controls peak detection

  highlightClips = [];
  for (j = 0; j < peakMoments.length; j++) {
    startTime = peakMoments[j] - clipHalfLength;
    endTime = peakMoments[j] + clipHalfLength;
    clip = generateClip(mediaStream, startTime, endTime);
    clip.tags = getEmotionalTags(clip, emotionalTagThreshold);
    highlightClips.push(clip);
  }

  return highlightClips;
}
