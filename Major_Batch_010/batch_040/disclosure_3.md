## Dynamic Search Facet Generation via Predictive User Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the persistent search functionality by dynamically generating search facets *predictively* based on a user's browsing history and inferred intent, even *before* a second search criteria is entered. This moves beyond simply combining results – it proactively refines the search space.

**Specs:**

**1. User Profile Construction:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Browser History (with user consent).
    *   Prior Search Queries (within the system).
    *   Clicked/Viewed Items from Search Results.
    *   Time spent viewing specific item details.
    *   Implicit feedback (e.g., scrolling behavior on result pages).
*   **Modeling:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, an LSTM or GRU – to model the user's sequential behavior. The input will be a time series of actions (searches, clicks, views). The output will be a vector representing the user's current intent/interest.
*   **Intent Vector:** This vector will encode the user’s preferences, potentially categorizing them into dimensions (e.g., price range, brand preference, feature importance).

**2. Predictive Facet Generation:**

*   **Facet Database:** Maintain a comprehensive database of potential search facets (categories, attributes, price ranges, brands, etc.).
*   **Relevance Scoring:**  For each potential facet, calculate a relevance score based on the user's intent vector. This could be a dot product between the facet's vector representation (obtained through embedding techniques) and the user's intent vector.
*   **Dynamic Facet List:**  Generate a ranked list of the most relevant facets.  This list will be displayed to the user *before* they enter a second search criteria.  The number of displayed facets will be configurable.

**3. Integration with Persistent Search:**

*   When a user selects a first search result and initiates a persistent search, the system *immediately* displays the dynamically generated facet list.
*   The user can then select one or more facets to refine the search.  This acts as the "second search criteria".
*   The system combines the original search result with the results matching the selected facets (as in the provided patent), but crucially, the user is guided towards relevant refinements *proactively*.

**4. Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// User Profile Construction
function build_user_profile(user_id):
    history = get_browser_history(user_id) + get_search_history(user_id) + get_clickstream_data(user_id)
    user_vector = RNN(history) // Output is user's intent vector
    return user_vector

// Predictive Facet Generation
function generate_facets(user_vector):
    facet_database = get_all_facets()
    for facet in facet_database:
        facet_vector = get_facet_embedding(facet) // Vector representation of the facet
        relevance_score = dot_product(user_vector, facet_vector)
        facet.relevance = relevance_score
    ranked_facets = sort_facets_by_relevance(facet_database)
    return ranked_facets[:10] // Return top 10 facets

// Persistent Search Integration
function persistent_search(user_id, first_search_result, first_search_criteria):
    user_vector = build_user_profile(user_id)
    ranked_facets = generate_facets(user_vector)
    display_facets(ranked_facets) // Show the user the facets
    selected_facets = user_selection() // Get the user's selections
    second_search_criteria = selected_facets // Use the selections as the second criteria
    combined_results = combine_results(first_search_result, second_search_criteria)
    return combined_results
```

**5. Potential Extensions:**

*   **A/B Testing:**  Experiment with different RNN architectures and training data to optimize facet prediction accuracy.
*   **Personalized Facet Ordering:**  Dynamically reorder facets based on the user’s past interactions.
*   **Visual Facet Representation:**  Utilize icons or images to make facets more visually appealing and easier to understand.
*   **Real-time Updates:**  Update the facet list in real-time as the user interacts with the search results.
