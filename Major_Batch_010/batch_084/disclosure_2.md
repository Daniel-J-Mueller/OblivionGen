## Dynamic Workload Mirroring with Predictive Bandwidth Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the shared processing model by proactively mirroring entire workloads (or critical segments) across private and public service networks *before* resource constraints are detected. This creates a "hot spare" system, drastically reducing latency and ensuring resilience.  The system will predict bandwidth needs and pre-allocate resources, minimizing transfer times during failover or peak load.

**Specifications:**

**1.  Workload Profiler & Segmenter:**

*   **Function:** Analyzes incoming workloads, identifying critical segments (e.g., database queries, core processing loops).  Assigns a "Criticality Score" (1-10) based on processing time, data dependencies, and user priority.
*   **Input:** Workload data stream, user priority settings.
*   **Output:**  Segmented workload representation with Criticality Scores.
*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```
    function profileWorkload(workloadData, userPriority):
        segments = divideWorkloadIntoSegments(workloadData)
        for segment in segments:
            processingTime = estimateProcessingTime(segment)
            dataDependencies = analyzeDataDependencies(segment)
            criticalityScore = calculateCriticalityScore(processingTime, dataDependencies, userPriority)
            segment.criticalityScore = criticalityScore
        return segments
    ```

**2. Predictive Bandwidth Allocator:**

*   **Function:**  Monitors network conditions (latency, throughput, jitter) between private and public networks.  Predicts bandwidth requirements for workload segments based on their size, criticality, and historical data.  Pre-allocates bandwidth on both networks.
*   **Input:** Network monitoring data, workload segment data, historical bandwidth usage.
*   **Output:** Bandwidth allocation schedule.
*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```
    function allocateBandwidth(workloadSegments, networkData, historicalData):
        for segment in workloadSegments:
            predictedBandwidth = predictBandwidth(segment, historicalData)
            allocateBandwidthOnPrivateNetwork(segment, predictedBandwidth)
            allocateBandwidthOnPublicNetwork(segment, predictedBandwidth)
        return bandwidthAllocationSchedule
    ```

**3.  Dynamic Mirroring Engine:**

*   **Function:**  Replicates workload segments to both private and public networks based on Criticality Scores and available bandwidth.  Prioritizes mirroring of high-criticality segments.
*   **Input:** Workload segments, bandwidth allocation schedule.
*   **Output:** Mirrored workload data on both networks.
*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```
    function mirrorWorkload(workloadSegments, bandwidthAllocationSchedule):
        sortedSegments = sortSegmentsByCriticality(workloadSegments)
        for segment in sortedSegments:
            if isBandwidthAvailable(segment, bandwidthAllocationSchedule):
                copySegmentToPrivateNetwork(segment)
                copySegmentToPublicNetwork(segment)
```

**4.  Intelligent Failover & Load Balancing:**

*   **Function:** Monitors resource availability on both networks.  Seamlessly redirects processing to the network with available capacity.  Distributes load across both networks during normal operation.
*   **Input:** Network resource status, workload segment status.
*   **Output:** Processing redirection commands.
*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```
    function manageProcessing(workloadSegments):
        for segment in workloadSegments:
            if isPrivateNetworkOverloaded():
                redirectSegmentToPublicNetwork(segment)
            elif isPublicNetworkOverloaded():
                redirectSegmentToPrivateNetwork(segment)
            else:
                distributeLoadBetweenNetworks(segment)
```

**5. Data Synchronization Protocol:**

*   **Function:** Ensures data consistency between mirrored segments on both networks. Uses a differential synchronization algorithm to minimize data transfer.
*   **Input:** Mirrored segment data.
*   **Output:** Synchronized segment data.
*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```
    function synchronizeData(segmentPrivate, segmentPublic):
        diff = calculateDataDifference(segmentPrivate, segmentPublic)
        transferDiffToPublicNetwork(diff)
        transferDiffToPrivateNetwork(diff)
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-bandwidth network interfaces on all systems.
*   Fast storage (SSD or NVMe) for data mirroring.
*   Dedicated processing cores for data synchronization and monitoring.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Real-time operating system for low-latency processing.
*   Advanced network monitoring and analysis tools.
*   Secure communication protocols for data transfer.
