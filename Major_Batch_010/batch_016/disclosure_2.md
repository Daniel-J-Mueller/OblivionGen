**Conveyor Acoustic Resonance Mapping (CARM) System**

**Concept:** Utilize a network of micro-speakers and microphones positioned *above* and *along the sides* of the conveyor belt to create a dynamic acoustic profile of packages in motion. This system goes beyond simple obstruction detection to identify package characteristics – size, shape, weight distribution, and even potential damage – *before* they cause jams or fall-offs.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Micro-Speaker Array:** High-frequency (20kHz-40kHz) micro-speakers spaced every 15cm along the length of the conveyor, and in a staggered configuration across its width. Speakers will emit short bursts of inaudible (to humans) ultrasonic frequencies.
*   **Microphone Array:** Highly sensitive MEMS microphones, matching the speaker layout. These microphones will capture the reflected ultrasonic waves.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated FPGA or high-performance embedded processor to handle real-time signal processing.
*   **Sensor Fusion Module:** Combines acoustic data with existing sensor inputs (optical sensors, weight sensors) for improved accuracy and reliability.
*   **Power Supply:** Standard 24V DC power supply.

**Software/Algorithm Specifications:**

1.  **Baseline Calibration:** Initial system calibration to create an acoustic "fingerprint" of an empty conveyor.
2.  **Signal Emission & Capture:** Speakers emit short ultrasonic bursts. Microphones capture the reflected signals.
3.  **Acoustic Mapping:** Utilize Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and beamforming techniques to create a 3D acoustic map of the packages on the conveyor.  This map will show the location, size, and shape of each package.
4.  **Anomaly Detection:**  Compare the current acoustic map to a learned "normal" profile. Any significant deviation indicates a potential problem (e.g., improperly positioned package, shifted load, damaged package).
5.  **Predictive Jamming Analysis:**  Algorithm to predict potential jamming points based on package size, shape, and relative positions.
6.  **Dynamic Conveyor Control:**  Based on the analysis, adjust conveyor speed or activate robotic arms to reposition packages *before* they cause problems.
7.  **Data Logging & Reporting:**  Store acoustic data for analysis and reporting.  Identify recurring problems and optimize conveyor layout.
