## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Personalized Audio Projection

**Concept:** Expand noise compensation beyond simple frequency alteration to full acoustic scene reconstruction and personalized audio projection, creating a localized “bubble” of enhanced audio for the user.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array (First Device):** Minimum 8 microphones, spatially distributed for accurate sound source localization and beamforming. High SNR, wide frequency response.
*   **Spatial Audio Renderer (First Device - Processing Device):** Dedicated DSP or FPGA for real-time acoustic scene analysis, reconstruction, and rendering.
*   **Bone Conduction Transducers (First Device - Speaker):**  Utilize bone conduction to deliver processed audio directly to the user’s inner ear, bypassing ambient noise and maintaining situational awareness. This will be the primary output, supplemented by miniature directional speakers.
*   **Miniature Directional Speakers (First Device - Speaker):** Array of small, high-frequency speakers capable of narrow beamforming, used to augment the bone conduction experience and create a more immersive soundscape.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):**  Embedded IMU to track head position and orientation for accurate spatial audio rendering.
*   **Second Device:** Any device capable of capturing ambient audio (smartphone, dedicated microphone).
*   **Third Device:** An optional intermediary device (e.g., a smart speaker) for extended range or improved processing.

**2. Software/Algorithm Components:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Analysis:** Algorithm to analyze ambient audio captured by the microphone array to identify sound sources (speech, music, traffic, etc.) and estimate their position, distance, and characteristics (e.g., reverberation, noise levels).  Employ a combination of traditional signal processing techniques (beamforming, source localization) and machine learning models (deep neural networks) trained on large datasets of acoustic scenes.
*   **Noise Compensation & Source Separation:** Advanced noise cancellation algorithms specifically designed to remove unwanted noise from identified sound sources.  Utilize source separation techniques to isolate individual sound sources and enhance their clarity.
*   **Personalized Audio Profiles:**  Algorithm to create personalized audio profiles based on the user’s hearing characteristics (audiogram), preferences (EQ settings, sound signatures), and listening environment (home, office, outdoors).
*   **Spatial Audio Rendering Engine:**  Algorithm to render the processed audio in 3D space, creating a realistic and immersive soundscape.  Utilize head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) personalized to the user’s anatomy to accurately simulate the direction and distance of sound sources.
*   **Dynamic Acoustic Bubble Control:** Algorithm to create and control a dynamic “acoustic bubble” around the user, selectively amplifying desired sound sources and suppressing unwanted noise. The bubble’s size and shape should adapt to the user’s movements and the surrounding environment.
*   **Inter-Device Communication Protocol:** Secure and reliable communication protocol for transmitting audio data and control signals between the first, second, and third devices.  Support for multiple communication channels (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, UWB).

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Ambient Audio Capture:** The first device captures ambient audio using the microphone array. The second device (optional) provides additional audio input from a wider area.
2.  **Acoustic Scene Analysis:** The acoustic scene analysis algorithm processes the captured audio to identify sound sources, estimate their position, and characterize their noise levels.
3.  **Noise Compensation & Source Separation:** The noise compensation algorithm removes unwanted noise from the identified sound sources, and the source separation algorithm isolates individual sounds.
4.  **Personalized Audio Processing:** The personalized audio processing algorithm adjusts the audio characteristics based on the user's profile and preferences.
5.  **Spatial Audio Rendering:** The spatial audio rendering engine creates a 3D soundscape, accurately positioning the processed audio in space.
6.  **Acoustic Bubble Creation:** The dynamic acoustic bubble control algorithm creates a localized "bubble" of enhanced audio around the user, selectively amplifying desired sounds and suppressing noise.
7.  **Audio Output:** The processed audio is output to the user via the bone conduction transducers and miniature directional speakers.
8.  **Real-time Adaptation:** The system continuously monitors the acoustic environment and adapts the audio processing and bubble control in real-time to maintain optimal audio quality and immersion.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Acoustic Bubble Control):**

```
function updateBubble(audioData, headPosition, environmentMap):
    desiredSources = identifyDesiredSources(audioData)
    noiseSources = identifyNoiseSources(audioData)

    bubbleRadius = calculateBubbleRadius(headPosition, environmentMap)
    bubbleShape = defineBubbleShape(desiredSources, noiseSources)

    for each source in desiredSources:
        amplify(source, bubbleShape)

    for each source in noiseSources:
        attenuate(source, bubbleShape)

    renderAudio(processedAudio, headPosition)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced communication in noisy environments
*   Immersive virtual and augmented reality experiences
*   Personalized audio for music and entertainment
*   Assistive listening devices for the hearing impaired
*   Privacy-focused communication (localized audio transmission)
