## Spatial Audio Beaconing for Dynamic Conference Localization

**Concept:** Extend the locale-based aggregation concept by leveraging spatial audio beaconing to *automatically* and *dynamically* identify and group participants sharing a physical space, even without pre-configuration or network awareness. This moves beyond simple locale detection and enables truly fluid, room-based conference groupings.

**Specs:**

**I. Beacon Generation & Emission (Client-Side):**

*   **Audio Signature Generation:** Each client device periodically (e.g., every 500ms) generates a unique, low-frequency (20-80Hz) ultrasonic audio "beacon". This beacon is *inaudible* to humans but detectable by nearby devices. The signature isn’t a static frequency; it utilizes a pseudo-random sequence generated from device-specific seed data (MAC address, hardware ID) and a time component. This minimizes false positives from identical beacons.
*   **Directional Emission (Optional):** Devices with multiple microphones/speakers could utilize beamforming to focus the beacon transmission in a wide, but defined, arc.  This enhances localization accuracy.
*   **Beacon Payload:** The payload includes:
    *   Device ID
    *   Conference ID
    *   Timestamp
    *   Signal Strength (estimated distance)
    *   Optional: Room ID (if pre-configured, provides a starting point)

**II. Beacon Reception & Localization (Server-Side & Client-Side):**

*   **Continuous Listening:** Each client device *continuously* listens for beacons from other devices.
*   **Triangulation/Multilateration:** The server (or a designated client) calculates the approximate location of each beacon source using Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) or Angle of Arrival (AOA) techniques based on received signal strength and/or microphone array data. Multiple devices acting as receivers improve accuracy.
*   **Clustering Algorithm:** A clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, k-means) groups devices based on their proximity. This dynamically identifies “rooms” or shared spaces. The algorithm is tuned to account for typical room sizes and ambient noise levels.
*   **Room Assignment:**  Once a room is identified, all devices within that cluster are automatically assigned to the same “audio space”.

**III. Audio Aggregation & Mixing:**

*   **Localized Audio Streams:**  Within each identified room, a client aggregation node (selected as in the original patent) mixes audio streams from all participants in that room into a single aggregated stream.
*   **Spatial Audio Processing (Optional):** Apply spatial audio processing techniques (e.g., HRTF filtering) to simulate the directionality of sound sources within the room. This enhances the immersive experience.
*   **Conference Mixing:** The server mixes the aggregated audio streams from each identified room with streams from remote participants.

**IV. Pseudocode (Server-Side - Beacon Processing):**

```
function processBeacon(beaconData) {
  device_id = beaconData.device_id
  timestamp = beaconData.timestamp
  signal_strength = beaconData.signal_strength
  
  // Update device location based on signal strength and timestamp
  location = calculateLocation(device_id, signal_strength, timestamp)

  // Add device to location cluster
  cluster = findNearestCluster(location)
  if (cluster == null) {
    cluster = createNewCluster(location)
  }
  addDeviceToCluster(device_id, cluster)

  // If cluster size exceeds threshold, designate aggregation node
  if (cluster.size() > min_room_size) {
    aggregation_node = selectAggregationNode(cluster)
    assignAggregationNode(aggregation_node, cluster)
  }
}

function calculateLocation(device_id, signal_strength, timestamp){
  //Implementation of triangulation or multilateration based on signal strength.
  //returns 2D or 3D coordinate.
}
```

**V. Considerations:**

*   **Noise Cancellation:** Robust noise cancellation algorithms are crucial to filter out ambient noise and prevent false beacon detections.
*   **Security:** Beacon data should be encrypted to prevent eavesdropping and spoofing.
*   **Scalability:** The system must be scalable to handle a large number of devices and conference calls.
*   **Power Consumption:** Minimize power consumption on client devices by optimizing beacon transmission and reception intervals.
