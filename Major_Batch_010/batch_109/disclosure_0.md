## Adaptive Snapshot Granularity & Predictive Provisioning

**Concept:** Extending snapshot functionality to dynamically adjust granularity *during* snapshot creation, coupled with predictive provisioning based on historical usage patterns captured *within* the snapshot itself. This isn’t just about *what* is saved, but *how much* and *anticipating* what will be needed upon restoration.

**Specifications:**

**1. Granularity Profiles:**

*   Define configurable granularity profiles (e.g., “Minimal”, “Standard”, “Detailed”, “Raw”). Each profile dictates the level of detail captured for different resource types.
*   “Minimal” – Captures only metadata (configuration, dependencies) – fast snapshot, minimal storage.
*   “Standard” – Captures configuration, core application data, and recent logs.
*   “Detailed” – Captures configuration, application data, logs, and performance metrics.
*   “Raw” – Captures a block-level image of all data – slowest snapshot, maximum storage, highest fidelity.
*   Implement a profile editor allowing administrators to customize these profiles. Resource types (databases, VMs, network devices) are selectable, alongside granularity levels for each.

**2. Dynamic Granularity Adjustment:**

*   During snapshot creation, monitor resource I/O and CPU usage in real-time.
*   Implement adaptive algorithms. If a resource exhibits high activity, *automatically* increase its granularity level (within profile limits). If a resource is idle, decrease granularity.
*   Store granularity adjustment history *within* the snapshot metadata. This enables precise restoration and optimization.
*   Algorithm pseudocode:

    ```
    For each resource in snapshot:
        resource_io = getCurrentIO(resource)
        resource_cpu = getCurrentCPU(resource)
        base_granularity = getBaseGranularity(resource, profile)
        adjusted_granularity = base_granularity
        If resource_io > high_threshold:
            adjusted_granularity = increaseGranularity(adjusted_granularity)
        Else If resource_io < low_threshold:
            adjusted_granularity = decreaseGranularity(adjusted_granularity)
        logGranularityAdjustment(resource, adjusted_granularity)
    ```

**3. Usage Pattern Capture & Prediction:**

*   Within the snapshot, capture historical usage metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network traffic) for each resource over a defined period.
*   Implement machine learning algorithms (time series analysis, regression) to predict future resource needs based on captured usage patterns.
*   Store prediction models *within* the snapshot metadata.

**4. Predictive Provisioning:**

*   During restoration, utilize stored prediction models to dynamically provision resources.
*   Allocate resources based on predicted demand, rather than static configuration.
*   Implement auto-scaling capabilities to adjust resource allocation in real-time.

**5. Restoration Process:**

*   During restoration, the system analyzes the snapshot metadata to determine appropriate resource allocation.
*   Based on captured usage patterns and prediction models, resources are dynamically provisioned.
*   The system automatically configures resources based on snapshot data.
*   Algorithm Pseudocode:

    ```
    For each resource in snapshot:
        predicted_cpu = getPredictedCPU(resource, prediction_model)
        predicted_memory = getPredictedMemory(resource, prediction_model)
        provisionResource(resource, predicted_cpu, predicted_memory)
        configureResource(resource, snapshot_data)
    ```

**6. System Components:**

*   **Snapshot Agent:** Runs on each node, captures data, monitors resource usage.
*   **Snapshot Coordinator:** Orchestrates snapshot creation and restoration.
*   **Metadata Store:** Stores snapshot data, configuration, usage patterns, prediction models.
*   **Provisioning Engine:** Dynamically allocates and configures resources.
*   **Machine Learning Module:** Implements prediction algorithms.
