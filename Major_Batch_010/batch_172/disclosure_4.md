## Adaptive Component Sandboxing & Resource Negotiation

**Concept:** Extend the existing system to dynamically create and manage isolated 'sandboxes' for software components *before* resource allocation, employing a negotiation protocol based on predicted resource usage and component criticality. This moves beyond simply selecting nodes that *have* resources to actively shaping the execution environment to optimize for component-level constraints and dependencies.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sandbox Definition Module:**

*   **Input:** Component metadata (usage model, dependencies, predicted resource footprint - CPU, memory, network I/O, storage), Component criticality score (user-defined or system-calculated), Security profile (required permissions, access control lists), geographic constraints.
*   **Process:** Generates a sandbox definition containing:
    *   Resource limits (hard and soft caps).
    *   Network isolation rules (allowed connections, firewall settings).
    *   File system access control (read/write permissions, mounted volumes).
    *   Process isolation parameters (user/group ID, cgroups/namespaces).
    *   Geographic constraints - defining allowed regions for component execution.
*   **Output:** Sandbox Definition (JSON/YAML format).

**2. Resource Negotiation Agent (RNA):**

*   **Function:** Operates on each computing node. Negotiates resource allocation requests from the Application Deployment System.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Receives Resource Allocation Request + Sandbox Definition.
    2.  Evaluates request against available resources and node policies.
    3.  If resources are insufficient, initiates a 'bid' process with other RNA agents on other nodes (using a distributed consensus algorithm - Raft or Paxos). Bids include resource offers and associated costs (e.g., monetary cost, performance impact).
    4.  Selects the optimal resource allocation plan based on cost and performance.
    5.  Returns a confirmation or rejection to the Application Deployment System.

**3. Dynamic Sandbox Creation Service:**

*   **Input:** Resource Allocation Confirmation, Sandbox Definition.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Creates a lightweight container or virtual machine (based on the selected technology - Docker, Kata Containers, Firecracker) with the specified Sandbox Definition.
    2.  Registers the created sandbox with the Application Deployment System.

**4. Component Execution & Monitoring:**

*   The Application Deployment System deploys the software component into the registered sandbox.
*   A monitoring agent within the sandbox tracks resource usage, security events, and performance metrics.
*   If the component exceeds resource limits or violates security policies, the sandbox automatically terminates the component and reports the incident.

**Pseudocode (RNA Agent):**

```
function receive_request(request, sandbox_definition):
  available_resources = get_available_resources()
  required_resources = sandbox_definition.resource_requirements

  if available_resources >= required_resources:
    allocate_resources(required_resources)
    return "accepted"

  else:
    bid_request = create_bid_request(sandbox_definition)
    responses = send_bid_request(bid_request)

    best_response = select_best_response(responses)

    if best_response != null:
      allocate_resources(best_response.resource_offer)
      return "accepted"
    else:
      return "rejected"
```

**Novelty:**

This moves beyond simply *finding* resources to actively *shaping* the execution environment through dynamic sandboxing and negotiation. This allows for fine-grained control over component behavior, improved security, and optimized resource utilization. The geographic constraints add another layer of control, allowing for data sovereignty and compliance with regional regulations.
