## Temporal Data Reconstruction via Probabilistic Shadowing

**Specification:** A system to reconstruct historical states of data objects, beyond simple versioning, by probabilistically inferring “shadow” states based on observed changes and associated metadata.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of solely storing discrete versions, the system models the evolution of an object’s data as a continuous process.  Each modification isn’t just a snapshot, but a data point contributing to a probabilistic model of how the object *would* have existed at any point in time.

**Components:**

*   **Change Vectorizer:** Analyzes each modification (diff) to an object and converts it into a feature vector. This vector captures the *type* of change (addition, deletion, modification), the *scope* (which data fields were affected), and the *magnitude* (how much the data changed).
*   **Temporal Model:**  A probabilistic model (e.g., a Gaussian Process, a Recurrent Neural Network with a temporal component) that learns the relationship between change vectors and time.  This model is trained on the history of modifications for each object.
*   **Shadow Generator:**  Given a target time, the Shadow Generator uses the Temporal Model to *predict* the most probable state of the object at that time. This prediction isn’t necessarily an exact version, but a reconstructed “shadow” state.
*   **Metadata Augmentation:**  Each modification is tagged with rich metadata: timestamp, user ID, application context, and, crucially, a confidence score (assigned by the Change Vectorizer) representing the reliability of the change. The Temporal Model incorporates this metadata when learning.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** The system identifies and resolves conflicting modifications. A modification is not directly applied to the object, instead it is stored and added to the ongoing temporal model as a potential update. Conflict is resolved based on metadata, confidence scores and timestamp.
*   **Data Lake Integration:** An integrated data lake is utilized to store historical changes, metadata, and generated shadow states. This enables advanced analytics and auditing.

**Pseudocode (Shadow Generation):**

```
function generateShadowState(objectKey, targetTime):
  // 1. Retrieve historical changes from the Data Lake for objectKey
  changes = DataLake.getChanges(objectKey)

  // 2. Filter changes to those relevant to the targetTime
  relevantChanges = filterChangesByTime(changes, targetTime)

  // 3. Apply Temporal Model to predict the object state at targetTime
  predictedState = TemporalModel.predictState(relevantChanges, targetTime)

  // 4. Return the predicted state
  return predictedState
```

**Novelty & Potential:**

*   **Beyond Snapshots:** This allows reconstruction of object states *between* discrete versions, enabling fine-grained historical analysis.
*   **Forensic Analysis:** Supports advanced forensic analysis by reconstructing the state of data at specific moments, identifying the origin and evolution of changes.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  The Temporal Model can identify anomalous changes that deviate from the learned evolution pattern.
*   **Data Repair:** Reconstructs previous data states as part of recovery.
*   **Improved Auditing:** Allows auditing of specific states with granularity beyond standard version control.

**Implementation Considerations:**

*   Scalability of the Temporal Model.
*   Efficient storage and retrieval of historical changes.
*   Balancing accuracy and performance of the Shadow Generator.
*   Managing the complexity of the metadata augmentation process.
