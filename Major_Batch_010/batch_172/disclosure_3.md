## Dynamic Packet Steering Based on Predicted Congestion

**Concept:** Extend the existing forwarding table update mechanism to proactively steer packets *before* congestion occurs, leveraging machine learning to predict network bottlenecks. Rather than reacting to congestion (e.g., through Explicit Congestion Notification), this system anticipates it.

**Specifications:**

**1. Congestion Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time network telemetry (packet loss, latency, bandwidth utilization) from multiple network vantage points (routers, switches, end-hosts). Historical network traffic patterns.
*   **Processing:** Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on historical and real-time data to predict potential congestion points in the network. Output is a “Congestion Heatmap” – a time-series prediction of congestion probabilities for various network links/paths.
*   **Output:** Congestion Heatmap (time-to-congestion, probability of congestion for each link/path).

**2. Dynamic Steering Table (DST):**

*   A parallel forwarding table alongside the existing one. The DST stores alternative paths for packets based on the Congestion Heatmap.
*   DST Entries:  `(Destination IP, Alternative Path, Congestion Threshold, Activation Time)`.
    *   `Destination IP`:  The destination IP address.
    *   `Alternative Path`:  A pre-calculated alternate path to the destination.
    *   `Congestion Threshold`:  The predicted congestion level that triggers steering to the alternative path.
    *   `Activation Time`:  The time at which the alternate path becomes active.

**3. Update Mechanism Integration:**

*   The existing forwarding table update mechanism (from the provided patent) will be extended to also update the DST.
*   When the controller detects a potential congestion event (predicted by the Congestion Prediction Module), it will:
    1.  Query the Congestion Prediction Module for alternative paths.
    2.  Allocate reserved entries in the DST.
    3.  Populate the reserved entries with the alternative path information.
    4.  Modify a steering pointer to activate the alternate path *before* congestion actually occurs.
    5.  Monitor congestion levels on both the original and alternate paths.
    6.  Dynamically adjust steering based on real-time conditions.

**4. Hardware/Software Interaction**

*   **Dedicated Circuitry:** Implement a dedicated hardware module to handle the steering pointer modification and path selection. This will minimize latency and ensure real-time performance.
*   **Microcode:** The dedicated circuitry will execute microcode provided by the controller to perform the following:
    *   Fetch the steering pointer.
    *   Compare the current path to the pre-calculated alternate paths stored in the DST.
    *   Modify the steering pointer to select the alternate path if the predicted congestion level exceeds the defined threshold.
*   **Controller Software:**  The controller will run a daemon process that continuously monitors network telemetry and updates the DST.

**Pseudocode (Controller):**

```
function update_steering_table(network_telemetry):
    congestion_heatmap = predict_congestion(network_telemetry)

    for destination_ip in known_destinations:
        alternative_path, congestion_threshold = find_best_alternative_path(destination_ip, congestion_heatmap)
        if congestion_threshold is not null:
            allocate_reserved_entries_for(destination_ip)
            store_alternative_path_in_reserved_entries(destination_ip, alternative_path)
            modify_steering_pointer(destination_ip, reserved_entries_address)
            activate_at_time(activation_time)
```

**Novelty:** This system is proactive rather than reactive. Existing systems respond to congestion *after* it occurs. This system anticipates congestion and steers traffic *before* it impacts performance. The combination of ML-based prediction, dynamic steering tables, and dedicated hardware acceleration will result in a significant improvement in network performance and resilience. The time-based activation is also a unique feature.
