## Dynamic Window Composition with Predictive Occlusion

**Concept:** Extend the seamless windowing concept by not only matching window positions and sizes but *predictively* composing windows on the host *before* streaming, utilizing client-side input data. This aims to reduce latency and bandwidth by pre-rendering a more accurate composite image.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition (Client-Side):**

*   **Input Stream:** Capture client-side input events (mouse movements, clicks, keyboard presses) *before* they are fully processed by the client application. This is a low-latency stream of *intent*, not action.
*   **Window State:** Continuously transmit the current state of all client windows (size, position, z-order, content - partially rendered if available).
*   **Prediction Confidence:**  Assess the 'confidence' in prediction – how certain are we about the next client action based on input stream history. This will be a value between 0 and 1.

**2. Host-Side Composition Engine:**

*   **Mirrored Window System:** Host maintains a “shadow” desktop mirroring the client’s window arrangement.  These are virtual windows – not actually displayed on the host’s screen.
*   **Predictive Rendering:**
    *   Receive the client’s input stream and window state.
    *   Using a lightweight prediction model (e.g., a simple state machine or a short-term recurrent neural network), *predict* the likely next window actions (e.g., window drag, resize, minimize).
    *   Render the mirrored window arrangement on the host *as if* those predicted actions had already occurred.  This is a ‘what-if’ rendering.
*   **Differential Encoding:**  Instead of streaming the entire host frame buffer, encode *only* the differences between the currently displayed frame and the predictively rendered frame. This minimizes bandwidth.
*   **Confidence-Based Fallback:**
    *   If prediction confidence is high (>0.8), stream only the differential encoding.
    *   If confidence is low (<0.5), revert to streaming the entire host frame buffer.
    *   If confidence is medium (0.5-0.8), stream both the differential encoding *and* a lower-resolution version of the full frame as a fallback.

**3. Streaming Protocol:**

*   **Adaptive Bitrate:**  Dynamically adjust the bitrate based on network conditions and prediction confidence.
*   **Prioritization:** Prioritize streaming data for windows that are actively being interacted with.
*   **Compression:** Utilize a highly efficient video codec optimized for screen sharing.

**Pseudocode (Host-Side):**

```
Loop:
  Receive Client Input Stream & Window State
  Predict Next Window Actions (using Prediction Model)
  Create Shadow Window Arrangement on Host (based on prediction)
  Render Shadow Arrangement
  Calculate Differential (between current frame & predicted frame)

  If Prediction Confidence > 0.8:
    Encode & Stream Differential
  Else If Prediction Confidence < 0.5:
    Encode & Stream Full Frame
  Else:
    Encode & Stream Differential AND Lower-Resolution Full Frame

```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Dedicated GPU on the host for fast rendering of the shadow window arrangement.
*   Low-latency network connection between client and host.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency due to pre-rendering.
*   Lower bandwidth consumption.
*   Improved user experience, especially for interactive applications.
