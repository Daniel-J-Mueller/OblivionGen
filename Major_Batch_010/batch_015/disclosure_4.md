## Dynamic Media Persona Synthesis

**Concept:** Extend real-time media processing to not just *alter* media but to dynamically synthesize entirely new media "personas" overlaid onto existing streams, tailored to recipient emotional state or pre-defined interaction profiles.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Real-time video & audio streams (source device), recipient biofeedback data (heart rate, facial expressions, potentially EEG data – optional, via wearable or device camera), pre-defined interaction profiles (stored locally or remotely).
*   **Persona Library:** A database of parameterized “personas” – combinations of:
    *   **Visual Avatars:** 3D models or 2D sprites with adjustable morphology, texture, and animation.  These aren’t replacements for the source video, but overlays – think augmented reality filters taken to the extreme. Parameters: age, gender expression, emotional state (joy, sadness, anger, etc.), style (e.g., steampunk, futuristic).
    *   **Voice Modulation Profiles:**  Algorithms to alter voice pitch, timbre, speed, and add effects (reverb, echo).  Parameters: age, gender, accent, emotional inflection.
    *   **Behavioral Scripts:**  Rules governing avatar actions (gestures, gaze direction, micro-expressions) and voice modulation timing based on source audio and recipient biofeedback.
*   **Biofeedback Integration Module:**  Real-time analysis of recipient biofeedback data.  Mapping of biofeedback signals to emotional states (e.g., increased heart rate = excitement/stress).
*   **Persona Selection & Blending Engine:**
    *   Algorithm to select an appropriate persona based on:
        *   Pre-defined interaction profile (e.g., a "supportive friend" persona for a distressed recipient).
        *   Real-time emotional state of recipient (detected via biofeedback).
        *   Content of source media (analysis of audio/video to identify themes/mood).
    *   Blending algorithm to smoothly transition between personas.
    *   Dynamic parameter adjustment:  Real-time modification of persona parameters (e.g., avatar facial expressions, voice modulation) based on ongoing biofeedback and content analysis.
*   **Rendering/Encoding Pipeline:** High-performance rendering engine to composite the source video, avatar overlays, and modified audio.  Real-time encoding to a streaming format.

**Pseudocode (Persona Selection & Blending):**

```
// Input: recipient_biofeedback, source_media_analysis, interaction_profile

function select_persona(biofeedback, media_analysis, profile):
  emotional_state = analyze_biofeedback(biofeedback)
  media_mood = analyze_media(media_analysis)

  // Priority 1: Interaction Profile (strongest influence)
  if profile.preferred_persona:
    return profile.preferred_persona

  // Priority 2: Emotional Match (moderate influence)
  if emotional_state == "sad":
    persona = "empathetic_friend"
  else if emotional_state == "angry":
    persona = "calming_presence"
  else if media_mood == "joyful":
    persona = "playful_companion"
  else:
    persona = "neutral_observer"

  return persona

function blend_personas(current_persona, target_persona, blend_speed):
  // Smoothly transition between persona parameters
  for each parameter in [visuals, voice, behavior]:
    current_value = get_parameter_value(current_persona, parameter)
    target_value = get_parameter_value(target_persona, parameter)
    new_value = lerp(current_value, target_value, blend_speed)
    set_parameter_value(current_persona, parameter, new_value)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Communication:**  Adaptable communication styles based on recipient emotional state.
*   **Therapeutic Interventions:**  Personalized virtual companions for mental health support.
*   **Immersive Entertainment:**  Dynamic character interaction in games and virtual reality experiences.
*   **Accessibility:**  Customizable communication aids for individuals with disabilities.
