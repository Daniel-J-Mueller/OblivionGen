## Dynamic Persona-Driven Content Stitching

**Concept:** Leverage aggregated user data, not just for content *delivery*, but for real-time content *construction*. Instead of serving pre-built pages, the system dynamically stitches together content fragments – text, images, videos, interactive elements – based on a constantly evolving ‘persona’ derived from aggregated data.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Engine:**
    *   Input: Aggregated data streams (browsing history, purchase history, location data, social media activity - opt-in only, contextual data – time of day, device type, weather).
    *   Process:  Employ a multi-layered weighting system.  Immediate behavioral data (current session activity) receives highest weight, declining over time. Demographic/profile data receives lowest weight, serving as a baseline.  Machine learning models continuously refine the weighting based on user engagement (clicks, time on page, conversions).  Output: A dynamic ‘persona vector’ representing the user’s current interests, needs, and emotional state.
*   **Content Fragment Repository:**
    *   Structure: Content is broken down into reusable fragments – "atoms" – categorized by topic, sentiment, function (e.g., headline, body text, image, call to action). Each fragment is tagged with metadata describing its content, target audience, and appropriate context.
    *   Version Control: Maintain multiple versions of each fragment, allowing for A/B testing and personalization.
*   **Stitching Engine:**
    *   Input: Persona vector, request for a page (e.g., product page, blog post), predefined page templates.
    *   Process:
        1.  **Template Selection:** Choose a base template based on the requested page type.
        2.  **Fragment Retrieval:** Query the content fragment repository, filtering by tags that match the persona vector.
        3.  **Fragment Scoring:** Rank retrieved fragments based on relevance to the persona vector. Employ a scoring algorithm that considers multiple factors: keyword matching, semantic similarity, sentiment alignment.
        4.  **Dynamic Assembly:** Populate the selected template with the highest-scoring fragments.  Implement a "coherence engine" to ensure the assembled content flows logically and maintains a consistent tone.
        5.  **Real-time Adaptation:** Monitor user engagement with the assembled page.  If engagement is low, dynamically swap out fragments with alternative options.

**Pseudocode (Stitching Engine):**

```
function stitchPage(personaVector, pageRequest, template):
  fragments = getContentFragments(personaVector, pageRequest)
  scoredFragments = scoreFragments(fragments, personaVector)
  assembledPage = populateTemplate(template, scoredFragments)
  
  while (userEngagementLow(assembledPage)):
    alternativeFragments = getAlternativeFragments(scoredFragments)
    assembledPage = swapFragments(assembledPage, scoredFragments, alternativeFragments)
    
  return assembledPage
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond static personalization to *generative* content creation, delivering a truly unique experience for each user, in real-time. This system enables extreme levels of A/B testing, as minor adjustments to content fragments can be instantly deployed and measured. Enables 'micro-content' strategies, with highly granular content targeting.
