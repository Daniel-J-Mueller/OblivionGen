**Personalized Interactive Broadcast Experiences**

**Specification:** A system for dynamically altering broadcast media *content* – not just advertisements – based on real-time user data and interactive input. 

**Core Concept:** Move beyond ad replacement to full scene/character alteration, leveraging AI to seamlessly integrate user preferences *into* the broadcast itself.

**Components:**

*   **Real-time Data Feed:** Integrates user data from multiple sources – purchase history (as in the patent), browsing history, social media activity, location, biometrics (if opted-in via wearable devices), and *real-time* emotional response (analyzed via camera input – opt-in required).
*   **AI Content Engine:**  A generative AI model trained on the broadcast content's assets (characters, environments, dialogue, music).  This engine can modify scenes *on the fly* based on user data.
*   **Interactive Layer:** Allows users to exert *direct* influence over the broadcast via simple input methods (voice commands, button presses, gaze tracking).
*   **Seamless Integration Module:** Ensures modifications are visually and aurally coherent with the existing broadcast content.
*   **Networked Storage & Delivery:** Modified broadcasts are streamed to the client device.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION ProcessBroadcast(broadcastStream, userData, interactiveInput)

    // 1. Analyze User Data
    userProfile = AnalyzeUserData(userData)
    preferredGenre = userProfile.preferredGenre
    preferredActors = userProfile.preferredActors
    emotionalState = userProfile.emotionalState

    // 2. Analyze Broadcast Content (Scene by Scene)
    currentScene = GetCurrentScene(broadcastStream)

    // 3. Determine Modification Level (Based on User Preference & Scene Context)
    modificationLevel = DetermineModificationLevel(currentScene, modificationLevel, emotionalState, preferredGenre)

    // 4. AI Content Modification
    IF modificationLevel > 0 THEN
        modifiedScene = AIContentEngine.ModifyScene(currentScene, preferredActors, emotionalState)
    ELSE
        modifiedScene = currentScene
    ENDIF

    // 5. Interactive Input Handling
    IF interactiveInput.received THEN
        modifiedScene = HandleInteractiveInput(modifiedScene, interactiveInput)
    ENDIF

    // 6. Seamless Integration & Delivery
    finalScene = SeamlessIntegrationModule.Integrate(modifiedScene)
    Deliver(finalScene)

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION HandleInteractiveInput(scene, input)
    //Example: User says “More action!” – increase tempo, add visual effects
    IF input.command == "More action" THEN
        scene.tempo = scene.tempo * 1.2
        scene.visualEffects = AddVisualEffects(scene.visualEffects, "explosions")
    ENDIF
    RETURN scene
END FUNCTION
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Personalized Storytelling:** Change character motivations, plot points, or endings based on user preferences.
*   **Interactive Sports Viewing:**  Allow users to change camera angles, replay highlights, or even influence in-game decisions (in simulations).
*   **Dynamic Educational Content:**  Adjust the pace, complexity, and examples used based on the student’s learning style and progress.
*   **Adaptive Entertainment:** Modify the mood, genre, or themes of a broadcast to match the user’s emotional state.
