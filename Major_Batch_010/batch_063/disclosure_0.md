## Dynamic Predictive Failure Mapping with Multi-Dimensional Graph Weighting

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A module integrated with the existing data center graph analysis system, designated “Predictive Failure Mapper (PFM).”
*   **Data Input:**
    *   Real-time sensor data: Temperature, power draw, network latency, vibration, fan speed, etc., for all monitored components.
    *   Historical failure data: Records of past failures, component type, root cause, and time to failure.
    *   Component specifications: Manufacturer data, MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures), and known failure modes.
    *   Workload data: Current and projected resource utilization for each component (CPU, memory, network).
*   **Graph Modification:** The existing data center graphs (physical and operational) are augmented with *dynamic weights* assigned to each edge (connection) and node (component).
    *   **Node Weights:** Calculated based on:
        *   Current workload (higher workload = higher weight).
        *   Real-time sensor data (deviation from baseline = higher weight).
        *   Historical failure rate for that component type.
        *   Age of the component.
    *   **Edge Weights:** Calculated based on:
        *   Bandwidth utilization.
        *   Latency.
        *   Criticality of the connection (e.g., a connection to a core switch has higher weight).
        *   Combined node weights of connected components.
*   **Failure Prediction Algorithm:** A modified Dijkstra’s algorithm is employed to identify potential failure paths.
    *   The algorithm traverses the weighted graph, seeking the lowest “cost” path from a given component to critical infrastructure.
    *   “Cost” is the sum of edge and node weights along the path.
    *   Paths with high cumulative cost are flagged as potential failure points.
*   **Predictive Visualization:**
    *   A dynamic overlay on the existing data center topology maps, highlighting high-risk paths.
    *   Color-coding to indicate the severity of the risk (e.g., green = low, yellow = medium, red = high).
    *   Interactive drill-down capability to view sensor data and historical failure information for the components along the flagged path.
*   **Alerting System:**
    *   Configurable thresholds for risk levels.
    *   Automated alerts sent to relevant personnel when a high-risk path is identified.
    *   Alerts include details of the potential failure path, affected components, and recommended actions.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Failure Path Identification):**

```
function find_failure_path(starting_component, critical_infrastructure):
  // Initialize distances to infinity for all components
  distances = {component: infinity for component in graph.nodes}
  distances[starting_component] = 0

  // Priority queue to store components to visit, sorted by distance
  priority_queue = [(0, starting_component)]

  while priority_queue is not empty:
    (distance, current_component) = priority_queue.pop()

    if current_component == critical_infrastructure:
      return reconstruct_path(came_from, critical_infrastructure)

    for neighbor, weight in graph.edges[current_component].items():
      new_distance = distance + weight + node_weight(neighbor) 
      if new_distance < distances[neighbor]:
        distances[neighbor] = new_distance
        came_from[neighbor] = current_component
        priority_queue.append((new_distance, neighbor))

  return None // No path found
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simple dependency mapping and incorporates *dynamic weighting* based on real-time data and predictive analytics to identify potential failure paths *before* they occur. It is not merely reacting to failures, but *proactively* anticipating them. The algorithm allows for a more granular risk assessment, which may provide greater opportunity for optimization.
