## Adaptive Haptic Gesture Mapping

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Haptic feedback array integrated into a device screen (phone, tablet, laptop trackpad). Array density configurable during manufacturing (e.g., 50-200 actuators/inch²).  Dedicated haptic processing unit (HPU) co-processor.  High-resolution touch sensor array.
*   **Software:** Operating System level haptic service. Application Programming Interface (API) for applications to access haptic features. Machine Learning (ML) model for gesture recognition and prediction. Cloud connectivity for sharing and updating gesture profiles.

**Innovation Description:**

This system allows users to dynamically map gestures to haptic feedback patterns, creating personalized and intuitive control schemes.  Instead of pre-defined gestures, the system *learns* the user's natural hand movements during interaction, associating them with device actions.

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  **Calibration:** Upon first use (or user request), the system enters a calibration mode.  The user is prompted to perform a series of natural hand movements on the screen.  The touch sensor captures the movement trajectory, pressure, and speed. The HPU records the associated haptic data.
2.  **Gesture Profile Creation:**  The ML model analyzes the captured data, identifying distinct movement patterns and creating a personalized gesture profile. This profile maps each movement to a unique haptic signature.
3.  **Dynamic Mapping:** As the user interacts with the device, the system continuously analyzes their movements. When a movement matches a pattern in the gesture profile, the corresponding haptic signature is activated.
4.  **Action Association:** The user can then associate these haptic gestures with specific device actions (e.g., volume control, app launch, scrolling). This association is stored in the gesture profile.
5.  **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously monitors the user's interactions, refining the gesture profile over time.  If a movement is frequently misinterpreted, the system prompts the user to re-calibrate that gesture.  Rarely used gestures are automatically archived to reduce memory usage.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
ON DEVICE STARTUP:
    Load User Gesture Profile (if exists)
    IF Profile Does Not Exist:
        Enter Calibration Mode

// Calibration Mode
WHILE Calibration Mode Active:
    Display instructions for performing gestures
    Capture Touch Data (trajectory, pressure, speed)
    Analyze Data (using ML model)
    Create/Update Gesture Profile
    Prompt User to Confirm/Refine Gesture

// Runtime
ON TOUCH EVENT:
    Capture Touch Data
    Match Data to Gesture Profile (using ML model)
    IF Match Found:
        Activate Corresponding Haptic Signature
        Determine Associated Device Action
        Perform Device Action
    ELSE:
        Log Unrecognized Gesture
        IF Frequency of Unrecognized Gestures Exceeds Threshold:
            Prompt User to Re-calibrate
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Social Gestures:**  Allow users to share their gesture profiles with friends and family.
*   **Context-Aware Gestures:**  Adjust gesture mappings based on the current application or device state.
*   **AI-Powered Gesture Suggestion:**  The system can suggest new gestures based on the user’s usage patterns.
