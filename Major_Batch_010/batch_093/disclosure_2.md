## Dynamic Template Stitching for Composite Services

**Concept:** Extend the version-specific template approach to enable the creation of dynamic, composite services assembled from multiple underlying services, each with potentially different versions. Instead of a single template per version, maintain template *fragments* and a dependency graph defining how they are stitched together to form a complete response.

**Specifications:**

**1. Template Fragment Repository:**

*   A storage mechanism (database, file system) to store reusable template fragments.
*   Each fragment is tagged with:
    *   Service ID (identifies the service the fragment belongs to).
    *   Version range (specifies the versions this fragment is compatible with – e.g., 1.0-1.2, 2.0+).
    *   Input/Output schema (defines the data expected by and produced by the fragment).
    *   Dependency IDs (references other fragment IDs required for this fragment to function).
    *   Fragment Type (defines the role of the fragment: e.g., Header, Body, Footer, Data Transformation, Error Handling).

**2. Composite Service Definition:**

*   A mechanism to define composite services as graphs of interconnected template fragments.
*   Each node in the graph represents a template fragment ID.
*   Edges represent data flow and dependencies between fragments.
*   The composite service definition includes:
    *   Entry point fragment ID.
    *   Target service version(s).
    *   Data mapping rules (transforms data between fragment schemas).

**3. Request Processing Flow:**

1.  Receive request including service ID and desired version.
2.  Retrieve the appropriate composite service definition based on service ID and version.
3.  Instantiate the composite service graph.
4.  For each fragment in the graph:
    *   Resolve the latest compatible fragment version based on version range.
    *   Fetch the fragment from the repository.
    *   Populate the fragment with data from upstream fragments or initial request data, applying data mapping rules as needed.
5.  Assemble the populated fragments into a complete response.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processRequest(request, serviceId, version) {
  compositeService = getCompositeService(serviceId, version);

  graph = compositeService.graph;
  fragmentRepository = getFragmentRepository();

  populatedFragments = {};

  function populateFragment(fragmentId) {
    if (populatedFragments[fragmentId]) {
      return populatedFragments[fragmentId];
    }

    fragment = fragmentRepository.getFragment(fragmentId);

    dependencies = fragment.dependencies;

    dependencyData = {};
    for (depId in dependencies) {
      dependencyData[depId] = populateFragment(depId);
    }

    populatedFragment = populate(fragment, dependencyData);
    populatedFragments[fragmentId] = populatedFragment;
    return populatedFragment;
  }

  finalResponse = populateFragment(compositeService.entryPoint);
  return finalResponse;
}
```

**4. Metadata Enhancements:**

*   Add metadata to fragments to support conditional execution (e.g., “if user role is admin, include this section”).
*   Support A/B testing by defining multiple fragment versions for the same element.
*   Enable dynamic content injection (e.g., pull data from external APIs within a fragment).

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased flexibility and agility in service development.
*   Reduced code duplication and maintenance effort.
*   Simplified version management for complex services.
*   Improved ability to adapt to changing business requirements.
*   Facilitates composition of microservices into larger, cohesive services.
