## Dynamic Content Stitching for Personalized Live Streams

**System Overview:** A system to dynamically assemble live stream content based on real-time user preferences and context, going beyond simple ad insertion to create truly personalized viewing experiences. The core innovation lies in creating a 'content graph' and a 'preference vector' to guide stream assembly.

**Components:**

1.  **Content Ingestion & Segmentation:** Ingests multiple live streams (sports, news, entertainment) and segments them into short, meaningful 'content units' (e.g., a play in football, a news segment, a musical interlude). Each unit is tagged with metadata describing its content, sentiment, key players, location, and estimated duration.

2.  **User Preference Modeling:**  Creates a multi-dimensional 'preference vector' for each user, capturing their interests, viewing history, social media activity (with permission), and current context (time of day, location, activity). This vector is dynamically updated based on real-time viewing behavior. Uses a weighted scoring system for features to capture the degree of preference.

3.  **Content Graph Construction:**  Builds a graph where nodes represent content units and edges represent potential transitions between units. Edge weights are determined by content similarity (using semantic analysis of metadata) and user preference (higher weight for units that align with the user's preference vector). 

4.  **Stream Assembly Engine:**  A real-time engine that traverses the content graph, selecting content units to assemble a personalized stream.  The engine uses a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize stream assembly based on user engagement metrics (watch time, clicks, shares). The algorithm rewards selections that maximize engagement and penalizes selections that lead to disengagement.

5.  **Dynamic Ad Insertion & Sponsorship Integration:** Seamlessly integrates ads and sponsored content into the personalized stream, ensuring relevance to the user's interests and the current content.

**Pseudocode (Stream Assembly Engine):**

```
function assembleStream(userProfile, contentGraph):
  stream = []
  currentUnit = startingUnit(userProfile, contentGraph) // Select an initial unit based on user profile

  while (streamDuration < targetStreamDuration):
    candidates = findNextUnits(currentUnit, contentGraph) // Find potential next units

    // Score candidates based on:
    //   - User Preference (dot product of unit features and user preference vector)
    //   - Transition Probability (edge weight in content graph)
    //   - Content Diversity (avoid repetition)
    scoredCandidates = scoreCandidates(candidates)

    nextUnit = selectNextUnit(scoredCandidates, explorationRate) // Select unit with highest score (or explore random options)

    stream.append(nextUnit)
    currentUnit = nextUnit

  return stream
```
