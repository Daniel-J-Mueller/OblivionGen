## Adaptive Test Orchestration via Predictive Failure Injection

**Concept:** Enhance testing by proactively injecting *predicted* failures *before* they occur, enabling the runner agent to gracefully handle anticipated disruptions and refine test execution paths. This moves beyond reactive resumption and towards proactive adaptation.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive Failure Engine (PFE):**

*   **Input:** Real-time system metrics (CPU load, memory usage, network latency, disk I/O), historical test data (failure rates, common failure points), and system logs.
*   **Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) trained to predict potential failures within a specified time window (e.g., next 5-30 seconds). The model outputs a probability score for various failure types (e.g., network timeout, disk full, memory leak, process crash).
*   **Output:**  A prioritized list of predicted failure types and the estimated time to failure.  A "confidence score" is also outputted.

**2.  Runner Agent Modification:**

*   **Interception Layer:** The runner agent will include a new interception layer that monitors the PFE output.
*   **Preemptive Handling:** When the PFE indicates a high-confidence impending failure:
    *   The runner agent *before* the failure occurs will initiate a "safe state" procedure. This could involve:
        *   Saving critical test data to durable storage.
        *   Checkpointing the test execution state.
        *   Initiating redundant operations (e.g., retrying network requests).
        *   Preparing for a controlled shutdown of the affected component.
    *   A signal is sent to the test orchestration system indicating a preemptive handling event, including the predicted failure type and the actions taken.
*   **Adaptive Test Path Selection:** Based on the preemptive handling event and the current test state, the orchestration system can dynamically adjust the test execution path. This could involve:
    *   Skipping potentially problematic test steps.
    *   Rerouting traffic to a backup system.
    *   Initiating a failover procedure.
*   **Failure Injection Override:**  The system includes an option for *intentional* failure injection to validate the preemptive handling mechanisms. This allows engineers to simulate predicted failures and verify that the runner agent responds correctly.

**3. Orchestration System Integration:**

*   **Failure Event Reporting:** The orchestration system receives detailed reports on preemptive handling events, including predicted failure types, actions taken, and test execution results.
*   **Test Path Management:** The system dynamically updates the test execution path based on failure event reports.
*   **Machine Learning Feedback Loop:** Data from failure events is used to retrain the PFE model, improving its accuracy over time.  This creates a closed-loop system for adaptive testing.

**Pseudocode (Runner Agent - Interception Layer):**

```
while (running) {
  failurePredictions = PFE.getPredictions();

  for each prediction in failurePredictions {
    if (prediction.confidence > threshold) {
      // Initiate safe state procedure
      saveTestState();
      checkpointExecution();
      // Perform redundant operations (e.g., retry network requests)
      reportPreemptiveHandling(prediction.type);
      // Await instruction from orchestration system
      newTestPath = orchestrationSystem.getNextStep();
    }
  }

  // Continue test execution
  executeNextStep();
}
```

**Data Stores:**

*   **PFE Model Store:** Stores trained machine learning models for failure prediction.
*   **Test State Database:** Stores checkpointed test states for resumption.
*   **Failure Event Log:** Stores detailed logs of preemptive handling events for analysis and model retraining.
