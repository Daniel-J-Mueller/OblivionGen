## Adaptive Resource Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the permissioning system to incorporate dynamic, AI-driven "resource personas" that automatically adjust permissions based on observed user behavior and resource state. This moves beyond static user group assignments to a continuously adapting security profile.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Definition & Observation Module:**

*   **Input:** User ID, Managed Resource ID, User Actions (command execution, data access, session activity), Resource State (CPU load, memory usage, network traffic, security alerts).
*   **Process:**
    *   AI model (Reinforcement Learning or Bayesian Network preferred) analyzes user actions and resource state.
    *   The model identifies behavioral patterns and correlates them with risk levels.
    *   Based on analysis, the system assigns a dynamic "Persona Score" to the user for that specific resource. Persona Scores range from 1 (least privilege) to 10 (maximum configured access).
*   **Output:** Persona Score (integer 1-10) per user/resource combination. Timestamp of last score update.

**2. Permission Mapping Service:**

*   **Input:** Persona Score, Resource ID, Static User Group (from existing patent system).
*   **Process:**
    *   A configurable mapping table translates Persona Scores into specific permission sets.
    *   The mapping combines the dynamic Persona Score with the baseline permissions granted by the userâ€™s static group.
    *   Example:
        *   Score 1-3: Read-only access.
        *   Score 4-6: Standard operational permissions (as defined in the static group).
        *   Score 7-8: Elevated permissions (e.g., ability to restart services).
        *   Score 9-10: Root/Administrator access (with logging and auditing).
*   **Output:** Dynamically generated permission set for the user/resource combination.

**3.  Runtime Enforcement Agent (Augmented Systems-Manager Agent):**

*   **Input:** User Command, Resource ID, User ID, Dynamic Permission Set.
*   **Process:**
    *   Intercepts all user commands before execution.
    *   Validates the command against the dynamic permission set.
    *   If the command is permitted, it is executed. Otherwise, it is blocked and logged.
*   **Output:** Command execution or denial with audit log entry.

**4.  Anomaly Detection & Persona Adjustment:**

*   **Input:** User Actions, Resource State, Persona Score.
*   **Process:**
    *   Continuously monitors user behavior for anomalies (e.g., unusual commands, excessive resource consumption).
    *   If an anomaly is detected, the system temporarily adjusts the Persona Score downwards (reducing permissions).
    *   A human operator can review the anomaly and either approve the action (restoring permissions) or permanently ban the user.

**Pseudocode (Runtime Enforcement Agent):**

```
function enforcePermission(userCommand, resourceId, userId, permissionSet):
  if userCommand in permissionSet:
    execute(userCommand)
    log(userId, resourceId, userCommand, "permitted")
    return true
  else:
    log(userId, resourceId, userCommand, "denied")
    return false
```

**Infrastructure Requirements:**

*   Scalable database to store Persona Scores and audit logs.
*   Real-time analytics pipeline to process user actions and resource state.
*   Secure communication channels between all components.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased security by dynamically adapting permissions to user behavior.
*   Reduced risk of insider threats and compromised accounts.
*   Improved compliance with security regulations.
*   Enhanced user experience by providing just-in-time access to resources.
