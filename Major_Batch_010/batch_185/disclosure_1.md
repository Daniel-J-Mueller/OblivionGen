## Predictive Model ‘Shadowing’ with Synthetic Data Injection

**Concept:** Extend the prediction model testing framework to proactively ‘shadow’ production models by running a parallel, synthetic data-augmented PMUT. This allows for near real-time comparison & drift detection *before* issues impact live service, and allows exploration of ‘what if’ scenarios.

**Specification:**

**1. Synthetic Data Generator (SDG):**

*   **Input:** Production data schema, historical production data, observed data distributions.
*   **Process:** Generate synthetic data mirroring production data characteristics. Utilize techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) trained on historical data to create realistic but artificial data points.  Introduce controlled ‘noise’ and edge cases.
*   **Output:** Synthetic data streams formatted identically to production data.  Maintain metadata linking synthetic data to its generation parameters (noise level, edge case type).

**2. Shadow PMUT Pipeline:**

*   **Input:** Combined data stream – Production Data + Synthetic Data. PMUT.
*   **Process:**
    *   Data is ingested by PMUT.
    *   PMUT generates predictions on the combined stream, identical to the production predictor.
    *   Predictions are *not* used in production. They are directed to a dedicated comparison engine.
*   **Output:** PMUT predictions for all ingested data. Performance metrics for PMUT.

**3. Comparison Engine:**

*   **Input:** Production Predictor Predictions. Shadow PMUT Predictions. Observed Data (from production).
*   **Process:**
    *   Compare production and PMUT predictions for both real and synthetic data.
    *   Calculate prediction error metrics (RMSE, MAE, etc.) for both.
    *   Analyze differences in prediction distributions.
    *   Detect statistically significant drifts in performance.
    *   Identify instances where PMUT predicts significantly different outcomes than production, highlighting potential anomalies or vulnerabilities.  Filter by synthetic data to prioritize 'edge case' alerts.
*   **Output:** Drift detection alerts. Anomaly reports. Performance comparison dashboards.  "What if" analysis visualizations.

**4.  Alerting and Feedback Loop:**

*   **Alerting:**  Configure thresholds for drift detection metrics. Trigger alerts when thresholds are exceeded, indicating potential issues with the production model.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Integrate feedback from the comparison engine to refine the synthetic data generator and PMUT training process. Adjust generation parameters to focus on edge cases where the PMUT consistently deviates from production.  Automatically retrain the PMUT with updated synthetic data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
# SDG Process
function generate_synthetic_data(historical_data, noise_level, edge_case_type):
  # Train GAN/VAE on historical_data
  model = train_generative_model(historical_data)
  # Generate synthetic data based on model & parameters
  synthetic_data = generate_data(model, noise_level, edge_case_type)
  return synthetic_data

# Shadow PMUT Pipeline
function process_data(data_stream, PMUT):
  predictions = PMUT.predict(data_stream)
  return predictions

# Comparison Engine
function compare_predictions(production_predictions, PMUT_predictions, observed_data):
  error_production = calculate_error(production_predictions, observed_data)
  error_PMUT = calculate_error(PMUT_predictions, observed_data)
  drift = calculate_drift(error_production, error_PMUT)
  # Filter for drift events originating from synthetic data
  synthetic_drift = filter_drift_by_source(drift, 'synthetic')
  return synthetic_drift
```

**Infrastructure Requirements:**

*   Dedicated computing resources for the SDG, Shadow PMUT Pipeline, and Comparison Engine.
*   High-bandwidth data pipelines to ingest and process data in near real-time.
*   Scalable storage for historical data, synthetic data, and model artifacts.
*   Monitoring and alerting infrastructure to track performance and detect anomalies.
