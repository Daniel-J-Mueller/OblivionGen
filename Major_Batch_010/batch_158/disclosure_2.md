## Adaptive Reputation Scoring & Predictive Mitigation

**Concept:** Extend the existing detection mechanism by incorporating a dynamic reputation scoring system for source network addresses, coupled with predictive mitigation based on trending reputation data. This moves beyond reactive blocking/limiting to proactive shaping of traffic *before* a full-scale attack manifests.

**Specifications:**

**1. Reputation Scoring Engine:**

*   **Input:** Raw packet data (source/destination IP, port, packet size, flags, frequency), historical mitigation actions (e.g., limits imposed, durations), and external threat intelligence feeds (optional, for initial seeding).
*   **Scoring Factors:**
    *   **Packet Rate:**  Baseline established per source IP. Significant deviations (calculated using standard deviation or similar) contribute to negative reputation.
    *   **SYN/ACK Ratio:** High SYN flood attempts negatively impact reputation.
    *   **Error Rate:**  High ICMP errors (Destination Unreachable, Time Exceeded) directed *to* the server, originating from the source IP, indicate potential spoofing/amplification attempts.
    *   **Geolocation Consistency:** Track geolocation of source IP. Frequent geolocation changes within short intervals raise suspicion.
    *   **Historical Mitigation:**  Repeated triggering of mitigation actions (rate limiting, blocking) negatively impacts the score.
*   **Scoring Algorithm:** Weighted sum of the above factors, normalized to a score between 0 (trusted) and 100 (highly suspicious). The weights can be dynamically adjusted based on observed attack patterns.
*   **Decay Mechanism:** Reputation scores decay over time to account for legitimate traffic fluctuations. The decay rate is configurable.

**2. Predictive Mitigation Module:**

*   **Trending Analysis:** Continuously monitors reputation score trends for source IPs.
*   **Thresholds:**  Defines multiple thresholds:
    *   **Low Alert:**  Reputation score exceeds a low threshold. Logging and basic monitoring increased.
    *   **Medium Warning:** Score exceeds medium threshold.  Adaptive shaping applied â€“  TCP Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) enabled, initial congestion window (IW) reduced.
    *   **High Critical:** Score exceeds high threshold.  Full rate limiting/blocking applied.
*   **Adaptive Shaping:**  Instead of abrupt blocking, adjust network parameters to subtly reduce the impact of potentially malicious traffic.
    *   **TCP SACK:** Improves congestion control and reduces retransmissions, mitigating amplification attacks.
    *   **IW Reduction:** Limits the initial burst of traffic from the source IP, slowing down rapid escalation.
*   **Automated Learning:**  The system learns from mitigation actions.  Successful actions increase the weight of corresponding scoring factors. False positives decrease weights.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Integrate with server performance monitoring to correlate mitigation actions with server load. This helps refine the scoring algorithm and thresholds.

**3.  Implementation Details:**

*   **Data Structure:**  Use a bloom filter to efficiently store and query reputation scores for millions of source IPs.
*   **Processing:** Implement the scoring and mitigation logic within a high-performance packet processing engine (e.g., DPDK, XDP).
*   **API:** Provide an API to access reputation scores, configure thresholds, and monitor mitigation actions.
*   **Visualization:**  Create a dashboard to visualize reputation trends, mitigation statistics, and system performance.



**Pseudocode (Simplified Scoring):**

```
function calculate_reputation(source_ip):
  score = 0
  packet_rate_deviation = calculate_packet_rate_deviation(source_ip)
  syn_ack_ratio = calculate_syn_ack_ratio(source_ip)
  error_rate = calculate_error_rate(source_ip)

  score += packet_rate_deviation * WEIGHT_PACKET_RATE
  score += syn_ack_ratio * WEIGHT_SYN_ACK
  score += error_rate * WEIGHT_ERROR_RATE

  # Apply Decay
  score *= DECAY_FACTOR

  return min(100, max(0, score)) // Normalize between 0 and 100
```
