## Adaptive Pixel Grouping for Enhanced Motion Detection

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on detecting motion via pixel differences. This design expands on that by *grouping* pixels based on visual similarity *before* applying difference calculations. This allows for detection of subtle, complex motions that might be lost in single-pixel analysis, and drastically reduces noise.

**Specifications:**

**1. Pre-Processing - Visual Similarity Grouping:**

*   **Algorithm:** Utilize a modified Mean Shift algorithm for pixel grouping.
    *   Input: Raw video frame (grayscale or color).
    *   Parameters:
        *   *Spatial Radius (sr)*: Defines the search radius for neighboring pixels (e.g., 5-10 pixels).
        *   *Color/Intensity Radius (cr)*: Defines the similarity threshold for color/intensity values (e.g., 10-20 for 8-bit grayscale).  Adaptive based on image histogram.
        *   *Minimum Group Size (mgs)*:  The minimum number of pixels required to form a valid group (e.g., 5-15).
    *   Process:
        1.  For each pixel in the frame:
            a.  Initialize a 'group' with the current pixel.
            b.  Search within the *Spatial Radius* for neighboring pixels.
            c.  If a neighboring pixel’s color/intensity difference from the current pixel is less than the *Color/Intensity Radius*, add it to the ‘group’.
            d. Repeat c until no more qualifying neighboring pixels are found.
        2.  If the ‘group’ size is less than the *Minimum Group Size*, assign the pixel to a ‘noise’ category.
        3.  Create a new image where each pixel represents a unique ‘group ID’. Pixels assigned to 'noise' are marked as 0.
*   **Output:**  A ‘group image’ where each connected region represents a group of visually similar pixels.

**2. Motion Analysis – Group-Based Difference:**

*   **Input:**  A current frame and a previous frame, *both* processed through the Visual Similarity Grouping step to generate corresponding ‘group images’.
*   **Process:**
    1.  For each ‘group ID’ in the current frame's group image:
        a.  Find the corresponding group in the previous frame’s group image based on ID. If no matching ID exists, mark the group as 'new motion'.
        b.  Calculate the *average* color/intensity value for all pixels within the group in both frames.
        c.  Calculate the difference between these average values.
        d.  If the difference exceeds a *Motion Threshold*, mark the group as ‘motion detected’.
*   **Output:** A ‘motion map’ where each connected region represents an area of detected motion.

**3. Post-Processing – Motion Filtering & Characterization:**

*   **Motion Size Filtering:** Discard any ‘motion regions’ in the motion map that are smaller than a *Minimum Motion Area* (e.g., 50 pixels) to reduce false positives.
*   **Motion Velocity Estimation:**  Track the displacement of motion regions between consecutive frames to estimate velocity.
*   **Motion Pattern Recognition:**  Employ a simple pattern recognition algorithm (e.g., template matching) to identify common motion patterns (e.g., waving, walking).

**Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Pre-processing: Visual Similarity Grouping
function groupPixels(frame, spatialRadius, colorRadius, minGroupSize):
  groupImage = new image with same dimensions as frame
  for each pixel in frame:
    group = new group containing current pixel
    for each neighboring pixel within spatialRadius:
      if colorDifference(current pixel, neighboring pixel) < colorRadius:
        add neighboring pixel to group
    if size of group < minGroupSize:
      mark pixel as noise (0)
    else:
      assign unique group ID to all pixels in group
  return groupImage

// Motion Analysis: Group-Based Difference
function detectMotion(currentFrame, previousFrame):
  currentGroupImage = groupPixels(currentFrame, ...)
  previousGroupImage = groupPixels(previousFrame, ...)
  motionMap = new image with same dimensions as currentFrame
  for each group ID in currentGroupImage:
    find matching group ID in previousGroupImage
    if no matching ID:
      mark group as new motion
    else:
      calculate average color/intensity for group in current and previous frames
      difference = abs(currentAverage - previousAverage)
      if difference > motionThreshold:
        mark group as motion detected
  return motionMap
```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   **Adaptive Thresholding:** Dynamically adjust the *Motion Threshold* based on lighting conditions and background noise.
*   **3D Grouping:** Extend the grouping algorithm to incorporate temporal information, creating 3D ‘motion blobs’ that represent continuous motion over time.
*   **AI integration:** Use AI to dynamically adjust parameters and filter out false positives.
