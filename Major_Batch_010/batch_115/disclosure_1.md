## Secure Ephemeral Key Exchange via Bio-Signal Authentication

**Concept:** Leverage unique, continuously generated bio-signals (ECG, EEG, GSR) as inputs to a Key Derivation Function (KDF) to generate ephemeral cryptographic keys. Authentication is intrinsically tied to the *current* state of the user, rendering replay attacks impossible.

**Specifications:**

**1. Bio-Signal Acquisition Module:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrated sensors for ECG (electrocardiogram), EEG (electroencephalogram), and GSR (galvanic skin response). Multi-modal input increases robustness and security.
*   **Sampling Rate:** ECG: 500Hz, EEG: 256Hz, GSR: 32Hz. Adjustable parameters for performance/accuracy trade-offs.
*   **Signal Conditioning:** Analog front-end with noise filtering, amplification, and digitization (16-bit ADC).
*   **Interface:** USB-C or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for data transmission to the processing unit.

**2. Key Derivation Function (KDF) Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time bio-signal data streams (ECG, EEG, GSR) and a pre-shared secret (e.g., derived from user password/PIN).
*   **Algorithm:** Hybrid KDF combining:
    *   **ChaCha20/Poly1305:** For efficient symmetric encryption/authentication.
    *   **HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function):** For robust key extraction and expansion.
    *   **Bio-Signal Entropy Measurement:** Calculate entropy of bio-signal data within a sliding window. Incorporate entropy value into HKDF salt.  This ensures key uniqueness based on *current* physiological state.
*   **Key Length:** Adjustable, up to 256 bits.
*   **Key Update Rate:** Configurable, from 1 Hz to 60 Hz. Frequent updates mitigate risks from prolonged compromise.
*   **Window Size:** Define the length of bio-signal data used for key derivation. Experiment with values from 0.5s to 5s.
*   **Pseudo-Code:**

```
function deriveKey(bioSignalData, preSharedSecret, windowSize, updateRate):
  // Calculate entropy of bioSignalData within windowSize
  entropy = calculateEntropy(bioSignalData)

  // Concatenate preSharedSecret and entropy as salt
  salt = preSharedSecret + entropy

  // Use HKDF to derive key from salt and info (optional)
  derivedKey = HKDF(salt, info, keyLength)

  return derivedKey
```

**3. Secure Communication Module:**

*   **Encryption Algorithm:** AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305.
*   **Key Exchange:** Use derived ephemeral key for symmetric encryption of communication data. No traditional key exchange protocol required.
*   **Authentication:** GCM provides authenticated encryption, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Transport Layer:** TLS 1.3 over secure channel (e.g., SSH, DTLS).

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Device:** Embedded system (e.g., smartphone, IoT device) with bio-signal sensors and processing capabilities.
*   **Server:** Remote server for optional data storage and management.
*   **Communication:** Secure channel between device and server.

**5. Security Considerations:**

*   **Sensor Spoofing:** Implement anti-spoofing measures (e.g., signal quality monitoring, anomaly detection).
*   **Side-Channel Attacks:** Protect KDF implementation against side-channel attacks (e.g., timing attacks, power analysis).
*   **Pre-Shared Secret Protection:** Securely store and manage pre-shared secret.
*   **Entropy Source:** Ensure sufficient entropy in bio-signal data.
*   **Noise Reduction:** Minimize the impact of noise and artifacts in bio-signal data.



This system provides continuous authentication and secure communication based on the userâ€™s physiological state, eliminating the need for static credentials or traditional key exchange protocols. It offers a highly secure and user-friendly authentication mechanism for a wide range of applications.
