## Adaptive Block Prefetching via Predictive Access Patterns

**Specification:** Implement a system for dynamically predicting file access patterns and prefetching blocks into the block pool *before* a request arrives, optimizing for latency.  This moves beyond simply reacting to allocation requests; it proactively prepares for them.

**Components:**

*   **Access Pattern Analyzer (APA):** A module that monitors file system operations (reads, writes, metadata updates).  It constructs a historical access pattern graph. This graph records sequences of block accesses â€“ not just which blocks, but the *order* in which they were accessed. The APA employs a sliding window approach.
*   **Pattern Prediction Engine (PPE):**  Utilizes the access pattern graph from the APA. The PPE uses machine learning (specifically, sequence prediction models like LSTMs or Transformers) to predict the *next* blocks likely to be accessed based on the current sequence of operations. It outputs a probability distribution over available blocks.
*   **Prefetch Manager (PM):**  Receives the probability distribution from the PPE. The PM dynamically adjusts the number of blocks prefetched based on the prediction confidence.  High confidence = prefetch more blocks; low confidence = prefetch fewer.  It maintains a "prefetched" list separate from the main block pool, and moves blocks from the prefetched list to the main pool only when a request for those blocks comes in.  If a prediction is incorrect (a prefetched block isn't used within a defined timeframe), it's evicted.
*   **Block Pool Extension:** The existing block pool is extended with a 'hot' and 'cold' section. 'Hot' blocks are predicted via the PPE. 'Cold' blocks exist in the storage system.

**Pseudocode (Prefetch Manager):**

```
function prefetch_blocks(probability_distribution):
  top_n = determine_n_to_prefetch(probability_distribution) // Dynamically adjust based on confidence
  blocks_to_prefetch = select_top_n_blocks(probability_distribution, top_n)

  for block in blocks_to_prefetch:
    if block not in prefetched_list and block not in block_pool:
      allocate_block_from_cold_storage(block) // Moves block from cold storage to prefetched list
      add_block_to_prefetched_list(block)
```

```
function handle_request(request):
  required_blocks = request.blocks

  for block in required_blocks:
    if block in prefetched_list:
      move_block_from_prefetched_to_block_pool(block)
    elif block in block_pool:
      // Block is already in the pool, proceed as normal
      pass
    else:
      // Block is not in either list, allocate from cold storage
      allocate_block_from_cold_storage(block)
      add_block_to_block_pool(block)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `AccessPatternGraph`: Graph representing sequences of block accesses. Nodes are blocks; edges represent the order of access.
*   `ProbabilityDistribution`:  Dictionary mapping block IDs to their predicted access probability.
*   `prefetched_list`:  List of block IDs currently prefetched.
*    `block_pool`: existing block pool

**Refinements:**

*   **Workload Differentiation:**  Train separate prediction models for different types of workloads (e.g., read-heavy, write-heavy, mixed).
*   **Metadata Prefetching:**  Extend the prediction model to include metadata access patterns.
*   **Cold Storage Tiering:**  Use a tiered cold storage system to optimize for cost and latency.
*    **Eviction Strategy:** Use an eviction strategy to drop blocks based on predicted usage. Least recently used, least frequently used, and frequency-based will be explored.
*   **Failure Management:** Implement resilience to block prediction failures and storage system outages.
