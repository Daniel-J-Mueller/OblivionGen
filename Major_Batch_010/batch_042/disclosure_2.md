## Dynamic Communication Space Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the voice command system to dynamically create and manage communication ‘spaces’ that aren’t limited to simple call joining. These spaces can blend different communication modalities (voice, video, text, shared screens) and intelligently route participants based on context, device capabilities, and pre-defined ‘space profiles’.

**Specifications:**

**1. Space Profiles:**

*   **Definition:** A configuration template defining the desired communication modalities, participant roles, and device requirements for a specific activity. Examples: “Brainstorm Session” (high bandwidth video, shared whiteboard), “Quick Check-in” (voice only, mobile preferred), “Remote Assistance” (screen share, AR overlay capability).
*   **Creation/Editing:** Users can create and edit space profiles via a dedicated application or voice command interface.  Space profiles are stored in a cloud-based profile library.
*   **Profile Attributes:**
    *   `name`: String (e.g., “Board Meeting”)
    *   `modality_priority`: Array (e.g., `["video", "voice", "text"]`) – indicates preferred communication methods.
    *   `device_requirements`:  Object (e.g., `{“min_camera_resolution”: “720p”, “required_bandwidth”: “5Mbps”}`)
    *   `role_definitions`: Array of Objects (e.g., `[{“role”: “Presenter”, “permissions”: [“screen_share”, “mute_all”]}, {“role”: “Attendee”, “permissions”: []}]`)
    *   `location_sensitivity`: Boolean (true/false - enables location-based routing)
    *    `time_sensitivity`: Boolean (true/false - enables time-based routing)

**2. Dynamic Space Creation & Routing:**

*   **Trigger:** Voice command (e.g., “Start Board Meeting,” “Connect to Support”) initiates space creation.
*   **Space ID Generation:**  Unique ID is generated for the session, along with a temporary access key.
*   **Participant Discovery:** System identifies potential participants based on:
    *   User's contact list
    *   Group memberships
    *   Contextual information (location, time, device type)
    *   Space profile requirements
*   **Device Compatibility Check:**  Verifies participants' devices meet the space profile’s minimum requirements.  If requirements aren’t met, the system can offer downgraded modalities or suggest alternative participants.
*   **Intelligent Routing:** Participants are routed to the appropriate communication channels based on:
    *   Device capabilities (video call to those with cameras, voice call to those without)
    *   Network bandwidth (prioritize video for high-bandwidth connections)
    *   Location (route participants to geographically closer servers for lower latency)
    *   Role definitions. (Presenter to screen share, attendees to view only)
*   **Modality Negotiation:**  System dynamically negotiates communication modalities based on participant capabilities and network conditions.
*   **Adaptive Bandwidth Management:**  Dynamically adjusts video/audio quality to maintain a stable connection.

**3. Pseudocode:**

```
function createCommunicationSpace(voiceCommand) {
  spaceProfile = lookupSpaceProfile(voiceCommand);
  if (spaceProfile == null) {
    //Use default profile if not found
    spaceProfile = getDefaultProfile();
  }
  spaceID = generateUniqueID();
  participants = findPotentialParticipants(spaceProfile);
  validParticipants = filterParticipantsByDeviceCapabilities(participants, spaceProfile);
  routeParticipantsToChannels(validParticipants, spaceProfile);
  startCommunicationSession(spaceID);
}

function routeParticipantsToChannels(participants, spaceProfile) {
  for (participant in participants) {
    if (participant.device.hasCamera() && spaceProfile.modality_priority.includes("video")) {
      connectToVideoChannel(participant);
    } else if (spaceProfile.modality_priority.includes("voice")) {
      connectToVoiceChannel(participant);
    } else {
      connectToTextChannel(participant);
    }
  }
}
```

**4. Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Cloud-based communication server infrastructure
*   Voice recognition engine
*   Device capability database
*   Adaptive bitrate streaming technology
*   Mobile and desktop client applications
*   Integration with existing contact lists and group messaging platforms.
