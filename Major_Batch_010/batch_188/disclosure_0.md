## Adaptive Content Mirroring & Shared Experience System

**Concept:** Leverage proximity detection not just to *pause* or *prioritize* content, but to intelligently *mirror* and *blend* shared experiences across multiple devices, creating dynamic, collaborative viewing scenarios.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Proximity Sensor Array:** Each device (TV, tablet, phone) equipped with a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, UWB (Ultra-Wideband) for precise location, and potentially a low-resolution wide-angle camera for gesture/person detection.
*   **Edge Processing Unit:** Integrated into each device to handle real-time proximity data processing and preliminary blending calculations.
*   **High-Bandwidth Wireless Communication:** Wi-Fi 6E or similar, ensuring low latency for content synchronization.
*   **Computational Display Capabilities:** Each display capable of at least partial, independent rendering.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Proximity Engine:**  Responsible for collecting and fusing data from the sensor array. Output:  a dynamic ‘proximity graph’ showing all devices and users within range, relative positions, and movement vectors. Pseudocode:

    ```
    function processSensorData() {
        bleData = readBLEBeacons();
        uwbData = readUWBData();
        cameraData = analyzeCameraFeed();

        proximityGraph = fuseData(bleData, uwbData, cameraData);  //Combines data, filters noise, resolves conflicts
        return proximityGraph;
    }
    ```

*   **Experience Director:**  Central logic that interprets the proximity graph and dictates how content is blended across devices.  Key parameters:
    *   **Sharing Mode:** (e.g., “Mirror,” “Extend,” “Collaborate,” “Personal”).
    *   **Blending Algorithm:** (see below).
    *   **User Profiles:**  Stores preferences for individual users (e.g., preferred content types, viewing settings).

*   **Rendering Engine:** Responsible for rendering content on each device, incorporating the blending algorithm.

**3. Blending Algorithms (Examples):**

*   **Dynamic Pan & Scan:** If a user is looking at a specific section of a large display (e.g., a map), their personal device's screen displays a zoomed-in, high-resolution view of that area, while the main display remains in a broader context view.
*   **Collaborative Annotation:** Users can annotate content on their personal devices, with annotations being instantly visible on other shared displays (e.g., highlighting points of interest on a map, drawing diagrams over a video).
*   **Perspective-Aware Blending:** If multiple users are viewing a 3D object, each device displays the object from the user’s individual perspective, creating a more immersive experience.
*   **Content Augmentation:**  One device could display base content, and another device could 'layer' additional information on top (e.g., a sports game with real-time statistics, a movie with behind-the-scenes footage).

**4. Operational Flow:**

1.  Devices continuously run the `processSensorData()` function.
2.  The Experience Director receives the proximity graph and applies the selected Sharing Mode and Blending Algorithm.
3.  The Experience Director sends rendering instructions to each device.
4.  Devices render content according to the instructions.
5.  The cycle repeats, dynamically adapting to changes in proximity and user interaction.

**5. Advanced Features:**

*   **AI-Powered Scene Understanding:**  Employing computer vision to analyze content and automatically suggest relevant blending algorithms.
*   **Gesture Recognition:** Enabling users to control the blending process through gestures.
*   **Personalized Content Delivery:**  Adapting content to individual user preferences and viewing habits.
*   **Secure Data Transmission:** Encrypting all data transmissions to protect user privacy.
