## Mobile Apparatus Item Interaction Prediction & Pre-Positioning

**Concept:** Extend the item identification system to *predict* what items a mobile apparatus operator will likely interact with *before* they do, and proactively stage those items for easier access. This moves beyond simple identification to anticipatory logistics.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Mobile apparatus location (from existing system).
    *   Operator ID (RFID, biometric, or login).
    *   Historical interaction data: Item interactions per operator, location, time of day, and task type (stored database).
    *   Real-time task assignment data (integration with work order system).
    *   Environmental data: Proximity to specific zones (e.g., assembly line, shipping dock) – leveraging facility map and sensors.
*   **Prediction Engine:**
    *   AI/ML model (Recurrent Neural Network preferred) trained on historical data.  Model outputs a probability distribution of likely items to be interacted with within a defined timeframe (e.g., next 5 minutes).
    *   Weighted factors: Operator skill level, task complexity, proximity to item storage, and time of day all contribute to prediction score.
    *   Dynamic adjustment: Prediction weights updated in real-time based on observed operator behavior.
*   **Pre-Positioning System:**
    *   Automated conveyance system (e.g., small robotic arms, conveyor belts, or AGVs) integrated with item storage locations.
    *   Based on predicted item probabilities, the system proactively moves high-probability items to a readily accessible location near the operator’s anticipated workspace.
    *   Prioritization: System prioritizes item movement based on prediction score and estimated retrieval time.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Heads-up display (HUD) or mobile app indicating predicted items and their pre-positioned locations.
    *   Operator override: Ability to manually request items or cancel pre-positioning.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   Modular design: Separate modules for data ingestion, prediction, and pre-positioning.
    *   API-driven integration:  Open APIs for integration with existing facility systems (WMS, MES, task management).
*   **Pseudocode (Prediction Engine):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION predict_next_items(operator_id, location, task_type, time_of_day):
    // Retrieve historical interaction data
    historical_data = DATABASE.query(
        "SELECT item_id, interaction_count FROM interactions "
        "WHERE operator_id = %s AND location = %s AND task_type = %s AND time_of_day = %s",
        (operator_id, location, task_type, time_of_day)
    )

    // Retrieve environmental factors (proximity to zones)
    environmental_factors = SENSOR.read(location)

    // Calculate prediction score for each item
    item_scores = {}
    FOR item IN all_items:
        score = 0
        IF item IN historical_data:
            score += historical_data[item] * WEIGHT_HISTORY
        score += environmental_factors[item_location] * WEIGHT_ENVIRONMENT
        // Add other factors (operator skill, task complexity)
        item_scores[item] = score

    // Sort items by score and return top N
    sorted_items = SORT(item_scores, descending=True)
    RETURN sorted_items[:N]
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased operator efficiency and reduced travel time.
*   Improved ergonomics and reduced strain.
*   Optimized item flow and reduced congestion.
*   Potential for automated task completion (integrated with robotic assistance).
