## Adaptive Propeller Morphing & Sonic Disruption

**Concept:** Enhance automated aerial vehicle (AAV) safety not by *stopping* the propeller, but by radically altering its physical properties and generating targeted sonic waves to deflect objects *before* contact, or to minimize impact force. This moves beyond reactive safety to proactive and mitigative safety.

**Specifications:**

**1. Morphing Propeller Design:**

*   **Material:** Propeller blades constructed from a multi-layered composite material – shape memory alloy (SMA) core encased in a flexible polymer matrix and covered with a durable, micro-textured outer layer.  The SMA allows for rapid, controlled changes in blade curvature and stiffness.
*   **Segmented Blade Structure:** Each blade divided into independently controllable segments (minimum 10 segments per blade). Each segment contains embedded micro-actuators (piezoelectric or miniature hydraulic) to execute precise shape changes.
*   **Aerodynamic Surface Control:** Micro-textured outer layer (biomimicry based on shark skin) allows for dynamic adjustment of airflow.  Actuators can alter the surface roughness to reduce drag or create localized vortices.
*   **Integrated Sensors:** Each segment equipped with:
    *   Strain gauges to measure stress and deformation.
    *   Micro-Doppler radar to detect approaching objects.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to track segment orientation and velocity.

**2. Sonic Deflection System:**

*   **Array of Ultrasonic Transducers:** Integrated into the propeller hub and strategically positioned along the leading edge of each blade.
*   **Beamforming Capabilities:** Transducers capable of generating focused ultrasonic beams with variable frequency and amplitude.
*   **Object Tracking & Prediction:** Real-time object tracking using onboard sensors (LiDAR, cameras) and predictive algorithms to estimate object trajectory.
*   **Sonic Wave Modulation:** Algorithm to modulate sonic wave frequency and amplitude to create a localized ‘sonic wall’ that deflects or slows down approaching objects. This sonic wall isn’t about sonic boom, but subtle pressure changes.
*   **Frequency Sweep:** System employs a frequency sweep to find resonant frequencies in the approaching object, maximizing deflection force.

**3. Control System & Software:**

*   **Hierarchical Control Architecture:**
    *   **Low-Level:** Segment-level control of blade shape and ultrasonic transducer activation.
    *   **Mid-Level:** Object detection, tracking, and trajectory prediction.
    *   **High-Level:** Safety profile selection and overall system coordination.
*   **Adaptive Safety Profiles:** Based on environmental conditions (altitude, area, object type), the system selects an appropriate safety profile.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:** The system learns from past encounters to improve its object detection and deflection capabilities.
*   **Emergency Protocol:** In critical situations (e.g., rapidly approaching high-mass object), the system prioritizes maximum deflection force, even if it means sacrificing aerodynamic efficiency.
*   **Pseudocode for Deflection Algorithm:**

```
// Input: Detected object (position, velocity, mass), Current AAV state (position, velocity)

function deflectObject(object, aavState) {

  // 1. Predict object impact point
  impactPoint = predictImpact(object, aavState);

  // 2. Calculate required deflection force
  deflectionForce = calculateDeflectionForce(object.mass, object.velocity);

  // 3. Activate sonic transducers
  for each transducer in transducerArray {
    transducer.frequency = optimizeFrequency(object);
    transducer.amplitude = calculateAmplitude(deflectionForce);
    transducer.direction = aimTowards(object);
    transducer.activate();
  }

  // 4. Morph propeller blade segments
  for each segment in bladeSegments {
    segment.curvature = calculateCurvature(impactPoint);
    segment.stiffness = calculateStiffness(impactPoint);
    segment.adjust();
  }

  // 5. Monitor impact and adjust strategy (feedback loop)
}
```

**4. Power & Cooling:**

*   High-density battery system integrated into the AAV frame.
*   Microfluidic cooling system to dissipate heat generated by the actuators and transducers.
*   Energy harvesting system (e.g., piezoelectric materials) to capture energy from blade vibrations.
