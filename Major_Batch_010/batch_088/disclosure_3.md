## Personalized Proactive Slot Elicitation with Multi-Modal Context

**Concept:** Expand beyond reactive slot clarification to *proactively* anticipate and elicit missing or ambiguous slot data based on user context *before* a full request is articulated. Leverage multi-modal data (text, audio prosody, device sensor data) to inform a probabilistic model predicting likely slot deficiencies.

**Specification:**

**1. Contextual Data Ingestion Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time stream of user input (text, audio), device sensor data (location, time of day, activity – e.g., driving, walking, stationary), recent interaction history, user profile data.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Standard intent & entity recognition on partial utterances.
    *   **Prosody Analysis:** Extract features from audio signal – pitch, tempo, energy – to indicate user hesitancy, uncertainty, or emphasis.
    *   **Sensor Fusion:** Correlate sensor data with NLU output.  Example: User saying "Book a flight" while driving triggers increased probability of needing destination, date, and passenger count.
    *   **History Tracking:** Maintain short-term memory of recently discussed topics, entities, and preferences.
*   **Output:** Context Vector – a numerical representation of the current user state.

**2. Slot Deficiency Prediction Model:**

*   **Architecture:** Probabilistic graphical model (Bayesian Network or similar).
*   **Training Data:** Large corpus of user interactions with labeled slot deficiencies.
*   **Input:** Context Vector.
*   **Output:** Probability distribution over potential missing or ambiguous slots.  (e.g., P(missing_destination) = 0.7, P(ambiguous_date) = 0.3).

**3. Proactive Slot Elicitation Engine:**

*   **Thresholding:** Define confidence thresholds for slot deficiency probabilities.
*   **Elicitation Strategy:**
    *   **Adaptive Questioning:** Generate natural language prompts based on predicted slot deficiencies.  Prioritize slots with highest probability and relevance to the current context.  (e.g., “Where would you like to fly?” if destination is highly probable).
    *   **Multi-Modal Prompting:** Choose prompt modality (voice, text, visual) based on device capabilities and user preferences.  Example: Display a map on a smart display for location-based queries.
    *   **Confirmation Bias Mitigation:**  Present multiple options for ambiguous slots to avoid leading the user. (e.g., “Are you thinking of this Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday?”).
*   **Output:** Generated prompt and chosen modality.

**4.  Dialog Management Integration:**

*   **Interrupt Handling:**  Allow proactive prompts to interrupt partial user utterances.
*   **Context Carryover:**  Maintain slot values elicited through proactive prompts in the dialog state.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  Continuously refine the slot deficiency prediction model based on user feedback and interaction success.

**Pseudocode:**

```
loop:
    user_input = receive_user_input()
    context_vector = ingest_contextual_data(user_input)
    slot_probabilities = predict_slot_deficiencies(context_vector)

    for slot, probability in slot_probabilities:
        if probability > threshold:
            prompt = generate_prompt(slot)
            modality = select_modality()
            output_prompt(prompt, modality)
            user_response = receive_user_response()
            update_dialog_state(user_response) # Include new slot value

    process_complete_request()
```

**Novelty:** This design shifts from *reactive* slot clarification to a *proactive* and context-aware approach. By anticipating slot deficiencies *before* the user fully articulates their request, it aims to create a more fluid and efficient conversational experience, potentially reducing turn count and improving user satisfaction. The multi-modal context integration is key to more accurate slot deficiency predictions.
