## Adaptive Key Rotation Based on Network Conditions

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust key rotation frequency and algorithm complexity based on real-time network health and security assessments. This goes beyond simple periodic rotation and introduces a responsive, adaptive security layer.

**Specifications:**

**1. Network Health Monitoring Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time network metrics (latency, packet loss, jitter, bandwidth), device health (CPU load, memory usage), and security event logs.
*   **Processing:** Applies weighted scoring algorithms to assess overall network health. Scoring considers:
    *   High Latency/Packet Loss: Increased risk of replay attacks.
    *   Device Strain: Potential for compromised key generation/storage.
    *   Security Events:  Evidence of active threats.
*   **Output:**  Network Health Score (0-100, 100 = optimal). Triggers alerts based on pre-defined thresholds.

**2. Adaptive Key Rotation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Network Health Score, Current Key Age, Key Complexity Level (see Section 3).
*   **Processing:**  Implements a decision tree logic to determine key rotation frequency and complexity.  Example logic:
    *   Score > 80: Rotate keys every 24 hours, maintain current complexity.
    *   Score 60-80: Rotate keys every 12 hours, increase complexity by one level (e.g., from AES-128 to AES-256).
    *   Score 40-60: Rotate keys every 6 hours, increase complexity to maximum, prioritize key distribution speed.
    *   Score < 40: Initiate emergency key rotation, leverage redundant key infrastructure, alert security operations.
*   **Output:** Key Rotation Request â€“ includes parameters for key generation, distribution, and activation.

**3. Key Complexity Levels:**

*   **Level 1 (Low):** Symmetric encryption (AES-128), simple key derivation function. Fast processing, suitable for high-bandwidth, trusted networks.
*   **Level 2 (Medium):** Symmetric encryption (AES-256), more robust key derivation function (e.g., PBKDF2). Balanced performance and security.
*   **Level 3 (High):** Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) with a longer key length, computationally expensive key derivation.  Highest security, suitable for untrusted networks and critical data.

**4. Key Distribution System:**

*   Employs a multi-channel distribution system for redundancy and resilience. Options include:
    *   Direct secure channel (TLS).
    *   Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
    *   Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for key storage and protection.
*   Prioritizes speed and reliability based on Network Health Score.

**5.  Secure Logging & Auditing:**

*   All key rotations, health score changes, and security events are logged with timestamps and detailed information.
*   Auditing tools allow administrators to review key rotation history and identify potential security vulnerabilities.



**Pseudocode (Adaptive Key Rotation Engine):**

```
function determineKeyRotation(networkHealthScore, currentKeyAge, keyComplexityLevel):
  if networkHealthScore > 80:
    rotationInterval = 24 hours
    newKeyComplexityLevel = keyComplexityLevel
  else if networkHealthScore >= 60 and networkHealthScore <= 80:
    rotationInterval = 12 hours
    newKeyComplexityLevel = min(keyComplexityLevel + 1, MAX_COMPLEXITY)
  else if networkHealthScore >= 40 and networkHealthScore < 60:
    rotationInterval = 6 hours
    newKeyComplexityLevel = MAX_COMPLEXITY
    prioritizeKeyDistributionSpeed = TRUE
  else:
    rotationInterval = immediate
    newKeyComplexityLevel = MAX_COMPLEXITY
    alertSecurityOperations()

  generateKey(newKeyComplexityLevel)
  distributeKey(prioritizeKeyDistributionSpeed)
  activateKey()
  logKeyRotation(timestamp, newKeyComplexityLevel)

  return rotationInterval
```
