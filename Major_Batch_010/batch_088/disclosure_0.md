## Seed Tree Orchestration with Dynamic Sub-Tree Delegation

**Concept:** Extend the seed tree generation and key derivation concept by introducing dynamic sub-tree delegation. Instead of a single authority managing the entire seed tree, allow for the creation of smaller, independently managed sub-trees, orchestrated by a coordinating entity. This increases scalability, resilience, and allows for fine-grained access control.

**Specs:**

**1. Coordinating Entity:**
   *   **Function:** Manages the overall seed tree structure, defines sub-tree boundaries, and assigns sub-tree ownership/management to delegated entities (Sub-Tree Managers).
   *   **Data Structures:**
        *   `GlobalSeed`: Initial master seed value.
        *   `SubTreeMap`:  A mapping of Sub-Tree IDs to Sub-Tree Managers (addresses/identifiers).
        *   `SubTreeDefinitions`: Defines the structure of each sub-tree (fanout, depth, seed derivation function).
   *   **API:**
        *   `RegisterSubTreeManager(ManagerID, SubTreeDefinition)`:  Registers a new Sub-Tree Manager and associates it with a specific sub-tree definition.
        *   `RequestSeed(SubTreeID)`: Returns a root seed value for a specific sub-tree, derived from the `GlobalSeed` and the sub-tree's definition.
        *   `VerifySubTreeRootHash(SubTreeID, RootHash)`: Verifies the root hash of a sub-tree against expected values.

**2. Sub-Tree Manager:**
   *   **Function:**  Responsible for generating, managing, and securing a specific sub-tree within the overall seed tree. Operates independently of other Sub-Tree Managers.
   *   **Data Structures:**
        *   `RootSeed`: Seed value received from the Coordinating Entity.
        *   `SubTreeDefinition`:  Definition of the sub-tree's structure (fanout, depth, seed derivation function).
        *   `KeySet`: Collection of one-time-use keys derived from the sub-tree.
        *   `HashTreeRoot`:  Root hash of the hash tree generated from the KeySet.
   *   **API:**
        *   `GenerateKeys()`: Creates the KeySet from the RootSeed according to the SubTreeDefinition.
        *   `GenerateHashTree()`: Creates the HashTree from the KeySet.
        *   `GetHashTreeRoot()`: Returns the HashTreeRoot for verification by the Coordinating Entity.

**3. Orchestration Process:**

   1.  **Initialization:** The Coordinating Entity generates the `GlobalSeed` and defines the overall seed tree structure, dividing it into sub-trees.
   2.  **Delegation:** The Coordinating Entity registers Sub-Tree Managers, assigning each one a specific sub-tree and its `SubTreeDefinition`.
   3.  **Seed Request:** Each Sub-Tree Manager requests a `RootSeed` for its sub-tree from the Coordinating Entity. The Coordinating Entity derives this seed from the `GlobalSeed` based on the sub-tree’s ID and definition.
   4.  **Key Generation & Hashing:** Each Sub-Tree Manager independently generates its KeySet and HashTree using its `RootSeed` and `SubTreeDefinition`.
   5.  **Verification:** Each Sub-Tree Manager provides its `HashTreeRoot` to the Coordinating Entity for verification.
   6.  **Master Hash Tree Construction:** The Coordinating Entity collects and integrates the verified `HashTreeRoots` from all Sub-Tree Managers into a comprehensive master hash tree. This master hash tree’s root becomes the public key for the entire system.

**Pseudocode (Coordinating Entity - RequestSeed):**

```
function RequestSeed(SubTreeID, SubTreeDefinition) {
  // Derive sub-tree specific seed from global seed using ID and definition
  SubTreeSeed = Hash(GlobalSeed + SubTreeID + SubTreeDefinition.fanout + SubTreeDefinition.depth)
  return SubTreeSeed
}
```

**Novelty:** This system decouples seed tree management, increasing scalability and reducing the single point of failure inherent in the original patent. It allows for distributed key generation and more granular access control over key material, providing a more resilient and flexible key management system. Sub-tree managers can be dynamically added or removed without impacting the entire system.
