## Aerial Vehicle Resonance Mapping with Directed Energy & Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Expand the vibration analysis beyond visual/optical methods to incorporate directed energy (specifically, focused ultrasound) for precise excitation *and* a haptic feedback system for a pilot/operator to ‘feel’ the resonance characteristics of the vehicle in real-time. This moves beyond purely diagnostic vibration analysis towards active vehicle control and enhanced situational awareness.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Excitation Array:** A phased array of miniature ultrasonic transducers integrated into the aerial vehicle's frame (potentially conformal to the surface).  Each transducer is individually addressable and capable of emitting focused ultrasound beams across a broad frequency range (1 Hz – 20 kHz, adjustable).
*   **Sensor Suite:** High-speed cameras (as per the source patent) coupled with an array of MEMS accelerometers distributed across critical structural components (wings, fuselage, motor mounts). Accelerometers provide ground truth data and calibration for optical measurements.
*   **Processing Unit:** A dedicated embedded system capable of real-time signal processing (FFT, beamforming, modal analysis). Must support dynamic frequency sweeps and pattern generation for the ultrasonic array.
*   **Haptic Interface:** A multi-axis force feedback system integrated into a control yoke or wearable device.  This system translates resonant frequencies and amplitudes into tactile sensations for the operator.  Different frequencies could be mapped to different vibration patterns or intensities.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Frequency Sweep Module:** Generates and controls frequency sweeps for the ultrasonic array, varying amplitude and direction of beams.
    *   **Modal Analysis Engine:** Processes accelerometer and camera data to identify natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping characteristics.
    *   **Haptic Mapping Algorithm:** Translates modal data into appropriate haptic feedback signals. This should include parameters for frequency, amplitude, and pattern.  Allows the operator to ‘feel’ the resonant behavior of the vehicle.
    *   **Adaptive Control Loop (Optional):** Integrate the resonant data into the vehicle's flight control system to actively dampen vibrations or exploit resonance for maneuverability (advanced application).

**Pseudocode (Haptic Mapping Algorithm):**

```
// Input: Modal Data (frequency, amplitude, mode shape)
// Output: Haptic Feedback Signals (force, frequency, pattern)

function mapModalDataToHaptics(frequency, amplitude, modeShape) {

  // Define Haptic Scaling Parameters
  maxForce = 10 N;        // Maximum allowable force
  baseFrequency = 50 Hz;  // Baseline haptic frequency

  // Calculate Haptic Frequency (modulated by resonant frequency)
  hapticFrequency = baseFrequency + (frequency / 10);  // Modulate base frequency

  // Calculate Haptic Amplitude (scaled by resonant amplitude)
  hapticAmplitude = amplitude * (maxForce / maxAmplitude); // Scale to max force

  // Generate Haptic Pattern based on Mode Shape (simplified example)
  if (modeShape == "wing_flex") {
    pattern = "lateral_vibration";
  } else if (modeShape == "fuselage_torsion") {
    pattern = "rotational_vibration";
  } else {
    pattern = "static_force"; // Default for unknown mode shapes
  }

  // Output Haptic Signals
  outputForce = hapticAmplitude;
  outputFrequency = hapticFrequency;
  outputPattern = pattern;

  return (outputForce, outputFrequency, outputPattern);
}
```

**Operational Scenario:**

1.  During pre-flight checks or in-flight, the system initiates a frequency sweep using the ultrasonic array.
2.  The cameras and accelerometers capture the vehicle’s response to the excitation.
3.  The modal analysis engine identifies resonant frequencies and mode shapes.
4.  The haptic mapping algorithm translates this data into tactile sensations, providing the operator with real-time feedback on the vehicle’s structural health and vibration characteristics.
5.  The operator can ‘feel’ changes in resonance due to load, damage, or environmental conditions, enabling proactive adjustments and informed decision-making.
