**Personalized Gift Campaign "Wishlist Echo" System**

**Concept:** Extend the gift campaign functionality by integrating a "Wishlist Echo" system. This allows recipients to passively contribute to their own gift options *without* directly stating preferences, fostering surprise while increasing gift satisfaction.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Wishlist Data Source:** System integrates with existing e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Etsy, etc.) to access public or shared wishlists. If no public wishlist exists, the system analyzes the recipient's publicly available social media activity (likes, shares, comments, posts) to create a "derived wishlist" representing inferred preferences.

2.  **Preference Weighting:** Algorithm assigns weights to items based on frequency of interaction, recency, and source (explicit wishlist vs. derived). Explicit wishlist items receive higher weight.

3.  **"Echo" Mode:** Campaign organizers can enable "Echo Mode". In this mode, suggested gifts aren’t *directly* from the wishlist but are algorithmically similar (based on attributes like category, price, brand, style) to items on it. The system intentionally obfuscates the direct link to the original wishlist item for the surprise factor.  A "similarity score" is calculated and presented to the gift-giver *only* for internal sorting/selection.

4.  **Dynamic Suggestion Pool:**  The system maintains a pool of suggested gifts, constantly updated based on real-time inventory, pricing, and user interactions.

5.  **"Surprise Factor" Slider:**  Organizers can adjust a “Surprise Factor” slider.  Higher settings increase the algorithmic deviation from the original wishlist items, favoring more unexpected suggestions.

6.  **"Reveal Hint" Option (Optional):**  For hesitant gift-givers, a limited "Reveal Hint" option provides a broad category or attribute of the suggested gift (e.g., “Something related to home decor”, “A book by a science fiction author”).  Usage is tracked to understand user desire for hints.

7.  **Gift-Giver Preference Input:** Allow gift-givers to input general preferences (e.g., “avoid clothing”, “must be eco-friendly”) which filter the suggestion pool.

**Pseudocode (Suggestion Generation):**

```
FUNCTION generate_suggestions(recipient_id, gift_giver_preferences, surprise_factor):

    // Fetch wishlist items and calculate weights
    wishlist_items = fetch_wishlist(recipient_id)
    weighted_items = calculate_weights(wishlist_items)

    // Filter based on gift-giver preferences
    filtered_items = apply_gift_giver_preferences(weighted_items, gift_giver_preferences)

    // Introduce algorithmic deviation based on surprise_factor
    IF surprise_factor > 0:
        similar_items = find_similar_items(filtered_items, surprise_factor) //Algorithmically find items with similar attributes
        combined_items = merge_lists(filtered_items, similar_items)
    ELSE:
        combined_items = filtered_items

    // Sort by weight and price (optional)
    sorted_suggestions = sort_suggestions(combined_suggestions)

    RETURN sorted_suggestions
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `WishlistItem`: `{item_id, name, price, url, weight, source (wishlist/derived)}`
*   `GiftGiverPreferences`: `{avoid_categories, must_have_attributes}`
*   `SuggestionPool`:  Sorted list of `WishlistItem` objects.
