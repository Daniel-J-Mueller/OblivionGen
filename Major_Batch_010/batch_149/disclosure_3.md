## Dynamic Key Rotation via Blockchain Consensus

**Specification:** A system to manage and rotate data encryption keys using a permissioned blockchain, introducing a layer of tamper-proof auditability and decentralized consensus for key lifecycle management.

**Core Concept:** Instead of a centralized Key Management Service (KMS) dictating key rotation, introduce a permissioned blockchain where designated 'validator' nodes (potentially the metadata services described in the patent) propose and confirm key rotations. This provides a transparent, auditable history of key changes and a decentralized mechanism to prevent rogue key updates.

**System Components:**

*   **Blockchain Network:** A permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda) accessible to validator nodes.
*   **Validator Nodes:** Designated metadata/key services responsible for proposing and confirming key rotations.
*   **Key Rotation Proposals:** Transactions on the blockchain detailing proposed key rotations (queue ID, new key, rotation time).
*   **Consensus Mechanism:** A Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm to ensure agreement on key rotations despite potential validator failures.
*   **Key Distribution Service:** Upon consensus, a service broadcasts the new key to front-end nodes.
*   **Front-End Node Integration:** Front-end nodes periodically query the blockchain for pending key rotations and update their key caches accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Front-End Node - Key Update Logic):**

```
function updateKeys() {
  // Query Blockchain for pending key rotations
  pendingRotations = blockchain.getPendingKeyRotations(queueId);

  for each rotation in pendingRotations {
    // Verify signature/authenticity of the rotation proposal
    if (verifySignature(rotation)) {
      // Update key cache with new key
      keyCache[queueId] = rotation.newKey;
      // Log key update event
      log("Key updated for queue " + queueId + " to " + rotation.newKey);
    } else {
      log("Invalid key rotation proposal for queue " + queueId);
    }
  }
}

// Run updateKeys() periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes)
setInterval(updateKeys, 300000); // 5 minutes in milliseconds
```

**Workflow:**

1.  A validator node (triggered by time or message volume) proposes a new key rotation for a specific queue via a blockchain transaction.
2.  Other validator nodes verify the proposal's validity (e.g., proposer authorization, key generation integrity).
3.  If a quorum of validator nodes approves the proposal, the transaction is committed to the blockchain.
4.  Front-end nodes periodically query the blockchain for pending rotations.
5.  Upon detecting a new rotation, front-end nodes update their key caches and begin encrypting/decrypting messages with the new key.

**Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Decentralized consensus makes it significantly harder for attackers to compromise key management.
*   **Tamper-Proof Auditability:** The blockchain provides an immutable record of all key rotations.
*   **Increased Transparency:** All key changes are visible to authorized participants.
*   **Resilience:** The system is more resilient to single points of failure.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Automated Key Generation:** Integrate with a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to generate keys within the blockchain network.
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Implement fine-grained access control to limit who can propose and approve key rotations.
*   **Smart Contract-Driven Rotation:** Define key rotation policies within smart contracts to automate the process.
