## Automated Tote Rotation & Inspection System â€“ EOAT Adaptation

**Concept:** Integrate a dynamic rotation and multi-angle inspection capability directly into the EOAT, allowing for comprehensive tote content verification *before* downstream processing. This moves inspection from a separate station to being concurrent with tote handling, dramatically increasing throughput and reducing bottlenecks.

**Specifications:**

*   **EOAT Base:** Existing EOAT frame serves as the mounting point.
*   **Rotation Module:**
    *   Integrated rotary actuator (electric servo motor preferred) mounted *above* the unloading arms.
    *   Rotation range: +/- 90 degrees (allowing full tote face access).
    *   Rotation speed: Adjustable, 0-30 degrees/second.
    *   Rotational Stability: Utilize a closed loop encoder for positional accuracy.
*   **Inspection System Integration:**
    *   Mount multiple (3-5) high-resolution cameras around the rotation module, angled downwards.
    *   Cameras: RGB, depth sensors for 3D mapping.
    *   Illumination: Integrated LED array for consistent, shadow-free lighting.
    *   Camera Control: Software-controlled camera triggering and image acquisition synchronized with tote rotation.
*   **Tote Gripping & Stabilization:**
    *   Supplemental pneumatic 'fingers' extend from the unloading arms to gently secure the tote during rotation. These fingers must retract fully before tote ejection.
    *   Pressure sensors on the fingers provide feedback on grip strength.
*   **Software Control:**
    *   Integration with existing robotic control system.
    *   Inspection Routine:
        1.  EOAT picks up tote stack.
        2.  EOAT positions stack over inspection zone.
        3.  Rotation Module activates.
        4.  Cameras capture images at pre-defined angles.
        5.  Image Processing: AI-powered algorithm analyzes images for:
            *   Object detection (verify correct items are present).
            *   Quantity verification (ensure the correct number of parts).
            *   Damage detection (identify any damaged or missing parts).
        6.  Based on inspection results:
            *   Pass: Continue with tote ejection sequence.
            *   Fail: Rotate tote to present the failure for manual review/removal, or divert to a reject station.
*   **Actuation:** Servo motors for precise control of rotation and finger extension/retraction. Pneumatic cylinders for rapid finger actuation.
*   **Power & Communication:** Standard industrial connectors for power and data communication. Ethernet interface for communication with the robot controller.
*   **Safety:** Emergency stop functionality integrated into the system. Safety interlocks to prevent operation if the system is not properly configured.

**Pseudocode (Inspection Routine):**

```
FUNCTION inspectToteStack(toteStack)
  // 1. Position tote over inspection zone
  positionTote(toteStack, inspectionZone)

  // 2. Initiate inspection sequence
  FOR angle IN [0, 90, 180, 270]  // Example angles
    rotateTote(angle)
    captureImages()
    processImages()
    IF (defectDetected()) THEN
      logDefect(defectType, defectLocation)
      RETURN FAIL
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  // 3. No defects found
  RETURN PASS
ENDFUNCTION
