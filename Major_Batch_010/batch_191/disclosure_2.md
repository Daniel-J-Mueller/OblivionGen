## Dynamic Recommendation 'Constellations'

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple category-based browsing to a visually-driven "constellation" of recommendations. Instead of listing categories with quantity identifiers, represent recommended items as nodes in a dynamic, interactive graph. The graph's structure and node size/color are determined by item similarity, user history, and real-time trending data.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Input:**
    *   Item Catalog: Standard item data (ID, name, description, images, price, etc.).
    *   User History: Purchase history, browsing behavior, ratings, wishlists.
    *   Real-time Data: Trending items, stock levels, promotional offers.
    *   Similarity Matrix: Pre-computed or dynamically generated based on item attributes and user behavior.

2.  **Graph Generation:**
    *   Nodes: Each recommended item represents a node in the graph.
    *   Edges: Edges connect similar items. Edge weight represents the degree of similarity.
    *   Node Size: Node size is proportional to the itemâ€™s popularity (based on sales, views, ratings, etc.).
    *   Node Color: Node color represents category or sub-category.
    *   Dynamic Layout: Force-directed graph layout algorithm to position nodes based on their connections. The algorithm adapts in real-time to changes in data.

3.  **User Interface:**
    *   Interactive Canvas: Users can pan, zoom, and click on nodes.
    *   Node Information: Clicking a node displays detailed item information.
    *   Filtering & Sorting: Options to filter items by category, price, rating, etc., and sort by relevance, popularity, price.
    *   Personalization: Graph layout and node highlighting are personalized based on user history.
    *   'Constellation' Exploration: Implement a "flow" mode where the system gently animates connections between related items, guiding the user's exploration.

4.  **Implementation Details:**
    *   Graph Database: Utilize a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to efficiently store and query the item graph.
    *   Frontend Framework: Use a modern frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) to build the interactive UI.
    *   Backend API: Develop a RESTful API to provide data to the frontend.
    *   Algorithm: Implement a hybrid recommendation algorithm that combines collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and knowledge-based filtering.
    *   Dynamic Re-Calculation: Trigger recalculation of graph layout and edge weights in response to user actions, real-time data updates, and trending items.

**Pseudocode (Graph Update):**

```
function updateGraph(userHistory, realTimeData, itemCatalog):
  // 1. Calculate item similarity based on item attributes and user history
  similarityMatrix = calculateSimilarity(itemCatalog, userHistory)

  // 2. Apply real-time data to boost/demote items
  for item in itemCatalog:
    if item in realTimeData:
      item.popularity += realTimeData[item].boost
    else:
      item.popularity -= 0.1  // Gradual decay for inactive items

  // 3. Build graph structure
  graph = new Graph()
  for item in itemCatalog:
    graph.addNode(item)

  for item1 in itemCatalog:
    for item2 in itemCatalog:
      if item1 != item2:
        similarityScore = similarityMatrix[item1][item2]
        if similarityScore > threshold:
          graph.addEdge(item1, item2, similarityScore)

  // 4. Apply force-directed layout algorithm
  layout = new ForceDirectedLayout(graph)
  layout.run(iterations=100)

  // 5. Return updated graph data for rendering
  return layout.getNodePositions()
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Augmented Reality Integration: Project the 'constellation' onto a physical space.
*   Voice Control: Allow users to navigate the 'constellation' using voice commands.
*   Social Sharing: Allow users to share their discovered 'constellations' with others.
