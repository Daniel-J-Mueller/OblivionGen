## Dynamic Simulation Load - Predictive Object Migration

**Concept:** Extend the existing dynamic load distribution to *predict* load imbalances *before* they occur, and proactively migrate object ownership based on predicted interactions, not just reactive thresholds. This moves beyond simply responding to overloaded nodes to anticipating and preventing overload.

**Specifications:**

**1. Interaction Graph Construction:**

*   **Data Source:** Utilize the simulation environment to track object interactions (proximity, collisions, targeting, communication, etc.).
*   **Graph Structure:** Build a directed graph where nodes represent objects, and edges represent interactions. Edge weights quantify the strength/frequency of interaction.
*   **Update Frequency:**  Graph updated every simulation tick or a configurable interval (adjustable for performance).
*   **Data Storage:** Graph stored in a distributed data structure accessible by all compute nodes. (e.g., a distributed hash table or graph database).

**2. Interaction Prediction Engine:**

*   **Algorithm:** Employ a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or a Hidden Markov Model) trained on historical interaction data.
*   **Prediction Horizon:** Predict object interactions for a specified time horizon (e.g., 5-10 simulation ticks).  This horizon is configurable.
*   **Output:**  Predicted interaction graph - a probabilistic representation of future interactions.
*   **Node-Local Prediction:** Each compute node predicts interactions for objects it *currently* owns. This distributes the prediction load.

**3. Load Prediction & Migration Trigger:**

*   **Compute Node Load Model:** Each compute node maintains a predictive load model. This model factors in:
    *   Current load.
    *   Predicted load based on the interaction prediction engine (interactions involving owned objects).
    *   Historical load patterns.
*   **Thresholding:** Define a *proactive* load threshold â€“ a level *below* the reactive threshold in the original patent.
*   **Migration Candidate Selection:** When the predicted load exceeds the proactive threshold, identify migration candidates:
    *   Objects with the highest contribution to the predicted load.
    *   Objects involved in interactions with objects on overloaded/likely-to-be-overloaded nodes.
*   **Migration Cost Function:** Evaluate the 'cost' of migrating each candidate object, considering:
    *   Communication overhead.
    *   Potential disruption to interactions.
    *   The impact on load balance.

**4. Dynamic Migration & Ownership Transfer:**

*   **Migration Algorithm:** Employ a greedy algorithm to select objects for migration, maximizing load reduction while minimizing migration cost.
*   **Ownership Transfer:** Seamlessly transfer ownership of selected objects to underutilized compute nodes.
*   **State Synchronization:**  Ensure state consistency during ownership transfer (e.g., using message passing or shared memory).

**Pseudocode (Migration Algorithm - Simplified):**

```
function migrate_objects(current_node, overloaded_objects, available_nodes):
  migration_candidates = []
  for obj in overloaded_objects:
    cost = calculate_migration_cost(obj)
    migration_candidates.append((obj, cost))

  migration_candidates.sort(key=lambda x: x[1]) // Sort by cost

  migrated_count = 0
  for (obj, cost) in migration_candidates:
    target_node = find_best_target_node(obj, available_nodes)
    if target_node:
      transfer_ownership(obj, current_node, target_node)
      migrated_count += 1
      if migrated_count >= max_migrations:
        break

  return
```

**5. Adaptability & Learning:**

*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Use reinforcement learning to optimize the proactive threshold, migration cost function, and migration algorithm. The reward function could be based on overall simulation performance (e.g., framerate, latency).
*   **Historical Data Analysis:** Continuously analyze historical simulation data to identify patterns and improve the accuracy of the prediction engine and migration strategy.
