## Adaptive Log Stream Weighting for Resource Prioritization

**Concept:** Extend the probabilistic data structure approach to incorporate dynamic weighting of log streams based on real-time resource impact analysis. This allows the system to prioritize processing of log streams originating from resources exhibiting critical performance issues, even if they aren’t the earliest or most numerous.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Resource Impact Monitor (RIM):**
    *   Continuously monitors key performance indicators (KPIs) – CPU utilization, memory consumption, disk I/O, network latency – for each computing resource.
    *   Calculates an “Impact Score” for each resource based on deviations from baseline KPIs and pre-defined thresholds.  This score represents the resource's current contribution to system-wide strain.
    *   RIM publishes Impact Scores via a real-time messaging system (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).

2.  **Weighted Bloom Filter (WBF):**
    *   Augment the standard Bloom filter with per-log-stream weights.  Instead of a single bit per log stream, store a weighted bit vector.
    *   Weight initialization: Based on the initial Impact Score of the originating resource. Higher initial Impact Score = Higher weight.
    *   Weight adjustment: Weights are dynamically updated based on real-time Impact Scores received from the RIM.  
        *   If Impact Score increases significantly, weight increases.
        *   If Impact Score decreases, weight decreases.
        *   Weight changes are capped to prevent runaway values.
    *   Hash Function Modification: The hashing function used for Bloom filter insertion/lookup incorporates the log stream's weight. Higher weight = More hash function iterations. This increases the probability of a hit for heavily weighted streams.

3.  **Adaptive Processing Queue (APQ):**
    *   Log streams are enqueued for processing based on a weighted priority scheme.
    *   Priority Calculation: `Priority = WBF Hit Probability + (Weight * Scaling Factor)`.
    *   The `Scaling Factor` controls the influence of the weight on the overall priority.
    *   APQ dynamically adjusts processing order to favor high-priority streams.

4.  **Continuation Token Extension:**
    *   The continuation token now includes:
        *   Current weights for each partially processed log stream.
        *   RIM timestamp (to correlate with RIM data).
        *   Scaling Factor used in the APQ.
    *   This allows resuming processing with the same prioritization logic.

**Pseudocode (APQ – simplified):**

```
function enqueue_log_stream(log_stream):
  impact_score = RIM.get_impact_score(log_stream.resource_id)
  weight = WBF.get_weight(log_stream)
  priority = WBF.hit_probability(log_stream) + (weight * scaling_factor)
  queue.insert(log_stream, priority)

function process_next_stream():
  if queue.is_empty():
    return
  stream = queue.pop_highest_priority()
  process_log_data(stream)
  update_wbf(stream) //update the Bloom Filter and weight
  update_rim_data(stream) //update RIM data associated with the resource
  enqueue_new_streams() //check for new streams to add to the queue
```

**Deployment Considerations:**

*   RIM should be a separate, scalable service.
*   WBF implementation requires careful optimization to balance accuracy and performance.
*   Scaling factor requires tuning based on the specific application and resource characteristics.
*   Monitor WBF false positive rate and adjust parameters as needed.
