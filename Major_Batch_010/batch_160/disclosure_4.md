## Automated Canary Analysis via Production Shadowing

**Concept:** Extend the test stack creation to incorporate a "shadowing" mechanism, mirroring live production traffic onto the newly created test stack for real-time canary analysis. This goes beyond simple code replication; it dynamically injects anonymized production requests into the test environment, allowing for observation of behavior under realistic load *before* deployment.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Shadow Traffic Injector (STI)
*   **Location:** Sits between the public-facing load balancer and the production services.
*   **Function:** Intercepts a configurable percentage of incoming production requests.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Request Capture:** STI captures the request (headers, body – anonymized where necessary –  method, URL).
    2.  **Request Replication:** STI duplicates the captured request.
    3.  **Destination Routing:**
        *   Original request proceeds to the live production service.
        *   Replicated request is routed to the corresponding service within the user-created test stack (VPC).  A mapping table correlates production service instances to their replicated counterparts within the VPC.
    4.  **Response Handling:** Responses from the test stack are logged for comparison against production responses.
    5.  **Anonymization:** Implement robust anonymization of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) before sending requests to the test stack. This must be configurable based on request type.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   `shadowing_percentage`:  Percentage of traffic to shadow (0-100).
    *   `anonymization_rules`:  A set of rules defining how to anonymize specific request fields.
    *   `service_mapping`:  A table mapping production service names/identifiers to corresponding service instances within the test stack.
    *   `test_stack_identifier`: Identifier for the active test stack to send shadowed traffic.
*   **Integration Points:**
    *   Load Balancer: Intercept traffic before it reaches production services.
    *   Service Discovery: Obtain a list of available production services and their corresponding instances.
    *   VPC Management: Dynamically route traffic to the correct instances within the test stack.
    *   Logging & Monitoring: Capture and analyze responses from both production and the test stack to identify discrepancies.

**Pseudocode (STI):**

```
function process_request(request):
    if random() < shadowing_percentage:
        shadow_request = clone(request)
        anonymize(shadow_request, anonymization_rules)
        destination = service_mapping[request.service_name]  //Retrieve test stack instance
        send_request(shadow_request, destination)
        log_request_details(request, shadow_request)
    forward_request(request) //Original request continues to production
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `anonymization_rules`:  A dictionary mapping field names to anonymization functions (e.g., `{"user_id": hash_function, "email": replace_with_dummy}`).
*   `service_mapping`:  A dictionary mapping production service names to VPC instance addresses (e.g., `{"auth_service": "10.0.0.10", "payment_service": "10.0.0.11"}`).

**Novelty:**  While test stack creation is useful, this extends it by enabling *dynamic* validation with real-world data *before* deployment. It moves beyond static testing to a more proactive and realistic validation process.  It’s not merely replicating code, but replicating *load* and *behavior*.
