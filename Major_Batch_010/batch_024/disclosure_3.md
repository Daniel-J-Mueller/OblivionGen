**Adaptive Audio Beaconing & Spatial Localization**

**Concept:** Expand upon the communication awareness within the patent to create a dynamic, localized audio experience. Instead of *just* prioritizing master devices based on connection status, use the communication network itself as a beaconing system for spatially aware audio.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Each audio device (the ‘nodes’) requires an additional low-power, directional microphone array (minimum 4 elements) and a miniature inertial measurement unit (IMU – accelerometer/gyroscope). Existing Bluetooth/Wi-Fi radio is utilized for communication.
*   **Software – Node Level:**
    *   **Beacon Emission:** Each node periodically emits a short, unique audio ‘ping’ (sub-audible or masked within content) alongside its network status. The ping’s amplitude is adjusted based on the node’s current communication load – heavier load = quieter ping.
    *   **IMU Data:** IMU data is processed to determine node orientation and movement. This data is packaged with the ping and transmitted.
    *   **Local Audio Processing:** Each node performs basic triangulation based on received pings from other nodes. This provides an estimated 3D position of each nearby node.
*   **Software – Central Controller (can be a designated ‘Master’ node or external device):**
    *   **Network Map Creation:** The Controller receives ping data from all nodes, creating a dynamic real-time map of the audio network’s physical layout.
    *   **Spatial Audio Engine:**
        *   Utilizes the node positions to implement spatial audio processing. Audio streams can be ‘placed’ in 3D space and rendered based on listener position (determined via a connected device – smartphone, VR headset, etc.).
        *   Audio ‘focus’ – the system can prioritize audio streams from nodes closer to the listener, dynamically adjusting volume and equalization.
    *   **Adaptive Beamforming:** The controller can instruct nodes to adjust their audio transmission directionality (beamforming) based on listener position, maximizing signal-to-noise ratio.
    *   **Automated Network Calibration:** The system automatically calibrates the network map by analyzing ping arrival times and signal strengths.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   Data packets include: Node ID, Ping Timestamp, Signal Strength, IMU Data (orientation), Communication Load (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi bandwidth usage).
    *   Packets are transmitted via a modified Bluetooth mesh network protocol.
*   **Pseudocode (Controller – Audio Routing):**

```
function routeAudio(listenerPosition, audioStream):
  nodePositions = getNetworkMap() // Returns list of (nodeID, [x, y, z])
  closestNode = findClosestNode(listenerPosition, nodePositions)
  
  if (closestNode != null):
    if (closestNode.communicationLoad < threshold):
      sendAudioToNode(audioStream, closestNode.nodeID)
      
      //Instruct nodes to route audio towards listener using spatial audio rendering
      instructNodes(listenerPosition, closestNode.nodeID)
    else:
      //Find next best node
      nextBestNode = findNextBestNode(closestNode, nodePositions)
      sendAudioToNode(audioStream, nextBestNode.nodeID)
      instructNodes(listenerPosition, nextBestNode.nodeID)
  else:
    //Broadcast to all nodes (fallback)
    broadcastAudio(audioStream)
```

**Novelty:** This expands the existing connection awareness from the patent beyond simple master/slave selection. It transforms the audio network *itself* into a sensor, enabling dynamic spatial audio experiences, automated network calibration, and intelligent audio routing. The use of the communication network as a positioning system is a key innovation. It adds a layer of spatial awareness not present in the original patent.
