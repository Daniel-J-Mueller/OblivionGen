## Dynamic Sensitivity Profiles & Federated Bias Mitigation

**Concept:** Extend bias mitigation beyond single, pre-defined sensitive attributes by creating *dynamic sensitivity profiles* for individual users, and implementing a federated learning approach to refine these profiles and bias mitigation transformations across a user base *without* centralizing sensitive data.

**Motivation:** The patent focuses on suppressing bias related to known sensitive attributes. However, bias isn't always obvious or directly linked to traditional demographics. Individual users may have *personal* sensitivities (e.g., aversion to certain visual styles, negative associations with specific objects) that impact search relevance. Moreover, rigid, globally applied bias mitigation can unintentionally *introduce* bias or reduce overall search quality.

**System Specs:**

1.  **User Sensitivity Profiler:**
    *   **Input:** User interaction data (clicks, dwell time, explicit feedback – thumbs up/down, saved items, shared items) with search results.
    *   **Process:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) analyzes user interaction sequences to identify patterns indicative of sensitivity.  The RNN outputs a sensitivity vector, representing the user's sensitivity across a latent space of potential biases.  This space isn’t pre-defined by specific attributes; it emerges from the data.  Sensitivity is *not* directly mapped to demographic attributes; it’s a higher-level representation of preference/avoidance.
    *   **Output:** A user-specific sensitivity vector, updated continuously as the user interacts with the system.

2.  **Federated Bias Mitigation Network:**
    *   **Architecture:** A distributed network of edge devices (user's phones, tablets, smart speakers). Each device hosts a local instance of a bias mitigation transformation matrix.
    *   **Training:**
        *   Each device calculates a local gradient of the transformation matrix based on its user's sensitivity vector and interaction data.
        *   These local gradients are aggregated (e.g., using Federated Averaging) on a central server *without* transmitting individual user data. The server only receives model updates.
        *   The aggregated update is applied to a global model, which is then redistributed to all edge devices.
    *   **Transformation Application:**
        *   When a user submits a query, the edge device applies the user's personalized transformation matrix *before* generating the query embedding.
        *   The transformation matrix suppresses dimensions of the query embedding that are strongly correlated with the user’s sensitivities.

3.  **Query Embedding Enhancement:**
    *   **Multi-modal Input Handling:** The system integrates visual, textual and audio embeddings.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** Incorporates user location, time of day, and recent search history as additional inputs to the query embedding process.
    *   **Dynamic Weighting:** Employs an attention mechanism to dynamically weight different dimensions of the query embedding based on the user’s sensitivity profile.

**Pseudocode (Federated Averaging):**

```python
# On each edge device:
def calculate_local_gradient(sensitivity_vector, query_embedding):
    # Calculate the gradient of the transformation matrix
    # that minimizes the correlation between the query embedding
    # and the user's sensitivity vector.
    return gradient

# On the central server:
def federated_averaging(local_gradients):
    # Aggregate local gradients from all edge devices.
    aggregated_gradient = sum(local_gradients) / len(local_gradients)
    return aggregated_gradient

# On each edge device:
def update_transformation_matrix(transformation_matrix, aggregated_gradient):
    # Apply the aggregated gradient to update the local transformation matrix.
    transformation_matrix = transformation_matrix - learning_rate * aggregated_gradient
    return transformation_matrix
```

**Novelty:** This approach goes beyond predefined biases. It learns individualized sensitivities, applies mitigation *before* embedding generation, and leverages federated learning to preserve user privacy. The system doesn't *assume* bias exists; it *discovers* it through user interaction. This provides a more nuanced and adaptive bias mitigation strategy.
