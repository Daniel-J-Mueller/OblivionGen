## Dynamic Item Highlighting & Haptic Feedback System

**Concept:** Augment the inventory holder with localized haptic feedback and dynamic illumination to guide user selection *before* physical interaction, driven by predicted item probability and user gaze tracking.

**Specifications:**

**1. Inventory Holder Hardware Modifications:**

*   **Micro-LED Array:** Each inventory slot within the holder is lined with a dense array of micro-LEDs capable of displaying a range of colors and intensities. Resolution: >60 PPI.
*   **Haptic Actuators:** Each inventory slot contains a miniature array of voice coil actuators (similar to those used in high-end smartphone vibration) providing localized tactile feedback. Force output: 0-500mN. Frequency response: 20Hz – 2kHz.
*   **Proximity/Capacitive Sensors:** Each slot features capacitive sensors to detect user hand proximity *before* physical touch. Range: 5-15cm.
*   **Embedded Processing:** A low-power ARM Cortex-M7 processor manages the LED array, haptic feedback, and sensor data within the holder. Communication: Wi-Fi 6/Bluetooth 5.2.

**2. System Integration:**

*   **User Gaze Tracking:** Integrate a lightweight, low-latency eye-tracking system (integrated into a headset or glasses worn by the user). Accuracy: <1° visual angle. Sample Rate: 60Hz.
*   **Central Control System:** The main facility computer maintains user profiles, predicted item lists, and probability scores.
*   **Real-time Communication:** Low-latency (<50ms) communication between the central system, eye-tracker, and inventory holder processor.

**3. Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Initialization
FOR each item IN predicted_items_list:
  get item_probability(item)
  set item_illumination_level = item_probability * max_illumination
  set item_haptic_intensity = item_probability * max_haptic_intensity

// User Approaches
ON user_detected_at_retrieval_area:
  start gaze_tracking()

// Real-time Loop
WHILE gaze_tracking_active():
  get current_gaze_position()

  FOR each item IN predicted_items_list:
    IF item_is_within_gaze_radius(item, gaze_position):
      // Intensify illumination & haptic feedback
      set item_illumination_level = max_illumination
      set item_haptic_intensity = max_haptic_intensity
    ELSE:
      set item_illumination_level = item_probability * max_illumination
      set item_haptic_intensity = item_probability * max_haptic_intensity
  
  ON hand_proximity_detected(item):
    trigger subtle haptic 'pulse' to confirm item focus.

  ON item_selected(item):
    update user_item_list(item)
    reset haptic/illumination for selected item.
```

**4. Calibration & Customization:**

*   User-specific sensitivity profiles for haptic feedback.
*   Ambient light adjustment for optimal illumination levels.
*   Configurable 'pulse' patterns for hand proximity detection.

**5. Power Requirements:**

*   Inventory holder: Powered via wireless charging or low-voltage DC connection.
*   Eye-tracker: Lightweight, battery-powered with >4 hour runtime.



This system aims to proactively guide user attention towards the most likely desired items, reducing search time and improving fulfillment efficiency through a combination of visual and tactile cues. It moves beyond simple item highlighting to create a more intuitive and engaging user experience.
