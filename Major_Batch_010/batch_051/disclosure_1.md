## Dynamic Projection Surface Reconstruction via Volumetric Capture & Neural Radiance Fields

**Concept:** Augment the existing color correction system with a real-time, volumetric reconstruction of the projection surface. This allows for not just color correction, but geometric correction, handling surfaces that aren't simply flat or have complex topology. We will move beyond the 2D color sampling towards a full 3D understanding.

**System Specs:**

*   **Volumetric Capture Array:** A dense array of Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras and RGB cameras positioned around the expected projection area.  The ToF cameras capture depth information, while the RGB cameras provide texture. Minimum density: 1 camera unit per 0.5m<sup>2</sup> of projection area.
*   **Processing Unit:** A high-performance GPU cluster responsible for:
    *   **Depth Map Fusion:**  Combining depth data from multiple ToF cameras into a cohesive point cloud.  Employ a robust filtering algorithm (e.g. Statistical Outlier Removal) to minimize noise and inaccuracies.
    *   **Mesh Generation:**  Creating a triangular mesh from the point cloud.  Algorithms: Poisson Surface Reconstruction, Ball Pivoting Algorithm.  Dynamic retopology to maintain mesh quality as the surface changes.
    *   **Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) Training:**  Training a NeRF on the generated mesh and texture data. The NeRF will learn a continuous volumetric representation of the projection surface. This is the core of the system.
    *   **Rendering Engine Integration:**  A custom rendering engine integrated with the projector.  This engine will render the source image *onto* the NeRF representation of the projection surface before sending it to the projector.
*   **Projector Control System:** The projector must support pixel-level brightness and color adjustment.
*   **Calibration System:** Automated calibration procedure to align the cameras, projector, and coordinate systems.

**Software Components:**

*   **Data Acquisition Module:** Handles camera control, data streaming, and synchronization.
*   **Point Cloud Processing Library:**  Implements filtering, registration, and surface reconstruction algorithms.
*   **NeRF Training Framework:** Based on existing NeRF implementations (e.g., TinyNeRF, Instant-NGP), optimized for real-time performance.
*   **Rendering Engine:**  Custom ray tracing engine that can sample the NeRF and calculate the appropriate color and brightness for each pixel of the projected image.  Uses a view-dependent lighting model to account for the surface irregularities.
*   **Dynamic Surface Update Algorithm:** An algorithm for incrementally updating the NeRF as the projection surface changes. This could involve techniques like online learning or Kalman filtering.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Surface Update):**

```
// Initialize NeRF with initial mesh/texture
NeRF = InitializeNeRF(InitialMesh, InitialTexture)

Loop:
    // Capture camera data
    CameraData = CaptureCameraData()

    // Process camera data to generate updated point cloud
    UpdatedPointCloud = ProcessCameraData(CameraData)

    // Calculate displacement between current and updated point cloud
    DisplacementVector = CalculateDisplacement(CurrentPointCloud, UpdatedPointCloud)

    // Update NeRF based on displacement vector (Incremental learning / Kalman Filter)
    NeRF = UpdateNeRF(NeRF, DisplacementVector, LearningRate)

    // Render source image onto updated NeRF
    RenderedImage = Render(SourceImage, NeRF)

    // Project RenderedImage onto projection surface
    Project(RenderedImage)

    // Update CurrentPointCloud with UpdatedPointCloud
    CurrentPointCloud = UpdatedPointCloud
```

**Novelty:**

This system doesn't just correct for color variations; it *virtually reconstructs* the projection surface in 3D, enabling the projection of images onto highly irregular or dynamic surfaces.  Existing color correction systems are 2D; this is fully 3D and dynamic. The combination of NeRFs with a real-time capture system is novel and allows for unprecedented geometric and color correction accuracy.
