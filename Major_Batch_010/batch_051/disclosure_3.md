## Predictive Certificate Health & Dynamic Asset Serving

**Concept:** Expand the 'latency introduction' concept to proactively serve different asset versions based on predicted certificate health, moving beyond simple warnings. Instead of *just* indicating expiration, anticipate it and dynamically adjust the experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Health Engine:**

*   **Input:** Continuous monitoring of certificate chain validity (not just expiration date), OCSP/CRL responsiveness, and historical renewal patterns. Leverage machine learning to predict potential renewal failures *before* expiration. Consider factors like DNS propagation times for new certificates.
*   **Output:** A ‘Health Score’ (0-100) reflecting certificate reliability. This score is constantly updated.

**2. Asset Versioning System:**

*   Maintain multiple versions of key website assets (images, Javascript, CSS).  Each version is tagged with a ‘Compatibility Level’ linked to the Health Score.
*   **Compatibility Levels:**
    *   **Level 1 (Health Score 90-100):** Standard, fully optimized assets.
    *   **Level 2 (Health Score 70-89):** Slightly reduced fidelity assets (e.g., compressed images, minimized JS).  Focus on maintaining core functionality.
    *   **Level 3 (Health Score 50-69):**  Basic, functional assets.  Prioritize text content and essential navigation.  Disable non-essential features.
    *   **Level 4 (Health Score <50):**  Emergency fallback.  Static HTML page with critical information and instructions.

**3. Dynamic Asset Serving Mechanism:**

*   Server-side logic intercepts asset requests.
*   Based on the current Health Score, the server selects the appropriate asset version to serve.
*   A client-side ‘Health Indicator’ displays a visual cue reflecting the certificate health (e.g., a color-coded icon).

**4.  Latency Injection Refinement:**

*   Instead of *just* adding latency, *vary* the latency based on the Health Score.  Higher Health Score = minimal latency. Lower Health Score = increasing latency, up to a configurable maximum.
*   The latency is injected at the TLS handshake level to simulate potential connection issues.

**5.  Pseudocode (Server-Side Asset Handler):**

```
function handleAssetRequest(request, assetPath) {
  healthScore = getCertificateHealthScore()

  if (healthScore >= 90) {
    assetUrl = assetPath // Serve standard asset
    latency = 0
  } else if (healthScore >= 70) {
    assetUrl = assetPath + "_v2" // Serve version 2
    latency = 50ms
  } else if (healthScore >= 50) {
    assetUrl = assetPath + "_v3" // Serve version 3
    latency = 200ms
  } else {
    assetUrl = "/emergency_assets/critical.html" // Serve fallback
    latency = 500ms
  }

  // Inject latency (e.g., using a sleep function or a dedicated latency queue)
  applyLatency(latency)

  // Serve asset from assetUrl
  serveAsset(assetUrl)
}
```

**6.  Client-Side Health Indicator:**

*   Javascript code periodically polls the server for the Health Score.
*   Updates a visual indicator (e.g., a color-coded icon) to reflect the current health.
*   Can display a warning message to the user if the Health Score is low.
