## Adaptive Resource Allocation based on Predictive Load

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting virtual machine (VM) resource allocation *before* peak load, leveraging predictive analytics based on proxy API call patterns.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on executing code on VMs *in response* to API calls. This expands on that by predicting future load and proactively allocating resources *before* the requests arrive, smoothing performance and reducing latency.

**Components:**

1.  **API Call Historian:**  Records all incoming proxy API calls, including timestamps, request parameters, response times, and originating client.  Data is stored in a time-series database optimized for rapid querying.
2.  **Predictive Analytics Engine:**  A machine learning model trained on the historical API call data.  This model predicts future API call volume and resource requirements (CPU, memory, I/O) for each proxy API endpoint.  Models include time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet) and potentially more complex models based on request parameters and historical correlations.  The engine outputs a ‘resource demand forecast’ for a rolling time window (e.g., next 5 minutes, next hour).
3.  **Resource Allocation Manager:** Monitors the resource demand forecast and compares it to the currently allocated resources for each VM.  If the forecast indicates an impending resource shortage, the manager proactively adjusts VM resource allocation.  This could involve:
    *   **Vertical Scaling:** Increasing the CPU/memory allocated to existing VMs.
    *   **Horizontal Scaling:** Launching new VM instances.
    *   **Pre-emptive Migration:**  Moving workloads to VMs with available capacity *before* they become overloaded.
4.  **Feedback Loop:**  Monitors actual VM resource usage and compares it to the predicted usage. This data is fed back into the Predictive Analytics Engine to improve the accuracy of future forecasts.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Manager):**

```
FUNCTION adjustResources(resourceDemandForecast, currentResourceAllocation):
    FOR EACH apiEndpoint IN resourceDemandForecast:
        predictedLoad = resourceDemandForecast[apiEndpoint].load
        predictedCPU = resourceDemandForecast[apiEndpoint].cpu
        predictedMemory = resourceDemandForecast[apiEndpoint].memory

        currentCPU = currentResourceAllocation[apiEndpoint].cpu
        currentMemory = currentResourceAllocation[apiEndpoint].memory

        IF predictedCPU > currentCPU:
            scaleCPU(apiEndpoint, predictedCPU)  // Increase VM CPU
        IF predictedMemory > currentMemory:
            scaleMemory(apiEndpoint, predictedMemory) //Increase VM Memory

        IF predictedLoad > threshold AND numVMs[apiEndpoint] < maxVMs[apiEndpoint]:
            launchVM(apiEndpoint)

        IF predictedLoad < lowThreshold AND numVMs[apiEndpoint] > minVMs[apiEndpoint]:
            terminateVM(apiEndpoint)

    END FOR
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**  Most current systems react to load; this system *anticipates* it. This proactive approach has the potential to significantly improve application performance and user experience, especially for applications with predictable usage patterns.
