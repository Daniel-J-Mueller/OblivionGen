## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Generation for UI Elements

**Specification:** A system to generate dynamic haptic feedback profiles for UI elements, directly correlated to visual element size and intended viewing distance, and further modulated by user interaction speed.

**Core Concept:** Extend the core principle of density-independent pixel determination to the haptic domain. Currently, the patent focuses on scaling visual elements based on viewing distance. This specification proposes extending that scaling to haptic feedback intensity and texture.

**System Components:**

1.  **Haptic Profile Database:** A pre-populated database containing a range of haptic textures and intensities. Each entry is tagged with a "visual size scale factor" and an "intended viewing distance" metadata.
2.  **Interaction Velocity Monitor:** A module to track the speed of user interactions (e.g., swipe velocity, tap duration).
3.  **Haptic Mapping Engine:** The core logic that selects and modulates haptic feedback.

**Operation:**

1.  Upon a UI element interaction, the system determines the visual size scale factor (as established by the patent's density-independent pixel logic) and intended viewing distance.
2.  The Haptic Mapping Engine queries the Haptic Profile Database using these parameters to identify suitable haptic profiles.
3.  The Interaction Velocity Monitor provides data on the speed of the userâ€™s interaction.
4.  The Haptic Mapping Engine modulates the selected haptic profile based on interaction velocity:
    *   *Slow Interaction:*  Subtle, prolonged haptic feedback.  Emphasis on texture.
    *   *Medium Interaction:* Standard haptic pulse with a defined duration.
    *   *Fast Interaction:* Sharp, brief haptic pulse with increased intensity.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateHapticFeedback(element, interactionVelocity):
  visualScale = getVisualScale(element) // From existing patent logic
  viewingDistance = getViewingDistance(element)

  hapticProfile = queryHapticProfileDatabase(visualScale, viewingDistance)

  if hapticProfile == null:
    // Use a default haptic profile
    hapticProfile = getDefaultHapticProfile()

  if interactionVelocity < SLOW_THRESHOLD:
    feedbackIntensity = hapticProfile.textureIntensity
    feedbackDuration = LONG_DURATION
  else if interactionVelocity < FAST_THRESHOLD:
    feedbackIntensity = hapticProfile.pulseIntensity
    feedbackDuration = MEDIUM_DURATION
  else:
    feedbackIntensity = hapticProfile.pulseIntensity * 2
    feedbackDuration = SHORT_DURATION

  playHapticFeedback(feedbackIntensity, feedbackDuration)
end function
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires a device with advanced haptic feedback capabilities (e.g., linear resonant actuators, ultrasonic haptics).
*   Software drivers to control haptic hardware and synchronize with UI interactions.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Accessibility:** Provide richer haptic cues for users with visual impairments.
*   **Immersive Gaming:**  Create more realistic and engaging gaming experiences.
*   **Improved Productivity:**  Provide subtle haptic feedback to confirm actions and guide users.
*   **Dynamic UI:** Change haptic textures based on element state (e.g. pressed, released).
