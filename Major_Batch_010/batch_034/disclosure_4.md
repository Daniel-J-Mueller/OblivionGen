## Adaptive Virtual Machine Resource Allocation based on Predicted Task Complexity

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing edge computing device with multi-core processor, GPU, and sufficient memory. Network connectivity (optional, for model updates).
*   **Software:** Hypervisor capable of dynamic VM resource allocation (e.g., KVM, Xen). Machine Learning model for task complexity prediction (see below). Monitoring agent within each VM. Resource allocation controller.

**Innovation Description:**

The core idea is to preemptively adjust VM resource allocation *before* a machine learning task begins, based on a predicted complexity score.  This is distinct from reactive scaling which occurs *during* task execution. The system learns to predict the resource demand of future tasks and allocates resources accordingly, leading to improved efficiency and reduced latency.

**Model Training & Prediction:**

1.  **Feature Extraction:** During initial task executions, the system monitors various features within the first VM *before* sending the configuration file to the second VM. These features include:
    *   Configuration file size (proxy for task scope).
    *   Type of computer vision operation requested (e.g., object detection, image segmentation).
    *   Resolution of input video data (from config file).
    *   Estimated frames to process (from config file).
    *   Historical performance data of similar tasks (stored in a database).
2.  **Model:** A regression-based machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) is trained to predict a “Complexity Score” based on these features.
3.  **Prediction:** When the first VM generates a new configuration file, the system extracts the relevant features and feeds them into the trained model to predict the Complexity Score.

**Resource Allocation Controller:**

1.  **Complexity Mapping:** The Complexity Score is mapped to resource allocation parameters:
    *   **CPU Cores:**  Number of CPU cores assigned to the third VM.
    *   **GPU Memory:** Amount of GPU memory allocated to the third VM.
    *   **Memory:**  RAM allocated to the third VM.
2.  **Pre-Allocation:** *Before* the second VM sends the inference request, the Resource Allocation Controller dynamically adjusts the resource allocation of the third VM based on the predicted parameters.
3.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**  A feedback loop monitors the actual resource utilization of the third VM during task execution. If the predicted allocation is insufficient, the system can dynamically increase resources (within predefined limits). If the allocation is excessive, resources are reduced, freeing them up for other tasks.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//First VM (Task Generator)
generate_config_file(task_type, video_data, parameters)
send_config_file(config_file, second_vm)

//Second VM (Task Dispatcher)
receive_config_file(config_file)
extract_features(config_file)
complexity_score = predict_complexity(extract_features)  //Using trained ML model
request_resource_allocation(complexity_score)          //Send request to Resource Allocation Controller
send_inference_request(decoded_video_data, complexity_score)

//Resource Allocation Controller
receive_resource_request(complexity_score)
resource_parameters = map_complexity_to_resources(complexity_score) //Lookup table/function
allocate_resources_to_vm(third_vm, resource_parameters)

//Third VM (Inference Engine)
receive_inference_request(decoded_video_data)
execute_inference(decoded_video_data)
send_output_data()
```

**Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency by proactively allocating resources.
*   Improved resource utilization by avoiding over-allocation.
*   Adaptive performance to varying task complexity.
*   Potential for energy savings through optimized resource allocation.
