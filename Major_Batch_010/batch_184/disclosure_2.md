## Dynamic Beam Steering with Micro-Lens Array & Spatial Light Modulator

**Concept:** Enhance the ultra-short throw projector's capabilities by implementing dynamic beam steering to create a virtual screen that adapts to the viewing environment and user preferences. This moves beyond static image projection to a more immersive and personalized experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Micro-Lens Array (MLA):** Integrate a densely packed MLA *before* the three-element projection lens.
    *   Material: Polymer (acrylic or polycarbonate) for weight reduction and ease of fabrication.
    *   Lenslet Pitch: 200-500 microns. (Adjustable based on desired beam steering resolution).
    *   Lenslet Focal Length: 1.5 - 2.5mm (tuned to the projection lens characteristics).
    *   Array Dimensions: Matched to the circular transmissive LCD dimensions.
*   **Spatial Light Modulator (SLM):** Position an SLM between the LCD and the MLA.
    *   Technology: Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) or Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS). DMD preferred for higher contrast.
    *   Resolution: Minimum 1920x1080 pixels, ideally 4K.
    *   Refresh Rate: 240Hz minimum, to reduce motion blur during beam steering.
    *   Bit Depth: 10-bit grayscale for precise light control.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated processor for real-time beam steering calculations and SLM control.
    *   Input: Room mapping data (from cameras or depth sensors). User preferences. Content being displayed.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   Room Mapping: Construct a 3D model of the room to identify surfaces (walls, ceilings, furniture).
        *   Virtual Screen Definition: Allow user to define the shape and position of the virtual screen in 3D space.
        *   Beam Steering Calculation: Calculate the angles at which each micro-lens needs to deflect the light to hit the desired location on the virtual screen. This is calculated per micro-lens.
        *   SLM Pattern Generation: Generate a grayscale pattern for the SLM that controls the amount of light deflected by each micro-lens.  Brighter pixels deflect more light.
        *   Feedback Loop: Integrate feedback from cameras to correct for distortions and ensure accurate beam steering.
*   **Illuminator Adjustment:** Implement a mechanism to dynamically adjust the light output of the LED illuminator.
    *   Control: PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for precise brightness control.
    *   Range: 10% - 100% of maximum brightness.
*   **Heat Management:** Enhance the existing heat sink to accommodate the additional heat generated by the SLM.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Beam Steering Calculation):**

```
FOR each micro-lens in MLA:
    // Get the position of the micro-lens
    micro_lens_x, micro_lens_y = get_micro_lens_position(micro_lens_index)

    // Get the desired target point on the virtual screen
    target_x, target_y, target_z = get_target_point(micro_lens_index)

    // Calculate the vector from the micro-lens to the target point
    vector_to_target = (target_x - micro_lens_x, target_y - micro_lens_y, target_z - micro_lens_z)

    // Calculate the deflection angle
    deflection_angle_x = arctan2(vector_to_target.y, vector_to_target.x)
    deflection_angle_y = arctan2(vector_to_target.z, sqrt(vector_to_target.x^2 + vector_to_target.y^2))

    // Calculate the SLM grayscale value based on the deflection angles
    grayscale_value = map(deflection_angle_x, -max_angle, max_angle, 0, 255)
    grayscale_value = clamp(grayscale_value, 0, 255)

    // Set the SLM pixel value for this micro-lens
    set_slm_pixel(micro_lens_index, grayscale_value)

END FOR
```

**Functionality:**

The MLA disperses the light from the LCD into a grid of beams. The SLM then modulates each beam individually, steering it to a specific location on the virtual screen.  This allows the projector to create a large, immersive image that is not limited by the throw distance. The dynamic adjustment of the LED illuminator ensures optimal brightness and contrast. The system can adapt to different room shapes and viewing angles, creating a personalized viewing experience.
