## Adaptive Workspace Zoning with Projected AR Guidance

**Concept:** Expand the safety system beyond halting mobile units to *actively guide* workers within the interaction area using augmented reality projections. This moves from reactive safety (stopping movement *after* a breach) to proactive guidance, minimizing the need for halts and maximizing workflow.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing Light Curtain System (as per the provided patent).
    *   Overhead Projectors (multiple, strategically positioned to cover the entire interaction area).  These must support high refresh rates and accurate geometric correction.  Consider laser projection for brightness and clarity.
    *   Worker Wearables: Lightweight AR-compatible glasses or headsets *without* requiring full VR immersion. These need precise spatial tracking capabilities (e.g., utilizing UWB or visual SLAM) and communication with the controller device.
    *   Controller Device (existing – integrates with existing sensors & wireless communication).
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Dynamic Zone Creation:** The controller dynamically creates and projects virtual "zones" onto the floor of the interaction area. These zones visually indicate safe and unsafe regions based on light curtain data and predicted mobile unit paths.  Zones are color-coded (e.g., Green = Safe, Yellow = Caution, Red = No-Go).
    *   **Path Prediction:** Utilizing historical data and real-time telemetry from mobile units, the controller predicts their future trajectories. This allows zones to *adapt* ahead of the units, providing advanced warning to workers.
    *   **AR Guidance:**  AR overlays within the worker's headset display directional arrows or highlighted pathways indicating the safest route to navigate the interaction area. This guidance adapts in real-time based on changing conditions.
    *   **Breach Response – Progressive Warning:** When a light curtain breach is detected, the system initiates a progressive warning sequence:
        1.  **Phase 1 (Yellow Zone):** The breached area is highlighted in yellow on the floor and in the worker’s AR view. A subtle audio cue is emitted.
        2.  **Phase 2 (Red Zone):** The area turns red, and the audio cue becomes more urgent.  AR guidance redirects the worker away from the breach.
        3.  **Phase 3 (Halt):** Only if the worker *ignores* the warnings does the system initiate the halt command for mobile units (as per the original patent) – minimizing unnecessary disruption.
    *   **User Profiles:** The system allows for user profiles, adapting the AR guidance based on individual roles and permissions.  For example, a maintenance worker might receive different guidance than a material handler.

**Pseudocode (Controller Device):**

```
// Initialization
Initialize Light Curtain Sensors
Initialize Overhead Projectors
Initialize Worker Wearable Tracking

// Main Loop
While (System Running) {
    Read Light Curtain Data
    Read Mobile Unit Telemetry
    Track Worker Locations
    Predict Mobile Unit Paths

    // Calculate Dynamic Zones
    SafeZones = CalculateSafeAreas(LightCurtainData, PredictedPaths)
    CautionZones = CalculateCautionAreas(LightCurtainData, PredictedPaths)
    NoGoZones = CalculateNoGoAreas(LightCurtainData)

    // Project Zones onto Floor
    ProjectZones(SafeZones, CautionZones, NoGoZones)

    // Generate AR Guidance for Each Worker
    For Each Worker {
        ARGuidance = GenerateARGuidance(WorkerLocation, SafeZones, CautionZones, NoGoZones)
        SendARGuidance(Worker)
    }

    If (LightCurtainBreachDetected) {
        // Progressive Warning Sequence
        If (WarningPhase == 1) {
            HighlightBreachArea(Yellow)
            PlayAudioCue(Subtle)
        } Else If (WarningPhase == 2) {
            HighlightBreachArea(Red)
            PlayAudioCue(Urgent)
        } Else {
            // Halt Mobile Units
            TransmitHaltSignal()
        }
    }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with a digital twin of the workspace for more accurate path prediction and zone calculation.
*   Voice guidance for workers who prefer auditory cues.
*   Automatic identification of objects within the interaction area and dynamic adjustment of zones to account for obstacles.
