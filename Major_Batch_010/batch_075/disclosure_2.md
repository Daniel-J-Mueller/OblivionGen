## Dynamic Network Personality Switching

**Concept:** Extend the interface record concept to encompass not just IP address and subnet, but entire network *personalities* – configurations defining firewall rules, QoS settings, VPN tunnels, and even pre-configured application access policies. Allow seamless switching of these personalities *while* a resource instance is actively receiving traffic.

**Specification:**

**1. Personality Definition File (PDR):**

*   Format: JSON or YAML.
*   Contents:
    *   `ip_addresses`: Array of IP addresses.
    *   `subnet_id`: Subnet identifier.
    *   `firewall_rules`: Array of firewall rule objects (source IP, destination IP, port, protocol, action).
    *   `qos_settings`: QoS parameters (priority, bandwidth limits).
    *   `vpn_tunnel_config`: Configuration data for establishing a VPN tunnel.
    *   `application_access_policy`:  List of allowed/denied applications based on port/protocol/signature.
    *   `dns_servers`: List of DNS servers to use.
    *   `routing_table`: Predefined routing table entries.

**2.  Extended Interface Record:**

*   The interface record now includes a pointer/reference to a PDR file.
*   A “personality state” flag indicating whether the current personality is active or a fallback is in use.

**3. Personality Coordinator Service:**

*   Responsible for managing PDR files and orchestrating personality switches.
*   API endpoints:
    *   `create_personality(pdr_file)`:  Creates a new personality definition.
    *   `get_personality(personality_id)`: Retrieves a personality definition.
    *   `switch_personality(interface_record_id, personality_id)`: Initiates a personality switch.  (See Algorithm below)
    *   `revert_personality(interface_record_id)`:  Reverts to the default/last-known-good personality.

**4. Algorithm for `switch_personality`:**

```pseudocode
function switch_personality(interface_record_id, personality_id):
    // 1. Load the new personality definition (PDR file).
    new_personality = load_personality(personality_id)

    // 2. Create a 'shadow' network configuration based on the new personality.
    shadow_config = create_shadow_config(new_personality)

    // 3. Enter 'transition' mode for the interface record. Block new connections.
    interface_record.transition_mode = true

    // 4. Gracefully drain existing connections. (Time-based or connection-count-based)
    while (active_connections > 0 and timeout < MAX_TIMEOUT):
        wait(1 second)

    // 5. Apply the shadow configuration to the network interface of the associated resource instance.
    apply_config(resource_instance, shadow_config)

    // 6. Update the interface record to reflect the new personality.
    interface_record.personality_id = personality_id
    interface_record.transition_mode = false

    // 7. Re-enable the interface for new connections.
    enable_interface(interface_record)
```

**5. Fault Tolerance & Rollback:**

*   Each personality switch should be logged.
*   If a switch fails (e.g., configuration error), automatically revert to the previous personality.
*   Implement health checks on the network interface to detect configuration issues.

**Use Cases:**

*   **Dynamic Security Zoning:** Switch personalities based on threat level, applying more restrictive firewall rules.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Deploy different network configurations to a subset of resource instances to evaluate performance.
*   **Temporary Access:**  Grant temporary access to sensitive resources by activating a personality with specific permissions.
*   **Disaster Recovery:**  Switch to a backup personality with different routing and DNS settings.
