## Dynamic Resource Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the policy enforcement to include *resource personas*, dynamically modifying a virtual machine's capabilities and accessible commands based on the requesting entity *and* the current system load/health.

**Specification:**

**1. Persona Definitions:**

*   **Data Structure:** A “Persona” is defined by a JSON object containing:
    *   `name`: (String) Unique identifier for the persona.
    *   `command_whitelist`: (Array of Strings) List of allowed commands.
    *   `resource_limits`: (Object) CPU, Memory, Disk I/O limits.
    *   `network_access`: (Array of IP ranges/protocols) Allowed network connections.
    *   `dependencies`: (Array of Strings) Required software/services.
    *   `priority`: (Integer) Used for resource allocation when contention arises.
*   **Storage:** Personas are stored in a central repository (e.g., a key-value store like etcd or Consul).
*   **Versioning:** Persona definitions are versioned to allow for rollback and auditing.

**2. Policy Extension:**

*   Policies no longer just specify *who* can access *what* commands, but *under which persona*.
*   A policy might state: “User ‘Alice’ can execute commands under Persona ‘DataAnalyst’ when system load is below 70%.”

**3. Dynamic Persona Assignment:**

*   **Request Interception:** All requests to execute commands on virtual machines are intercepted by a "Persona Manager" service.
*   **Contextual Analysis:** The Persona Manager analyzes:
    *   The requesting user/entity.
    *   The requested command.
    *   Current system load (CPU, memory, network).
    *   VM health metrics (disk space, error rates).
*   **Persona Selection:** Based on the analysis and defined policies, the Persona Manager selects the most appropriate persona. If no matching persona is found, the request is denied.
*   **VM Modification:** The Persona Manager uses a virtualization API (e.g., libvirt, VMware vSphere API) to dynamically modify the virtual machine:
    *   **Command Filtering:** A command filter is installed within the VM to prevent execution of commands not in the assigned persona’s `command_whitelist`.
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Resource limits (CPU, memory, disk I/O) are adjusted based on the `resource_limits` in the persona.
    *   **Network Configuration:** Firewall rules and routing tables are modified to enforce the `network_access` restrictions.
    *   **Dependency Management:** A dependency checker ensures that all required software and services are present before executing commands.  If missing, the system attempts to install them.

**4. Pseudocode (Persona Manager):**

```
function handle_request(request):
  user = request.user
  command = request.command
  vm_id = request.vm_id

  policy = find_policy(user, command)

  if policy is null:
    deny_request("No matching policy found")
    return

  persona_name = policy.persona

  persona = get_persona(persona_name)

  if persona is null:
    deny_request("Invalid persona")
    return

  system_load = get_system_load()

  if system_load > policy.load_threshold:
      deny_request("System load exceeds threshold")
      return

  apply_persona_to_vm(vm_id, persona)

  execute_command_on_vm(vm_id, command)
```

**5.  VM Agent:**

*   A lightweight agent runs within each virtual machine.
*   It receives persona definitions from the Persona Manager.
*   It enforces command filtering and resource limits.
*   It reports VM health metrics to the Persona Manager.

**Novelty:**

This system extends policy-based access control beyond simple command whitelisting to a dynamic, context-aware system that adapts VM capabilities based on the requesting entity, system load, and VM health.  The ability to dynamically modify resource limits and network access provides a much finer level of control and security. The agent within the VM is crucial to actually implementing and enforcing the dynamic policies. It is a significant expansion of the original patent’s scope.
