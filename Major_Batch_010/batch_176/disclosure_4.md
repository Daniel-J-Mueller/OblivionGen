## Adaptive Privacy Zones & Temporal Blurring

**Concept:** Expanding on the location/time-based access of video data, this system introduces user-defined “Privacy Zones” within video footage *and* a “Temporal Blur” function applied *before* any data is sent, even with consent. This prioritizes proactive privacy control beyond simple permission granting.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires existing device camera/microphone capabilities, increased local processing power (dedicated neural processing unit preferred) and secure element for key storage.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   *Privacy Zone Editor (Mobile/Desktop App):* Allows users to define polygonal areas within their recorded video – e.g., a window, a neighbor's property line. These zones are stored with associated metadata (zone ID, polygon coordinates, blur level).
    *   *Temporal Blur Engine (Local Device):* This engine applies a dynamic blur filter to video frames *before* upload. Blur intensity is determined by:
        *   User-defined default settings.
        *   Requesting agency criteria (e.g., police request for "vehicles near the incident" – engine prioritizes blurring pedestrians).
        *   Temporal sensitivity: Objects entering/exiting Privacy Zones trigger increased blur during the relevant timeframe.
    *   *Metadata Encryption Module:* All metadata (Privacy Zone definitions, temporal settings, blur levels applied) is encrypted using a user-controlled key stored in the secure element.
    *   *Consent Manager (Existing):* Integrates with existing consent mechanisms but adds a "Privacy Settings Preview" – visually demonstrates the blurring applied before consent is granted.
    *   *Requesting Agency Interface:*  Agencies submit requests with specific criteria *and* acceptable blur levels. System validates the request against user privacy settings.

**Workflow:**

1.  User defines Privacy Zones via the app, associating them with their device.
2.  Video is captured.
3.  Temporal Blur Engine applies blurring based on:
    *   Pre-defined settings
    *   Detected objects entering/exiting Privacy Zones
    *   Detected temporal anomalies (rapid movement)
4.  Requesting agency submits a request with criteria (location, time, object type) *and* acceptable blur level.
5.  System checks for matches with recorded video *and* user Privacy Zone definitions.
6.  If a match exists *and* user consent is given, video is sent *with* the applied blur. System logs the request details, consent status and blur level applied for auditability.
7.  If the request violates user Privacy Zone settings, the system logs the violation and *does not* send the video, even with consent.

**Pseudocode (Temporal Blur Engine - simplified):**

```
function applyBlur(frame, privacyZones, requestCriteria):
  blurredFrame = frame

  for each zone in privacyZones:
    if object detected in zone:
      blurIntensity = calculateBlurIntensity(object, zone, requestCriteria)
      blurredFrame = applyGaussianBlur(blurredFrame, zone, blurIntensity)

  return blurredFrame
```

**Novelty:**

This goes beyond simple permission. It allows the user to define specific areas and temporal sensitivities that are *always* respected, even with consent. The blurring is proactive, not reactive, providing a stronger privacy guarantee. This effectively implements a dynamic "redaction as a service".
