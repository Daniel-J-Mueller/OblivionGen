## Dynamic Resource Attestation with Predictive Patching

**Concept:** Extend the existing cryptographic attestation system to not only verify current host configuration, but *predict* potential vulnerabilities based on known patch schedules and proactively prepare alternate, patched configurations. This shifts from reactive verification to proactive security and availability.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Vulnerability Database (PVDB):**

*   **Data Source:** Continuously updated feed of publicly available vulnerability information (CVEs, security advisories) combined with patch release schedules from major OS/hypervisor vendors.
*   **Data Structure:**  Vulnerability entries mapped to affected components (BIOS, Hypervisor, OS Kernel, etc.) and associated patch IDs/versions.  Also includes a 'Severity Score' and 'Estimated Patch Availability' date.
*   **PVDB API:** Provides access to vulnerability information based on host component identification.

**2. Attestation Orchestration Module (AOM):**

*   **Integration:**  Interacts with existing attestation mechanisms (as described in the patent) and the PVDB.
*   **Proactive Attestation:** When a VM provisioning request is received:
    *   Identify host components.
    *   Query PVDB for vulnerabilities affecting those components with patch availability within a configurable time window (e.g., 30 days).
    *   If vulnerabilities are found:
        *   Determine if a patched configuration exists for the host.
        *   If a patched configuration *does not* exist, initiate a process to create one (see section 3).
        *   Include information about the potential vulnerability *and* the availability of a patched configuration in the attestation report sent to the user.

**3. Dynamic Configuration Provisioning (DCP):**

*   **Automated Patching/Configuration:**  Automated system for applying patches or deploying alternative configurations to a host based on pre-approved images/templates.
*   **Image Management:**  Stores pre-built images with various patch levels and configurations.  Includes version control and rollback capabilities.
*   **Zero-Downtime Updates:**  Utilizes live migration or other techniques to apply updates without interrupting running VMs.
*   **Attestation Integration:**  Before a DCP operation, a full cryptographic attestation is performed on the *target* configuration to ensure its integrity.

**4. User Interface/API Extensions:**

*   **Attestation Report:**  Extended to include vulnerability information and patching status.  Users can see potential risks and the availability of mitigations.
*   **Configuration Selection:**  Allow users to *explicitly* select a desired patch level/configuration for their VMs.
*   **Policy-Based Attestation:**  Allow administrators to define policies that automatically reject hosts with known vulnerabilities.

**Pseudocode (AOM):**

```
function ProvisionVM(request):
  host = SelectHost(request)
  components = GetHostComponents(host)
  vulnerabilities = QueryPVDB(components)

  if vulnerabilities.count > 0:
    patchedConfigAvailable = CheckPatchedConfig(host, vulnerabilities)

    if patchedConfigAvailable:
      attestationReport = GenerateAttestationReport(host, vulnerabilities, "Patched config available")
    else:
      attestationReport = GenerateAttestationReport(host, vulnerabilities, "Patched config not available - consider delaying provisioning")

  else:
    attestationReport = GenerateAttestationReport(host, [], "No vulnerabilities found")

  SendAttestationReport(request.user, attestationReport)

  if request.user.approved:
    LaunchVM(request, host)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Proactive Security:** Reduces the window of opportunity for attackers.
*   **Increased Availability:** Minimizes downtime due to patching.
*   **Enhanced Trust:** Provides users with greater transparency and control over their environment.
*   **Automated Compliance:** Helps meet security and compliance requirements.
