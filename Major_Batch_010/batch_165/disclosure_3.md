## Dynamic Memory 'Fractalization'

**Concept:** Extend the 'collapse on write' concept to create a multi-resolution memory system. Instead of simply collapsing to a primary page, the system can create progressively smaller, 'fractal' copies of data, each representing a different level of detail or resolution.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure:** Implement a tree-like structure for each block of allocated memory. The root node represents the full resolution data. Child nodes represent progressively lower resolution/detail versions of the data.
*   **Resolution Levels:** Define a configurable number of resolution levels (e.g., 1x, 1/2x, 1/4x, 1/8x). This determines the granularity of detail reduction.
*   **Content Aware Resolution:** The system automatically determines the appropriate resolution level based on the *change density* within the data. Regions with high change density retain higher resolution, while static regions can be downscaled.
*   **Access Protocol:** When data is accessed:
    1.  The system checks the requested region's current resolution.
    2.  If the requested resolution is available, return that data.
    3.  If a higher resolution exists, dynamically upscale the lower-resolution data (potentially using interpolation or learned upscaling models).
    4.  If a lower resolution exists, dynamically downscale the higher-resolution data.
*   **Write Protocol:** When data is written:
    1.  Identify the affected region.
    2.  If the write changes a significant portion of the region, create a new node for that region at the full resolution, branching from the tree.
    3.  If the write is localized, update only the relevant nodes in the tree.
    4.  Propagate changes to lower resolution nodes as needed.
*   **Memory Management:** Use a combination of copy-on-write and collapse-on-write techniques to optimize memory usage.  Unused nodes are automatically deallocated.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:**  Consider integrating specialized hardware for fast data scaling and interpolation.

**Pseudocode (Write Operation):**

```
function write_data(address, data):
  region = get_region(address)
  if region is null:
    // Out of bounds access
    return error

  if region.is_dirty:
    //Region has been modified, branch from the tree
    new_region = create_region(region.data)
    new_region.parent = region
    region = new_region

  region.data[address - region.base_address] = data
  region.is_dirty = true

  // Propagate changes to parent nodes (downscaling)
  if region.parent is not null:
    downscale(region)

  // Collapse unused branches
  collapse_unused_branches()
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced memory footprint, especially for large, mostly static datasets.
*   Improved performance by loading only the necessary resolution of data.
*   Adaptive memory usage based on data characteristics.
*   Potential for efficient data streaming and caching.

This system offers a more dynamic and granular approach to memory management than simple copy-on-write or collapse-on-write. It aims to create a memory system that adapts to the needs of the application and the characteristics of the data.
