## Dynamic Network Topology Reconstruction & Predictive Health

**Concept:** Leveraging collected network metrics to not only *detect* health issues, but to dynamically reconstruct a logical network topology and *predict* potential failures before they impact service. This moves beyond reactive monitoring towards proactive resilience.

**Specs:**

**1. Topology Reconstruction Module:**

*   **Input:** Network metric sets (as per the provided patent), resource allocation metadata (VM locations, network configurations, service dependencies).  Crucially, also ingest *configuration change events* - any time a network policy is altered, a VM is moved, etc.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a graph database (Neo4j recommended) to represent the network. Nodes represent resources (VMs, containers, network devices). Edges represent connectivity.
    *   Initially, populate the graph with static configurations from resource allocation metadata.
    *   Continuously update the graph based on observed network traffic patterns derived from metric sets. High-correlation traffic suggests direct connectivity even if not explicitly configured. Low/absent traffic suggests disconnection.  Use a Bayesian network to model confidence in edge existence based on metric history.
    *   Detect topology changes (new connections, disconnections) in real-time.
    *   Maintain multiple 'versions' of the topology, allowing rollback to previous states for analysis or fault isolation.
*   **Output:** A dynamic, real-time network topology graph.

**2. Predictive Failure Module:**

*   **Input:** Dynamic topology graph, historical network metric data, configuration change events.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Train machine learning models (Time-Series forecasting with LSTM networks or Prophet) on historical metrics *for specific paths* within the topology graph.
    *   **Path Risk Assessment:**
        *   Assign a 'risk score' to each path based on the predicted deviation from normal metric behavior.
        *   Consider 'criticality' of the path – the number of services dependent on it. This information comes from service dependency maps.
        *   Factor in the 'redundancy' of the path – how many alternative paths exist.
    *   **Failure Prediction:**
        *   If the risk score exceeds a threshold, predict a potential failure.
        *   Calculate the potential impact based on the criticality and redundancy.
*   **Output:** List of predicted failures, their potential impact, and recommended mitigation actions (e.g., traffic rerouting, resource scaling).

**3.  Mitigation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Predicted failures, topology graph, current network state.
*   **Process:**
    *   Automatically trigger mitigation actions based on pre-defined policies.
    *   Examples:
        *   Reroute traffic to alternative paths.
        *   Scale up resources on healthy nodes.
        *   Initiate automated failover procedures.
*   **Output:** Automated mitigation actions.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Failure Module - Simplified):**

```
function predict_failure(topology_graph, metric_history, path):
  predicted_metrics = time_series_forecast(metric_history[path])
  deviation = calculate_deviation(predicted_metrics, current_metrics[path])
  risk_score = deviation * path.criticality / path.redundancy
  if risk_score > threshold:
    return "Potential Failure on " + path + ". Impact: High."
  else:
    return "Path Healthy."
```

**Novelty:**  The combination of dynamic topology reconstruction *from traffic patterns*, proactive risk assessment based on path-level analysis, and automated mitigation distinguishes this from traditional monitoring systems. Most systems rely on pre-defined topologies and reactive alerting. This system learns the network and predicts problems before they occur.
