## Dynamic Phoneme Weighting for ASR Confidence

**Concept:** Expand the confidence scoring by dynamically weighting phonemes within a word based on their historical error rates *during* ASR processing, not just as static data. This enables the system to prioritize difficult or ambiguous phonemes, increasing the accuracy of confidence scores.

**Specs:**

1.  **Phoneme Error Rate Database:**
    *   Create a continually updated database logging phoneme recognition errors across a diverse audio corpus.
    *   Database fields: Phoneme ID, Error Rate (calculated as misrecognitions/total occurrences), Audio Context (e.g., noise level, speaker accent).
    *   Update frequency: Real-time or near real-time based on incoming audio data.

2.  **Real-time Phoneme Weighting:**
    *   During ASR, as phonemes are processed, retrieve their current error rate from the Phoneme Error Rate Database.
    *   Calculate a dynamic weight for each phoneme: `Weight = 1 / Error Rate`. (Higher error rate = lower weight; lower error rate = higher weight).
    *   Integrate the weights into the feature vector generation process (specifically Claim 1, relating to features corresponding to the phone and word). The existing RNN encoders will be adjusted to accommodate the weights. This will occur *after* initial feature extraction but *before* passing the data to the subsequent RNN encoder.

    ```pseudocode
    function calculate_weighted_feature_vector(phone_data, feature_vector, phoneme_error_rate_db):
      for phoneme in phone_data.phonemes:
        error_rate = phoneme_error_rate_db.get_error_rate(phoneme.id)
        weight = 1 / error_rate
        phoneme.weighted_feature = phoneme.feature * weight
      weighted_feature_vector = combine(phoneme.weighted_feature)
      return weighted_feature_vector
    ```

3.  **Confidence Score Adjustment:**
    *   After generating the fourth feature vector (Claim 1) representing the word sequence, incorporate the weighted phoneme contributions into the neural network classifier training and scoring.
    *   The classifier will be retrained to give higher weight to feature vectors derived from phonemes with historically low error rates, and lower weight to those with high error rates.
    *   Adjust the final confidence score calculation to factor in the weighted phoneme scores.

4.  **Adaptive Learning:**
    *   Implement a feedback loop where misrecognized words are flagged.
    *   The system analyzes the misrecognized word, identifies the problematic phonemes, and updates the Phoneme Error Rate Database accordingly.
    *   This allows the system to continuously learn and improve the accuracy of its confidence scores over time.

5.  **Hardware/Software Requirements:**
    *   High-performance computing infrastructure for real-time data processing.
    *   Large-scale storage for the Phoneme Error Rate Database.
    *   Machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for training the neural network classifier.
    *   Data pipelines for efficiently extracting and processing audio data.
