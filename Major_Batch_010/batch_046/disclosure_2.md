## Dynamic Graph Partitioning with Reinforcement Learning for Anomaly Detection

**Concept:** Extend the graph partitioning system not just for record matching, but for real-time anomaly detection within streaming data. Instead of a static, supervised learning model for evaluating partitions, employ a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to *dynamically* adjust partitioning strategies based on observed data characteristics and anomaly signals.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Graph Construction:**

*   **Input:** Streaming data records with defined attributes.
*   **Graph Construction:** Build a graph representation where nodes are data records and edge weights represent similarity based on attribute values. Utilize a rolling window approach to maintain a graph representing recent data.
*   **Feature Extraction:** Extract node features (e.g., attribute values, degree centrality, clustering coefficient). These form the state representation for the RL agent.

**2. Reinforcement Learning Agent:**

*   **Agent Type:** Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
*   **State Space:** Vector of node features (extracted in step 1) and graph-level features (e.g., average edge weight, number of connected components).
*   **Action Space:** Discrete actions representing different graph partitioning *techniques*. Examples:
    *   Louvain modularity maximization.
    *   Label propagation.
    *   Spectral clustering with varying parameters.
    *   Randomized partitioning.
*   **Reward Function:**  This is crucial. Define a reward based on:
    *   **Anomaly Score:**  A measure of how 'different' a partition is from expected patterns. This could be calculated using statistical measures (e.g., standard deviation of partition sizes) or unsupervised anomaly detection techniques *within* each partition.
    *   **Partition Balance:** Reward partitions that are relatively balanced in size (to avoid skewed results).
    *   **Computational Cost:** Penalize actions that are computationally expensive.
*   **Training:** Train the RL agent offline on historical data or a simulated environment. Fine-tune online with real-time data.

**3. Partitioning & Anomaly Detection:**

*   **RL Agent Action:**  At each time step, the RL agent selects a partitioning technique (an action) based on the current state.
*   **Graph Partitioning:** Apply the selected partitioning technique to the current graph.
*   **Anomaly Scoring:** Calculate an anomaly score for each partition.  High anomaly scores indicate potential anomalies.
*   **Anomaly Alerting:**  Generate alerts based on partitions exceeding a predefined anomaly threshold.

**4. Dynamic Adjustment & Feedback:**

*   **State Update:** Update the state representation based on the new graph and anomaly scores.
*   **Reward Calculation:** Calculate the reward based on the anomaly scores and partition characteristics.
*   **Policy Update:** Update the RL agent's policy to favor actions that lead to higher rewards.



**Pseudocode (RL Agent Action Selection):**

```
function select_partition_action(state, Q_network):
  // Explore vs. Exploit (Epsilon-Greedy)
  if random() < epsilon:
    action = random_action() // Random partitioning technique
  else:
    Q_values = Q_network(state)
    action = argmax(Q_values) // Best partitioning technique according to Q-network
  return action
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   GPU acceleration for Q-network training and inference.
*   Distributed computing framework (e.g., Spark) for handling large-scale graph processing.
*   Real-time data streaming platform (e.g., Kafka) for data ingestion.
*   Python with libraries like PyTorch/TensorFlow, NetworkX, and scikit-learn.
