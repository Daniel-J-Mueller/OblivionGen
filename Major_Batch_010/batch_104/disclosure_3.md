## Adaptive Feature Importance Weighting with Generative Adversarial Networks

**Concept:** Enhance fraud detection by dynamically adjusting feature importance weights using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on the decision surface itself. This moves beyond static decay coefficients or distance-based weighting, creating a self-learning system for feature relevance.

**Specifications:**

**1. GAN Architecture:**

*   **Generator (G):**  Input: Current decision surface parameters (slope, intercept for 2D, higher-order parameters for more complex surfaces). Output: A set of weights representing the importance of each input feature.  Architecture: Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with ReLU activations.  Output layer uses a sigmoid activation to constrain weights between 0 and 1.
*   **Discriminator (D):** Input:  Combined: Original input data *AND* data re-weighted using weights output by the Generator. Output: Probability score indicating whether the re-weighted data 'fits' the current decision surface. Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction followed by fully connected layers and a sigmoid output.

**2. Training Process:**

*   **Dataset:** Utilize historical transaction data labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
*   **Training Loop:**
    *   **Discriminator Training:** Train the discriminator to distinguish between original data and data re-weighted by the generator. Loss function: Binary cross-entropy.
    *   **Generator Training:** Train the generator to produce weights that 'fool' the discriminator – i.e., make the re-weighted data appear consistent with the decision surface.  Loss function:  Negative log-likelihood of the discriminator’s output.
    *   **Decision Surface Update:** The decision surface is periodically updated using the ensemble of machine learning models (as described in the patent), and this updated surface is fed back as input to the GAN.
    *   **Regularization:** Add a regularization term to the generator’s loss function to prevent weights from becoming overly concentrated on a single feature.

**3. Integration with Existing System:**

*   **Replace Decay Coefficient/Distance Weighting:** Remove the existing decay coefficient or distance-based weighting mechanisms.
*   **Feature Re-weighting:** Before inputting data into the ensemble of machine learning models, multiply each feature value by the corresponding weight output by the GAN.
*   **Real-time Operation:** The GAN should operate in real-time, providing updated feature weights for each incoming transaction.

**4. Pseudocode (GAN training loop):**

```
# Initialize GAN (Generator G, Discriminator D)
# Initialize Ensemble of ML Models

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in data_loader:
        # Get real data batch (X_real)

        # Generate weights using Generator (weights = G(current_decision_surface))
        weights = G(current_decision_surface)

        # Re-weight data (X_reweighted = X_real * weights)
        X_reweighted = X_real * weights

        # Train Discriminator
        D_loss = binary_cross_entropy(D(X_real), 1) + binary_cross_entropy(D(X_reweighted), 0)
        optimize(D, D_loss)

        # Train Generator
        G_loss = binary_cross_entropy(D(X_reweighted), 1) + regularization_term(weights)
        optimize(G, G_loss)

    # Update Decision Surface using Ensemble of ML Models
    current_decision_surface = update_decision_surface(ensemble_of_ml_models)
```

**5. Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   GPU-accelerated computing for GAN training and real-time inference.
*   Deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Data pipeline for real-time data ingestion and processing.
*   Monitoring and logging tools for performance evaluation and debugging.
