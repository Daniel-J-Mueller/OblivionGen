## Adaptive Trust Zones with Dynamic Data Masking

**Concept:** Extend the proxy-based trust zone concept to dynamically adjust trust levels and data exposure *within* the trusted zone itself, based on real-time behavioral analysis of internal systems. This moves beyond a simple “in/out” trust boundary to a granular, constantly shifting landscape.

**Specification:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Trust Zone Proxy (TZP):** (Existing from patent) - Handles initial in/out traffic.
*   **Internal Behavioral Analyzer (IBA):** New component. Monitors activity *within* the trusted zone. This is a distributed system, with agents on key servers.
*   **Dynamic Data Masking Engine (DDME):** New component. Receives instructions from the IBA and selectively masks/redacts data in transit *within* the trusted zone.
*   **Policy Engine (PE):** Defines rules for the IBA and DDME, configurable through a user interface. 

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Baseline Establishment:** The IBA establishes a baseline of “normal” behavior for each internal system within the trusted zone. This includes network traffic patterns, resource usage, API calls, and data access patterns.
2.  **Anomaly Detection:** The IBA continuously monitors systems for deviations from the baseline. Anomalies trigger a risk score.
3.  **Risk-Based Masking:**  Based on the risk score, the PE instructs the DDME to apply masking rules to specific data fields in messages traveling *within* the trusted zone.  
    *   **Example:** If a database server exhibits unusual query patterns, the DDME might redact sensitive fields (PII, financial data) from queries sent to that server *from other* trusted systems.
4.  **Adaptive Trust Levels:** The system dynamically adjusts trust levels for internal systems based on observed behavior.  A system exhibiting consistent anomalies may be temporarily relegated to a lower trust level.
5.  **Alerting & Reporting:** The system generates alerts for significant anomalies and provides detailed reports on trust level changes and data masking activity.

**3. Pseudocode (IBA – Anomaly Detection):**

```
function analyze_system_activity(system_id, activity_log):
    baseline = get_baseline(system_id)
    risk_score = 0

    // Network Traffic Analysis
    risk_score += calculate_network_anomaly_score(activity_log.network_traffic, baseline.network_traffic)

    // Resource Usage Analysis
    risk_score += calculate_resource_anomaly_score(activity_log.resource_usage, baseline.resource_usage)

    // API Call Analysis
    risk_score += calculate_api_anomaly_score(activity_log.api_calls, baseline.api_calls)

    // Data Access Pattern Analysis
    risk_score += calculate_data_access_anomaly_score(activity_log.data_access, baseline.data_access)

    if risk_score > threshold:
        trigger_alert(system_id, risk_score)
        update_system_trust_level(system_id, "low")  // Or intermediate level
        instruct_ddme(system_id, risk_score) //Instruct DDME to apply masking to outbound traffic
    else:
        update_system_trust_level(system_id, "high")

    return risk_score

function calculate_anomaly_score(current_data, baseline_data):
    // Implement statistical anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., standard deviation, z-score)
    // Return a score representing the degree of deviation from the baseline
    return anomaly_score
```

**4.  Data Masking Techniques (DDME):**

*   **Field-Level Redaction:** Mask specific data fields (e.g., credit card numbers, SSNs).
*   **Data Substitution:** Replace sensitive data with dummy values.
*   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data with a key managed by the system.
*   **Data Tokenization:** Replace sensitive data with non-sensitive tokens.
*   **Dynamic Data Minimization:** Only transmit the minimum amount of data necessary for the operation.

**5. User Interface Elements:**

*   **System Trust Level Dashboard:** Visual representation of trust levels for each system.
*   **Anomaly Alert Console:** Real-time display of anomaly alerts.
*   **Policy Editor:** Configurable rules for the IBA and DDME.
*   **Masking Rule Editor:** Define masking rules for specific data fields.
*   **Auditing & Reporting Tools:** Generate reports on trust level changes, anomaly alerts, and data masking activity.
