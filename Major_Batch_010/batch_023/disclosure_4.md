## Dynamic RF Mapping & Predictive Handover

**System Overview:** A distributed system leveraging user device data to create a hyper-local, real-time RF environment map, coupled with a predictive handover system that anticipates connection degradation *before* it happens, proactively adjusting network connections.

**Core Components:**

*   **User Device Agent:** Software running on user devices (smartphones, tablets, IoT devices). Collects:
    *   Real-time RF signal strength (RSSI, RSRP, RSRQ) for all available cellular bands *and* Wi-Fi networks.
    *   GPS/Location data (high precision when available).
    *   Connection quality metrics (packet loss, latency, jitter).
    *   Active connection type (cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).
*   **Edge Servers:** Local servers (potentially deployed at cell towers, cafes, or public spaces) receiving data from User Device Agents.
*   **Central Server:** Aggregates data from Edge Servers, performs advanced analysis, and manages the RF environment map.

**Data Flow & Processing:**

1.  **Data Collection:** User Device Agents continuously sample RF data and send it to the nearest Edge Server. Data is timestamped and geo-tagged.
2.  **Edge Processing:** Edge Servers perform preliminary data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation. This reduces latency and bandwidth requirements.
3.  **Map Creation:** The Central Server receives aggregated data from Edge Servers and constructs a dynamic RF environment map. The map is represented as a grid, with each cell containing:
    *   Average signal strength for each band.
    *   Signal quality metrics (packet loss, latency).
    *   Network type (cellular, Wi-Fi).
    *   Historical connectivity data.
    *   User density.
4.  **Predictive Handover:** When a user device is moving, the system predicts potential connectivity issues by:
    *   Analyzing the RF environment map along the user's trajectory.
    *   Identifying areas with weak signal strength or high congestion.
    *   Predicting signal degradation based on speed and direction of travel.
5.  **Proactive Adjustment:** Before the user experiences a connection drop, the system:
    *   Initiates a handover to a stronger signal (cellular or Wi-Fi).
    *   Optimizes network settings (e.g., channel selection, power control).
    *   Pre-fetches data to minimize interruption.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Handover Algorithm):**

```
function predict_handover(user_device, trajectory)
  map_data = get_rf_map_data(trajectory)
  predicted_signal_strength = calculate_predicted_signal(map_data, user_device.speed, user_device.direction)
  if predicted_signal_strength < threshold
    best_network = find_best_network(map_data, user_device.location)
    if best_network != current_network
      initiate_handover(best_network)
      return true // Handover initiated
    else
      return false // No handover needed
  else
    return false // No handover needed
end function
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   User Devices: Standard smartphones, tablets, IoT devices with GPS and network connectivity.
*   Edge Servers: Small form-factor servers with sufficient processing power and storage.
*   Central Server: High-performance server cluster with scalable storage.

**Software Requirements:**

*   User Device Agent: Mobile app (iOS, Android) or embedded software.
*   Edge Server Software: Data aggregation and processing engine.
*   Central Server Software: Map creation, analysis, and control engine.
*   Communication Protocol: Secure and reliable communication protocol between devices and servers.

**Novelty:**

*   **Hyper-Local Mapping:**  Focuses on creating extremely detailed, real-time maps of the RF environment, going beyond traditional network coverage maps.
*   **Predictive Handover:**  Anticipates connectivity issues *before* they happen, minimizing interruption and improving user experience.
*   **Distributed Architecture:**  Leverages edge computing to reduce latency and bandwidth requirements.
*   **Adaptive Optimization:**  Dynamically adjusts network settings based on real-time conditions.
