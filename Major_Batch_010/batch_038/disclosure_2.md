## Dynamic Contact Enrichment & Predictive Routing

**System Goal:** Enhance contact resolution and predictive communication routing beyond simple identifier replacement, leveraging contextual data and predicted user intent.

**Core Innovation:** The system proactively enriches contact information *before* a communication attempt and predicts the *optimal* communication channel based on user history, inferred context, and dynamic availability.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Contextual Data Intake:**
    *   Audio Input: Continuous monitoring of ambient audio (with user permission). Analysis for keywords, sentiment, and speaker identification.
    *   Text Input: Analysis of incoming text messages, emails, and social media interactions.
    *   Location Data: Real-time location tracking (with user permission) to infer context (e.g., “at work,” “traveling”).
    *   Calendar Integration: Access to user calendar data to infer meeting schedules and potential availability.
    *   Device Sensor Data: Leverage device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope) to infer activity (e.g., “driving,” “walking”).

2.  **Dynamic Contact Enrichment Module:**
    *   Contact Graph: Maintain a dynamic contact graph for each user, storing not just identifiers (phone number, email) but also:
        *   Relationship Type: (friend, family, colleague, service provider) – inferred from interaction patterns.
        *   Communication Preferences: Preferred channel (voice, text, video), time of day, and frequency.  Learned through user feedback and observation.
        *   Contextual Tags: Tags indicating the context in which the contact is typically engaged (e.g., "work-related," "emergency," "social").
        *   Availability Status: Real-time availability based on calendar, location, and device status.

    *   Enrichment Process:
        *   When a new message is received or a contact is identified, the system queries the contact graph.
        *   If a match is found, the system retrieves the enriched contact information.
        *   If no match is found, the system attempts to infer contact information from the message content and external sources (e.g., social media, public directories).
        *   The enriched contact information is stored in the contact graph for future use.

3.  **Predictive Routing Engine:**

    *   Communication Request: A user initiates a communication request (e.g., replying to a message, making a call).
    *   Context Analysis: The system analyzes the message content, user context (location, activity, calendar), and enriched contact information.
    *   Channel Prediction: Based on the context analysis, the system predicts the optimal communication channel (voice, text, video, email). The algorithm considers:
        *   Urgency: Inferred from message content and context.
        *   Complexity:  Long messages or requests requiring detailed explanation favor voice or video.
        *   User Preference: Prioritize the contact’s preferred channel.
        *   Availability: Route to the channel where the contact is most likely to be available.

    *   Dynamic Routing: The system automatically routes the communication request to the predicted channel.

4.  **Pseudocode - Predictive Routing Algorithm**

```pseudocode
function predict_communication_channel(message_content, user_context, contact_info) {
  urgency = analyze_urgency(message_content)
  complexity = analyze_complexity(message_content)
  preferred_channel = contact_info.preferred_channel
  availability = check_contact_availability(contact_info)

  if (urgency == HIGH && availability == AVAILABLE) {
    return preferred_channel  // Direct to preference if urgent & available
  } else if (complexity == HIGH) {
    return VIDEO  // Use video for complex topics
  } else if (preferred_channel != NULL && availability == AVAILABLE){
    return preferred_channel
  } else {
    return TEXT // Default to text
  }
}
```

5.  **Additional Features:**
    *   Automated Context Sharing:  The system can proactively share relevant context with the contact (e.g., “I’m running late for our meeting,” “I’m calling about your email from yesterday”).
    *   Intelligent Do Not Disturb: The system can intelligently filter incoming communications based on user context and priority.
    *   Cross-Channel Communication: Seamlessly transition between different communication channels without losing context.
