## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Predictive Triggering

**System Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum 8-element circular array, optimized for 360° spatial audio capture. High SNR microphones required.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated edge TPU or equivalent for low-latency processing.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Scene Analyzer:**  Utilizes advanced sound event detection (SED) and audio source localization (ASL) algorithms. Capable of identifying and mapping distinct sound sources within the environment (e.g., TV, music player, human speech, appliance noise).  Output: 3D map of active sound sources, updated in real-time.
    *   **Predictive Trigger Engine:**  Employs a recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, trained on historical acoustic scene data. The LSTM predicts the probability of various sound events occurring in specific spatial locations over a short time horizon (e.g., 2-5 seconds). 
    *   **Trigger Expression Monitor:**  A beamforming network, similar to the original patent, but dynamically adjusted based on the Predictive Trigger Engine’s output.
    *   **Confidence Fusion:** Module integrating the expression detector’s confidence with the Predictive Trigger Engine’s confidence to make a final determination of a valid trigger expression.
*   **Data Storage:** Local storage for historical acoustic scene data (limited duration) and model updates.

**Innovation Description:**

This system moves beyond reactive trigger expression detection to *proactive* detection. Instead of solely relying on detecting a trigger phrase *after* it’s spoken amidst interfering sounds, we leverage a learned model of the acoustic environment to anticipate potential interference and *prepare* for the trigger expression. 

**Workflow:**

1.  **Continuous Acoustic Scene Analysis:** The Acoustic Scene Analyzer constantly monitors the environment, creating a real-time 3D map of sound sources.
2.  **Predictive Modeling:** The LSTM network, trained on historical acoustic data for that environment, predicts the likely evolution of the acoustic scene.  For example, if the TV is typically turned on at 6 PM, the LSTM will increase the probability of TV noise in that spatial location as 6 PM approaches.
3.  **Dynamic Beamforming Adjustment:** Based on the LSTM’s predictions, the Trigger Expression Monitor dynamically adjusts the beamforming network. 
    *   If the LSTM predicts a high probability of TV noise from a specific direction, the beamformer *preemptively* attenuates sound from that direction while simultaneously increasing sensitivity to speech from the expected user location.
    *   The system can also *focus* on regions where speech is *least* likely to be obscured by predicted interference.
4.  **Expression Detection & Confidence Fusion:** The expression detector analyzes the dynamically processed audio. The Confidence Fusion module combines the detector’s confidence score with the Predictive Trigger Engine's confidence in the effectiveness of the audio processing (i.e., how well interference was mitigated) to make a final decision about whether a valid trigger expression has been uttered.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
//Initialization
train_lstm(historical_acoustic_data)

//Main Loop
while (true) {
  acoustic_scene = analyze_acoustic_scene(microphone_array)
  predicted_scene = predict_acoustic_scene(acoustic_scene, lstm_model)

  //Adjust beamforming network based on predicted scene
  beamforming_weights = calculate_beamforming_weights(predicted_scene)
  apply_beamforming_weights(microphone_array, beamforming_weights)

  trigger_score = detect_trigger_expression(processed_audio)
  prediction_confidence = calculate_prediction_confidence(predicted_scene, trigger_score)
  
  if (trigger_score > threshold AND prediction_confidence > confidence_threshold) {
      activate_speech_recognition()
  }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **User-Specific Acoustic Profiles:**  Train the LSTM model on data collected from individual users to personalize the acoustic scene prediction and interference mitigation.
*   **Multi-Room Acoustic Mapping:**  Extend the system to map and predict acoustic scenes across multiple rooms, allowing for seamless voice control throughout a home or office.
*   **Integration with Smart Home Devices:** Utilize data from smart home devices (e.g., TV power state, music player volume) to further refine the acoustic scene prediction.
