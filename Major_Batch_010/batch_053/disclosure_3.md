## Dynamic Event Graph Construction with Temporal Reasoning

**Concept:** Extend event extraction to not just *identify* events and entities, but to construct a dynamic, evolving graph representing relationships *over time*. This moves beyond static snapshots of events to a continuous understanding of how events and entities interact.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Temporal Event Node:** Each extracted event becomes a node in the graph. This node stores:
    *   Event Type (from existing system)
    *   Timestamp (precise, potentially derived from document metadata or heuristics)
    *   Confidence Score (from event extraction model)
    *   Associated Entities (linked node IDs)
*   **Entity Node:**  Each extracted entity becomes a node, storing:
    *   Entity Type (from existing system)
    *   Attributes (e.g., location, organization, person)
    *   Relevant Event IDs (linking to participating events)
*   **Relationship Edge:**  Edges connect event and entity nodes, indicating the semantic role the entity plays in the event (e.g., Agent, Patient, Instrument). Edges also store a *temporal validity range* (start/end timestamp) indicating when the relationship holds true.

**II. Temporal Reasoning Engine:**

*   **Conflict Resolution:** When multiple event extractions suggest conflicting relationships for the same entity pair, the engine uses temporal validity ranges and confidence scores to prioritize the most likely relationship.  A scoring function combines:
    *   Confidence Score of Event Extraction
    *   Duration of Temporal Validity
    *   Recency (how close the event is to the "current" time – useful for streaming data)
*   **Temporal Inference:**  The engine infers implicit relationships based on temporal proximity and event type.  For example:
    *   If Entity A "attends" Event X at time T, and Entity B "presents" at Event X at time T, infer a "colleague" relationship between A and B.
    *   If Event Y occurs immediately after Event X and involves the same entities, infer a causal relationship (with a confidence score).
*   **Event Horizon:** A configurable “event horizon” limits the number of past events considered. Events outside the horizon are archived or summarized to maintain performance.

**III. Implementation Details:**

*   **Graph Database:**  Use a graph database (e.g., Neo4j, JanusGraph) to store and query the dynamic event graph efficiently.
*   **Streaming Data Support:**  The system should be able to ingest event extractions in real-time from streaming sources (e.g., news feeds, social media).
*   **API:** Provide an API for querying the graph:
    *   `getEventsForEntity(entityID, startTime, endTime)`
    *   `getEntitiesForEvent(eventID)`
    *   `getRelationships(entityID1, entityID2, startTime, endTime)`
    *   `inferRelationships(entityID1, entityID2, inferenceType)`

**IV. Pseudocode – Temporal Inference Example**

```
function inferRelationship(entity1, entity2, inferenceType):
  // inferenceType: "colleague", "causal", etc.
  relevantEvents = getEventsForEntities(entity1, entity2, timeWindow)

  if inferenceType == "colleague":
    colleagueEvents = filterEvents(relevantEvents, ["attend", "present"])
    if count(colleagueEvents) > threshold:
      return {type: "colleague", confidence: calculateConfidence(colleagueEvents)}
    else:
      return null

  if inferenceType == "causal":
    // Check for temporal proximity and event types suggestive of causality
    if event1.timestamp + timeDelta < event2.timestamp and
       event1.type in ["initiate", "trigger"] and
       event2.type in ["result", "consequence"]:
         return {type: "causal", confidence: calculateConfidence(events)}
       else:
         return null

  // Add other inference rules as needed
  return null
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond extracting isolated events to creating a *dynamic knowledge graph* that evolves over time. The temporal reasoning engine allows for inferring implicit relationships and understanding event sequences, providing a much richer understanding of the underlying data.  The system isn't just identifying *what* happened, but *how* things are connected and *why* they happened.
