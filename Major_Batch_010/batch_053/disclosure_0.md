## Dynamic Skill Composition via Predictive Feedback Analysis

**Concept:** Augment the existing feedback loop to *proactively* suggest skill compositions for handling complex dialogs, rather than reactively adjusting based on negative feedback. This system anticipates user needs and dynamically assembles a ‘skill chain’ *before* a response is generated, optimizing for both accuracy and user experience.

**Specs:**

1.  **Predictive Feedback Model:** Train a model (likely a transformer-based architecture) on historical dialog data (including positive *and* negative feedback).  This model will predict the likelihood of various feedback types (e.g., "not helpful," "inaccurate," "too verbose") given the current dialog state (user input, system output, dialog history).

2.  **Skill Graph:** Construct a graph representing available skills. Nodes are skills (e.g., "weather retrieval," "restaurant booking," "fact verification"). Edges represent compatibility/dependencies between skills (e.g., “fact verification” *requires* “information retrieval”). Edge weights represent the strength of the dependency or suitability for chaining.

3.  **Skill Chain Planner:**  Given a user input, the system:
    *   Passes the input to the Predictive Feedback Model to estimate the probability distribution over potential feedback types.
    *   Uses the feedback distribution to identify the skills most likely to mitigate negative feedback. (e.g., high probability of "inaccurate" suggests prioritizing "fact verification").
    *   Utilizes the Skill Graph and a search algorithm (A*, Dijkstra's) to find the optimal skill chain to address the predicted feedback and fulfill the user request.  Optimization criteria include minimizing predicted negative feedback probability and minimizing latency.
    *   The planner will also utilize a cost function that is adjustable per skill. This cost function determines the priority of different skills being added to the chain. 

4.  **Dynamic Skill Invocation:**  Instead of a single skill handling the entire request, the system activates the planned skill chain sequentially.  Each skill’s output becomes the input for the next skill in the chain.

5.  **Feedback Integration & Chain Refinement:**  Actual user feedback is used to refine the Predictive Feedback Model *and* adjust the Skill Graph edge weights.  If the predicted feedback is significantly different from the actual feedback, the system updates its models to improve future predictions and skill chain planning. A reinforcement learning algorithm could be used to adjust weights.

**Pseudocode (Skill Chain Planner):**

```
FUNCTION PlanSkillChain(userInput, dialogHistory):
  feedbackDistribution = PredictiveFeedbackModel(userInput, dialogHistory)
  targetSkills = IdentifyTargetSkills(feedbackDistribution) // Skills to mitigate predicted negative feedback

  skillChain = SearchSkillGraph(targetSkills, userInput, dialogHistory) // A* or Dijkstra's search

  RETURN skillChain

FUNCTION SearchSkillGraph(targetSkills, userInput, dialogHistory):
  // A* or Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation
  // Start Node:  Initial skill based on user intent recognition
  // Goal Node:  Skill chain that minimizes predicted negative feedback
  // Cost Function: Combination of predicted feedback probability & latency
  // Heuristic: Estimate remaining cost to reach goal

  skillChain = [] //List of skills
  skillChain.append(startNode)

  WHILE (not GoalReached):
    nextNode = FindBestNextNode(current_node, skillChain)
    skillChain.append(nextNode)
  
  RETURN skillChain
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires significant computational resources for training and running the Predictive Feedback Model. GPUs are recommended.
*   The Skill Graph can be implemented as a database or in-memory graph structure.
*   A message queuing system (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) can be used to manage communication between skills.
*   APIs for skills need to be standardized for seamless integration.
