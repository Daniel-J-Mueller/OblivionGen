## Dynamic Data Provenance & Attestation via Immutable Chains

**Concept:** Extend the existing owner-defined code execution framework to not only *transform* data in transit but also to create an immutable, verifiable audit trail of every modification. This moves beyond simple filtering/masking to establishing true data provenance and attestation.

**Specs:**

1.  **Provenance Data Structure:** Define a standardized data structure (e.g., JSON) to encapsulate provenance information. This structure *must* include:
    *   `timestamp`: UTC timestamp of the modification.
    *   `owner_id`: Identifier of the owner initiating the modification.
    *   `code_hash`: Cryptographic hash of the owner-defined code executed.  This guarantees code integrity.
    *   `input_hash`: Cryptographic hash of the input data *before* modification.
    *   `output_hash`: Cryptographic hash of the output data *after* modification.
    *   `operation_name`: Descriptive name of the operation performed (e.g., "Redact PII," "Apply Encryption," "Normalize Values").
    *   `parameters`:  Serialized parameters used by the owner-defined code.

2.  **Immutable Chain Integration:** Integrate a lightweight, append-only immutable data structure (e.g., Merkle DAG, blockchain-inspired) *within* the object storage service. Each modification event (provenance data structure) is appended as a new 'block' to this chain.

3.  **Modified Execution Pipeline:** Alter the existing owner-defined code execution pipeline.
    *   Before code execution: Calculate and store `input_hash`.
    *   After code execution: Calculate and store `output_hash`.
    *   Construct the provenance data structure.
    *   Append the provenance data structure to the immutable chain.

4.  **Attestation API:** Provide an API endpoint that allows any authorized party (including auditors, regulators, or other owners) to:
    *   Request the complete provenance history of a given object.
    *   Verify the integrity of the provenance data (using cryptographic hashes and chain validation).
    *   Demonstrate that any given object is in compliance with specified data governance policies.

**Pseudocode (Attestation API - simplified):**

```
function get_object_provenance(object_id):
  // Fetch the entire immutable chain
  chain = get_immutable_chain()

  // Filter the chain to include only events related to the specified object_id
  relevant_events = filter(chain, event -> event.object_id == object_id)

  // Return the filtered events
  return relevant_events

function verify_provenance(event, expected_hash):
  // Calculate the hash of the event data
  calculated_hash = hash(event.data)

  // Compare the calculated hash to the expected hash
  if calculated_hash == expected_hash:
    return True
  else:
    return False

function get_chain_root():
    //Return the root hash of the Merkle DAG
    return get_root_hash()
```

**Innovation:** This shifts the focus from simple data transformation to *guaranteed data integrity and traceability*. Itâ€™s not just about *what* was changed, but *who* changed it, *when*, *how*, and *why*.  The immutable chain provides undeniable proof of data lineage, which is critical for compliance, auditing, and building trust in data-driven applications. The hash also allows for constant validation of the integrity of the data in transit.
