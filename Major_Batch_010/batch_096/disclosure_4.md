## Dynamic Trust Scoring & Adaptive Access Control

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** "Trust Engine" - a microservice responsible for calculating and maintaining a dynamic trust score for each registered device.
*   **Data Inputs (Trust Score Calculation):**
    *   Device Registration Data (as per existing patent) - initial baseline score.
    *   Network Behavior Analysis:  Real-time monitoring of device network traffic (volume, frequency, destination patterns).
    *   Resource Usage Patterns: CPU, memory, bandwidth consumption. Anomalies trigger score adjustments.
    *   Geolocation Data (Optional, User Consent Required): Deviation from expected location triggers score adjustment.
    *   Integrity Checks: Periodic validation of device software and firmware integrity against known good hashes.
    *   User Behavior (if applicable, linked to user account): Access times, frequently accessed resources, and command patterns.
*   **Trust Score Range:** 0-100 (0 = Untrusted, 100 = Fully Trusted)
*   **Adaptive Access Control Policies:**  Implemented as a policy engine integrated with the Trust Engine. Policies define access levels based on trust score ranges.  Example:
    *   Trust Score 90-100: Full Access
    *   Trust Score 70-89:  Limited Access (read-only for sensitive data)
    *   Trust Score 50-69:  Restricted Access (requires multi-factor authentication, time-limited access)
    *   Trust Score 0-49:  Blocked Access – Requires manual review and remediation.
*   **Alerting & Remediation:**  Automated alerts triggered when a device's trust score drops below a threshold. Automated remediation actions:
    *   Temporary access restriction.
    *   Initiate integrity check.
    *   Request user intervention.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Secure gRPC for inter-service communication.
*   **Data Storage:** Time-series database for storing trust score history and associated metrics.

**Pseudocode (Trust Engine - Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(deviceId):
  baseScore = getBaseScore(deviceId) // From registration data
  networkScore = analyzeNetworkBehavior(deviceId)
  resourceScore = analyzeResourceUsage(deviceId)
  integrityScore = performIntegrityCheck(deviceId)
  geoScore = analyzeGeoLocation(deviceId) //Optional

  //Weighted average - weights can be adjusted based on sensitivity
  totalScore = (0.3 * baseScore) + (0.25 * networkScore) + (0.2 * resourceScore) + (0.15 * integrityScore) + (0.1 * geoScore)

  //Apply threshold & clipping
  if totalScore > 100:
    totalScore = 100
  if totalScore < 0:
    totalScore = 0

  updateTrustScore(deviceId, totalScore)
  return totalScore
```

**Innovation Description:**

This system extends the core device registration and authentication by adding a *dynamic* layer of trust. Instead of solely relying on initial registration data, the system continuously monitors device behavior and adapts access controls accordingly. This provides a more robust and proactive security posture, mitigating the risk of compromised or malicious devices gaining access to sensitive resources. The scoring system is customizable, allowing administrators to prioritize different security metrics based on their specific needs. It’s not about *blocking* devices, it's about *adapting* to their behavior, granting increasing or decreasing levels of access. This introduces a self-healing quality to the overall system, reducing the need for manual intervention and improving overall security.
