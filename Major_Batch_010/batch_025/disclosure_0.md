## Variable Geometry Ducted Fan System

**Concept:** Integrate the adjustable wing/tailplane concepts with ducted fan propulsion, creating a system where the duct geometry itself dynamically changes to optimize thrust vectoring and aerodynamic efficiency across various flight regimes. This goes beyond simple propeller protection and becomes a primary flight control and performance enhancement feature.

**Specifications:**

**1. Duct Construction:**

*   **Material:** Lightweight composite material (carbon fiber reinforced polymer) with integrated shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators.
*   **Segmentation:** Each duct is divided into multiple (8-12) independently controllable segments. These segments are essentially flaps integrated *into* the duct walls.
*   **Actuation:** Each segment is driven by a miniature linear actuator powered by the vehicle’s main battery. SMA actuators provide a backup/fine-tuning control mechanism.
*   **Sensors:** Strain gauges embedded within each duct segment to monitor deformation and provide feedback to the control system.

**2. Control System:**

*   **Inputs:** Vehicle speed, altitude, attitude, desired flight path, obstacle detection data, and motor/propeller performance metrics.
*   **Algorithm:** A predictive control algorithm (Model Predictive Control – MPC) that calculates the optimal duct segment positions for maximum thrust, efficiency, and maneuverability.
*   **Modes:**
    *   **Vertical Takeoff/Landing (VTOL):** Duct segments extend outward, creating a larger annular area for increased static thrust and improved stability. Segments can also vector thrust slightly downwards for better control.
    *   **Forward Flight:** Duct segments streamline, minimizing drag and maximizing forward thrust. The segments subtly adjust to counteract roll, pitch, and yaw.
    *   **Maneuvering:** Duct segments dynamically adjust to create asymmetric thrust vectoring, enabling rapid and precise turns.
    *   **Obstacle Avoidance:** Duct segments rapidly reshape to deflect airflow around obstacles or provide additional protection.
    *   **Emergency Landing:** Duct segments extend and broaden to create a larger impact area and reduce landing speed.

**3. Integration with Existing Systems:**

*   **Wing/Tailplane Linkage:** The duct geometry adjustments are coordinated with the adjustable wing/tailplane features to provide a unified flight control surface.
*   **Motor Control:** Motor speed and duct geometry are integrated, allowing for efficient power distribution and optimized thrust vectoring.
*   **Power Management:** Dedicated power management system to ensure sufficient power to the actuators while minimizing energy consumption.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// Main Control Loop
while (VehicleActive) {
  // Read Sensor Data
  speed = ReadSpeed();
  altitude = ReadAltitude();
  attitude = ReadAttitude();
  obstacles = DetectObstacles();
  desiredPath = GetDesiredPath();

  // Calculate Optimal Duct Geometry
  ductGeometry = CalculateDuctGeometry(speed, altitude, attitude, obstacles, desiredPath);

  // Actuate Duct Segments
  for (segment in ductSegments) {
    segment.SetPosition(ductGeometry[segment.ID]);
  }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced Maneuverability: Precise thrust vectoring enables rapid turns and agile flight.
*   Improved Efficiency: Optimized duct geometry reduces drag and maximizes thrust.
*   Increased Safety: Obstacle avoidance and emergency landing features enhance safety.
*   Reduced Noise: Streamlined duct design can reduce propeller noise.
*   Compact Design: The integrated system allows for a more compact and streamlined vehicle design.
