## Personalized Label Weighting via Biofeedback

**System Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Biofeedback Sensor Suite:** Non-invasive sensors (EEG, GSR, heart rate variability) integrated into a standard user interface device (e.g., headset, mouse, keyboard). Wireless communication (Bluetooth 5.0 or higher) to a processing unit.
*   **Processing Unit:** Edge computing device (integrated into the UI device or a nearby hub) with sufficient processing power for real-time signal processing and feature extraction.
*   **Data Storage:** Local storage on the processing unit for temporary storage of biofeedback data and user preferences. Secure cloud storage for aggregated, anonymized data (optional, user consent required).

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Biofeedback Signal Processing Module:** Algorithms to filter noise, extract relevant features (e.g., alpha/theta band power in EEG, skin conductance level, heart rate variability metrics), and quantify user emotional/cognitive states (e.g., engagement, frustration, cognitive load).
*   **Label Weighting Engine:** Core module that dynamically adjusts the importance score of classification labels based on real-time biofeedback data. See pseudocode below.
*   **User Profile Manager:** Stores user-specific preferences, historical biofeedback data, and learned weighting patterns.
*   **API Integration:** Interfaces with existing classification systems to provide updated label importance scores.
*   **Calibration Module:** Guides users through a brief calibration process to establish baseline biofeedback responses and personalize the system.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initialization:** User initiates a browsing/shopping session. Biofeedback sensors are activated. System loads user profile and calibration data.
2.  **Real-time Data Acquisition:** Biofeedback sensors continuously collect data during user interaction with the interface.
3.  **Signal Processing & State Estimation:** Biofeedback Signal Processing Module filters and analyzes the data, estimating the user’s emotional/cognitive state.
4.  **Dynamic Weighting:** Label Weighting Engine adjusts label importance scores based on the estimated state.
5.  **Classification Update:** Updated label scores are provided to the classification system, influencing item ranking and recommendations.
6.  **Learning & Adaptation:** User preferences and biofeedback patterns are stored in the User Profile Manager, refining the system’s accuracy over time.

**Pseudocode – Label Weighting Engine:**

```
// INPUTS:
//    user_state: Estimated emotional/cognitive state (e.g., Engagement, Frustration)
//    label_data:  Current importance score for each label

// CONSTANTS:
//    engagement_boost:  Factor to increase label scores during high engagement
//    frustration_penalty: Factor to decrease label scores during high frustration

FUNCTION adjust_label_weight(label_data, user_state)

    FOR EACH label IN label_data
        base_score = label.importance_score

        IF user_state == "Engagement"
            adjusted_score = base_score * (1 + engagement_boost)
        ELSE IF user_state == "Frustration"
            adjusted_score = base_score * (1 - frustration_penalty)
        ELSE
            adjusted_score = base_score

        label.importance_score = adjusted_score

    END FOR

    RETURN label_data

END FUNCTION

```

**Novelty:** Existing systems rely on explicit user feedback (clicks, ratings) or broad demographic data. This design incorporates *implicit* biofeedback to infer user emotional/cognitive states and *dynamically* adjust label weighting in *real-time*. This allows for a more personalized and responsive classification experience.
