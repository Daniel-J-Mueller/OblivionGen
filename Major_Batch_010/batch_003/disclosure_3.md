## Adaptive Schema Evolution for Secondary Indexes

**Concept:** Extend the conditional update mechanism to proactively manage schema changes in secondary indexes, not just data updates. This allows for seamless adaptation to evolving data models without downtime or complex migrations.

**Specifications:**

**1. Schema Versioning:**

*   Each secondary index will maintain a schema version identifier, separate from data versioning.
*   Schema changes (adding/removing fields, changing data types) will increment the schema version.
*   The primary data store will broadcast schema changes to registered secondary indexes.

**2. Conditional Schema Application:**

*   When a secondary index receives a schema change notification, it evaluates the compatibility of the new schema with its current state.
*   Compatibility evaluation will use a predefined ruleset (e.g., additive changes are always compatible, type changes require data conversion, field deletions require data re-projection).
*   If compatible, the schema is applied immediately.
*   If *not* compatible, a "schema migration session" is initiated.

**3. Schema Migration Session:**

*   A dedicated process (migration node) is spun up.
*   The migration node reads data from the primary data store based on the new schema.
*   A compatibility function determines how to transform the old data into the new schema (e.g., default values for missing fields, type conversions).
*   Transformed data is written to the secondary index.
*   Data versioning is crucial during the migration to ensure consistency.
*   If a migration fails, the secondary index rolls back to its previous schema and version.

**4.  Metadata for Schema Transformations:**

*   Store metadata alongside schema definitions about how to handle transformations (e.g., default values, conversion functions).
*   This metadata will be used by the migration node to automatically apply necessary transformations.

**5.  Pseudocode - Migration Node:**

```pseudocode
function migrate_secondary_index(secondary_index_id, new_schema):
  old_schema = get_secondary_index_schema(secondary_index_id)
  migration_plan = create_migration_plan(old_schema, new_schema)
  
  # For each transformation in the plan
  for transformation in migration_plan:
    
    # Read data from primary data store that needs transformation
    data_to_transform = read_data_from_primary(transformation.data_filter)
    
    # Apply transformation function
    transformed_data = apply_transformation(transformation.function, data_to_transform)
    
    # Write transformed data to secondary index
    write_data_to_secondary(transformed_data)
    
  # Update secondary index schema
  update_secondary_index_schema(secondary_index_id, new_schema)
  
  return success
```

**6.  Integration with Conditional Updates:**

*   Schema updates are treated as a special type of update, subject to the same conditional versioning logic.
*   This ensures that schema changes are applied in the correct order and are consistent with data updates.
*   A schema version identifier is attached to each update.
*   Secondary indexes will compare the requested schema version with their current schema version before applying the update.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Zero-downtime schema evolution:**  Secondary indexes can adapt to schema changes without requiring downtime.
*   **Increased flexibility:**  The system can support more dynamic and evolving data models.
*   **Reduced complexity:**  Automated schema migration simplifies the process of managing schema changes.
*   **Improved data consistency:**  Conditional updates and schema migrations ensure that data is consistent across all systems.
