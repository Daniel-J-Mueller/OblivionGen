## Adaptive Authority Shifting

**Concept:** Extend the authoritative server model by dynamically shifting authority over specific application entities (users, objects, etc.) *during* a session based on predictive latency and computational load. This isn’t a static assignment at session start, but a fluid reassignment.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Latency Prediction Module:** Continuously monitors round-trip latency between each client and *all* available servers.  Uses a Kalman filter or similar algorithm to predict future latency based on historical data.
*   **Load Balancing Module:** Monitors CPU/GPU/Memory utilization on each server.  Prioritizes servers with available capacity.
*   **Authority Shifting Manager (ASM):** The central control unit.  Receives latency and load data.  Makes decisions about authority reassignment.
*   **State Transfer Protocol (STP):**  A robust, efficient protocol for transferring application state between servers. Optimized for partial state transfers (only the changed data).

**II. Operation:**

1.  **Initial Authority:**  At session start, authority is assigned as in the provided patent – one server per client.
2.  **Continuous Monitoring:** The Latency Prediction Module and Load Balancing Module constantly monitor network conditions and server load.
3.  **Reassignment Trigger:** The ASM evaluates reassignment triggers based on a configurable policy.  Examples:
    *   **Latency Threshold Exceeded:** If predicted latency to the authoritative server exceeds a threshold for a specific client, reassignment is considered.
    *   **Server Overload:** If the authoritative server’s load exceeds a threshold, reassignment is considered.
    *   **Proactive Shift:** Predicts increasing latency or load and proactively shifts authority *before* it impacts the user.
4.  **Candidate Server Selection:** The ASM identifies a candidate server based on:
    *   **Lowest Predicted Latency:** To the client.
    *   **Lowest Current Load:**
    *   **Geographical Proximity:** (Optional) – To improve latency.
5.  **State Transfer:**  The ASM initiates a state transfer via the STP.  This includes:
    *   A full or partial snapshot of the application entity’s state.
    *   A list of pending events.
    *   A confirmation signal to the client about the authority change.
6.  **Client Update:** The client updates its internal representation of the authoritative server.
7.  **Event Redirection:** All subsequent events from the client are routed to the new authoritative server.
8.  **ASM Re-evaluation:** The ASM continuously re-evaluates the authority assignments and triggers reassignment if necessary.

**III. Pseudocode (ASM – Core Logic):**

```pseudocode
function evaluate_authority(client_id):
  latency = get_predicted_latency(client_id)
  load = get_server_load(current_authority_server(client_id))

  if latency > LATENCY_THRESHOLD or load > LOAD_THRESHOLD:
    candidate_servers = find_candidate_servers(client_id)
    best_server = select_best_server(candidate_servers)

    if best_server != current_authority_server(client_id):
      transfer_state(client_id, best_server)
      update_authority(client_id, best_server)
      log_authority_shift(client_id, best_server)
```

**IV. Considerations:**

*   **State Transfer Optimization:** Minimize the amount of data transferred during reassignment. Use compression, delta encoding, and partial state transfers.
*   **Event Handling During Transfer:** Ensure that events are not lost or duplicated during the authority shift. Use a sequence number or timestamp to track events.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain consistency of the application state across all servers. Implement a consensus algorithm or other synchronization mechanism.
*   **Security:** Protect the state transfer process from unauthorized access. Use encryption and authentication.
