## Dynamic Resource Prioritization & Workflow Sharding

**Concept:** Extend the resource-dependent workflow management to dynamically prioritize workflows based on real-time system load *and* user-defined importance, coupled with a method of ‘sharding’ larger workflows into smaller, independently executable components.

**Rationale:** The provided patent focuses on requesting resources and pausing/resuming workflows. This is reactive. This system proactively manages resources *before* conflicts arise, and allows for graceful degradation/prioritization during peak load. Sharding allows for partial completion of critical tasks even when full workflow completion is impossible.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Workflow Definition Enhancement:**
    *   Each workflow stage must include a ‘Priority’ value (integer, 1-10, 10 being highest).
    *   Each workflow stage must define dependencies (required resources, prior stage completion).
    *   Each workflow must be able to be broken down into *independent* stages or ‘shards’. These shards must be able to run concurrently if resources are available. The workflow definition language must facilitate shard definition.

2.  **Real-Time Resource Monitoring & Prediction:**
    *   Implement a system monitor collecting data on CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network bandwidth, and GPU load (if applicable).
    *   Utilize a predictive algorithm (linear regression, time series analysis) to forecast resource availability over a short time horizon (e.g., next 5-10 seconds).

3.  **Dynamic Priority Scheduler:**
    *   The core of the system.  Receives workflow requests and resource availability data.
    *   Calculates a “Workflow Score” for each pending/running workflow based on:
        *   Workflow Priority (defined in workflow definition)
        *   Resource Requirements of current stage
        *   Predicted resource availability
        *   User-defined importance (allows administrators or users to temporarily boost priority)
    *   Prioritizes workflows with the highest Workflow Score.

4.  **Workflow Sharding Engine:**
    *   If a workflow's resource requirements cannot be met for a given stage, the Sharding Engine automatically attempts to break the stage into smaller, independent shards.
    *   Shards are submitted to the Dynamic Priority Scheduler as independent tasks.
    *   The Sharding Engine manages the reassembly of shard results into the final workflow output.

5.  **Resource ‘Negotiation’ with ‘Soft Reservations’:**
    *   Instead of hard resource requests, the system will ‘negotiate’ resources. A workflow doesn’t *demand* resources; it *suggests* requirements and willingness to accept a scaled-down allocation.
    *   Implement ‘Soft Reservations’ - a workflow expresses its resource needs, and the system attempts to fulfill them. If resources are limited, the workflow can be offered a reduced allocation (e.g., lower CPU cores, reduced memory) in exchange for continued execution.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Priority Scheduler):**

```
function schedule_workflows(workflows, resource_monitor_data):
  for workflow in workflows:
    workflow_score = calculate_workflow_score(workflow, resource_monitor_data)
    sorted_workflows = sort_workflows_by_score(workflows)

  for workflow in sorted_workflows:
    if workflow.current_stage.resource_requirements <= available_resources:
      execute_workflow_stage(workflow.current_stage)
      update_workflow_state(workflow)
    else:
      shard_stage = shard_workflow_stage(workflow.current_stage)
      if shard_stage:
        for shard in shard_stage:
          if shard.resource_requirements <= available_resources:
            execute_shard(shard)
            update_workflow_state(workflow)

```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard server hardware with multi-core processors, sufficient RAM, and high-speed storage.
*   Network connectivity for communication between workflow control devices and resource control devices.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Operating System: Linux or Windows Server
*   Programming Languages: Python, C++, Java
*   Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL for storing workflow definitions and execution data.
*   Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow or PyTorch for predictive resource monitoring.
