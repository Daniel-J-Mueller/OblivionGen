## Adaptive Content Sharding with Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the redirection capabilities of the patent by proactively *sharding* content based on predicted attack vectors and dynamically balancing load *before* an attack fully manifests. This shifts from reactive mitigation to proactive resilience.

**Specs:**

**1. Content Profiler Module:**

*   **Input:** All incoming content (images, videos, text, application code) delivered to the CDN.
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze content metadata (file type, size, encoding, origin server).
    *   Employ machine learning models (trained on historical attack data) to *predict* potential attack surface. Examples: large video files are often DDoS targets, dynamic web content is susceptible to injection attacks.
    *   Assign a 'risk score' and ‘sharding profile’ to each content item. Sharding profile dictates how content should be fragmented and distributed.
*   **Output:** Content item with attached metadata including risk score and sharding profile.

**2. Dynamic Sharding Engine:**

*   **Input:** Content item with metadata, configuration parameters (maximum shard size, redundancy level).
*   **Process:**
    *   Fragment content into multiple shards based on the sharding profile.
    *   Distribute shards across geographically diverse CDN edge nodes.
    *   Generate a 'shard map' – a lookup table mapping each shard to its location(s).
    *   Implement erasure coding to provide redundancy and resilience against node failures.
*   **Output:** Sharded content distributed across CDN, shard map.

**3. Predictive Load Balancer:**

*   **Input:** Real-time traffic data, shard map, historical attack data, content risk scores.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ time-series forecasting models to predict traffic patterns and potential attack vectors.
    *   Proactively shift traffic to less congested edge nodes and/or alternative content sources.
    *   Dynamically adjust the number of replicas for each shard based on predicted demand.
    *   Monitor for anomalous traffic patterns (e.g., sudden spikes in requests from a single IP range).
    *   Implement rate limiting and traffic shaping to mitigate potential attacks.
*   **Output:** Real-time traffic routing adjustments, shard replica adjustments.

**4. Attack Signature Adaption Module:**

*   **Input:** Detected attack patterns, content characteristics, predictive load balancer data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze detected attack vectors.
    *   Generate custom attack signatures optimized for the specific content and CDN configuration.
    *   Distribute signatures to edge nodes for real-time detection and mitigation.
*   **Output:** Updated attack signatures.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Load Balancer - simplified):**

```
function predict_traffic(historical_data, current_time):
  // Time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM)
  predicted_traffic = model.predict(historical_data, current_time)
  return predicted_traffic

function adjust_load(predicted_traffic, shard_map, node_capacities):
  // Identify nodes nearing capacity
  overloaded_nodes = find_overloaded_nodes(predicted_traffic, node_capacities)

  // Shift traffic from overloaded nodes to underutilized nodes
  for each shard in shards:
    if shard located on overloaded_node:
      find_underutilized_node(node_capacities)
      replicate_shard_to_underutilized_node(shard)

  return updated_shard_map
```

**Core Innovation:** Proactive, AI-driven content sharding and load balancing that anticipates and mitigates attacks *before* they fully materialize, moving beyond reactive redirection strategies. This creates a self-healing CDN capable of sustaining high availability and performance even under extreme attack conditions.
