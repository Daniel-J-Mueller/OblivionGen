## Dynamic Contextual Anchor Propagation

**Concept:** Expand the "marked location anchor" concept to include *propagation* of contextual relevance across multiple networked information sources, not just within a single "network site". This creates a dynamically updated knowledge graph visualized as branching anchors.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Sources:**

*   **Core Sources:** Existing web pages, files, network locations as defined in the base patent.
*   **External Sources:** APIs for news feeds, social media streams, scientific databases (e.g., PubMed), semantic web data (e.g., Wikidata), and other relevant data services.
*   **User-Defined Sources:** Ability for users to add custom data sources (e.g., RSS feeds, internal databases) via URL or API key.

**2. Contextual Analysis Engine:**

*   **NLP/NLU Module:** Processes text content from all data sources, identifying key entities, relationships, and sentiment.
*   **Knowledge Graph Construction:** Builds a knowledge graph representing entities and their connections, weighted by relevance scores derived from NLP analysis and user interaction.
*   **Relevance Scoring:**  Calculates a relevance score for each data source and individual content item based on:
    *   Semantic similarity to the initial “marked location”.
    *   Co-occurrence of entities.
    *   User engagement (clicks, time spent, annotations).
    *   Source authority/trustworthiness (determined by a reputation system).

**3. Dynamic Anchor Propagation Algorithm:**

*   **Initial Anchor:** Begins with a user-defined “marked location”.
*   **Branch Creation:**  The algorithm identifies content from connected data sources (based on relevance scores) and creates "branches" extending from the initial anchor.
*   **Branch Weighting:** Branches are weighted based on the relevance score of the associated content.
*   **Dynamic Update:**  The algorithm continuously monitors data sources for new or updated content. Branches are dynamically added, removed, or re-weighted based on changes in relevance.
*   **Decay Mechanism:** Older or less relevant branches gradually decay in prominence to prevent information overload.

**4. User Interface:**

*   **Anchor Visualization:** Displays anchors as nodes in a graph. Branch thickness/color indicates relevance.
*   **Interactive Exploration:** Users can:
    *   Expand/collapse branches.
    *   Filter branches by source or keyword.
    *   Annotate branches with notes or tags.
    *   Adjust relevance thresholds.
*   **Contextual Preview:** Hovering over a branch displays a snippet of the associated content.
*   **Source Control:**  Users can add/remove data sources and configure relevance settings.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
markedLocation = user.selectLocation()
knowledgeGraph = new KnowledgeGraph()
dataSources = user.configuredSources()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  for each dataSource in dataSources {
    content = dataSource.fetchNewContent()
    for each item in content {
      relevanceScore = calculateRelevance(item, markedLocation, knowledgeGraph)
      if (relevanceScore > threshold) {
        knowledgeGraph.addNode(item, markedLocation, relevanceScore)
      }
    }
  }
  // Decay old nodes
  knowledgeGraph.decayNodes()
  // Update UI with current state of knowledge graph
  renderUI(knowledgeGraph)
  sleep(interval)
}

function calculateRelevance(content, markedLocation, knowledgeGraph) {
  // Combine semantic similarity, co-occurrence, and source authority
  semanticSimilarity = calculateSemanticSimilarity(content, markedLocation)
  coOccurrence = calculateCoOccurrence(content, knowledgeGraph)
  sourceAuthority = getSourceAuthority(content.source)
  relevance = (semanticSimilarity * weight1) + (coOccurrence * weight2) + (sourceAuthority * weight3)
  return relevance
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Personalized Knowledge Management:**  Create dynamic knowledge bases tailored to individual interests.
*   **Competitive Intelligence:** Track trends and insights related to specific companies or industries.
*   **Research and Discovery:**  Explore connections between disparate fields of knowledge.
*   **Real-Time Situational Awareness:** Monitor events and information relevant to specific situations.
