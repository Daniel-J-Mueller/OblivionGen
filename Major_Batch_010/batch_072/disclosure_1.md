## Dynamic Mesh Network Predictive Hand-off

**Concept:** Expand the peer-assist functionality into a proactive, self-healing mesh network, predicting connectivity loss *before* it happens and dynamically routing traffic through available peers to maintain a seamless connection. The existing patent focuses on reacting to a dropped connection. This moves to *anticipation* and proactive mitigation.

**Specs:**

*   **Node Designation:** Each device on the network is designated as a ‘Node’ with unique identifier. Nodes continuously broadcast ‘Health Signals’ including:
    *   Signal strength to Access Point (AP).
    *   Signal strength to neighboring Nodes (detected via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beaconing or Wi-Fi Direct).
    *   Current bandwidth utilization.
    *   Latency to a central server (ping).
    *   Predicted AP disconnection probability (calculated from signal degradation rate, historical data, and server-side analytics).
*   **Central Coordinator:** A central server (or distributed algorithm) acts as a Coordinator. It collects Health Signals from all Nodes and builds a network topology map.
*   **Predictive Routing Algorithm:** The Coordinator utilizes a modified Dijkstra's Algorithm (or similar) to calculate optimal routes for data transmission. This algorithm *weights* connections based on predicted reliability (AP disconnection probability) *and* latency.
*   **Proactive Hand-off:** When the algorithm predicts a high probability of disconnection for a Node, it *proactively* begins routing new traffic through alternative, reliable Nodes. This happens *before* the disconnection occurs.
*   **Session Persistence:**  The system maintains session information (e.g., active video calls, file transfers) and transparently migrates these sessions to the new route.
*   **Dynamic Topology Adjustment:**  Nodes continuously update their Health Signals, allowing the Coordinator to dynamically adjust the network topology in real-time.
*   **Protocol:** Utilize a lightweight messaging protocol (e.g., MQTT, CoAP) for exchanging Health Signals and routing instructions.

**Pseudocode (Coordinator):**

```
// Data Structures
NetworkTopology: Graph data structure representing the network
NodeHealth: Dictionary storing health data for each node
RoutingTable: Dictionary storing optimal routes for each destination

// Initialization
Initialize NetworkTopology and NodeHealth
Update RoutingTable based on initial network state

// Main Loop
while (true):
    // 1. Receive Health Signals from Nodes
    For Each Node:
        Receive HealthSignal
        Update NodeHealth[Node]
        Update NetworkTopology (edge weights based on signal strength, predicted disconnection probability)

    // 2. Predictive Analysis
    For Each Node:
        Calculate predicted disconnection probability
        If (predicted disconnection probability > threshold):
            // 3. Route Diversion
            Calculate alternative route through reliable nodes
            Update RoutingTable for affected sessions
            Redirect traffic

    // 4. Topology Maintenance
    Remove disconnected nodes from NetworkTopology
    Add newly connected nodes
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   All nodes must be equipped with BLE or Wi-Fi Direct for proximity detection and direct communication.
*   Nodes require sufficient processing power to handle routing calculations and traffic redirection.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Seamless handover for video conferencing in areas with unreliable Wi-Fi.
*   Robust connectivity for IoT devices in challenging environments.
*   Improved resilience for mobile gaming and AR/VR applications.
