## Adaptive Key-Value Hierarchy with Temporal Policies

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the hierarchical key-value store concept with *temporal* policies, allowing access permissions and even structural definitions to change over time. This moves beyond static policies associated with a directory/namespace and introduces a time-dimension to authorization and organization.

**II. Data Structures:**

*   **Temporal Policy Record:**
    *   `policy_id`: Unique identifier for the policy.
    *   `start_time`: Timestamp indicating when the policy becomes active.
    *   `end_time`: Timestamp indicating when the policy expires.  (Can be indefinite).
    *   `access_rules`: Standard access control list (ACL) defining allowed operations (read, write, execute, etc.) for users/groups.
    *   `structure_definition`: Optional.  Defines changes to the hierarchical structure – adding/removing "directories" or re-assigning objects to different hierarchies.  Stored as a diff against a base structure.
    *   `policy_source`: Indicates origin (system administrator, user-defined, automated rule).

*   **Key-Value Store Modification:** Each "directory" (represented by a redirecting key-value pair in the original patent) now has an associated list of `policy_id`s – a “policy timeline”.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Request Arrival:**  A request arrives to access an object within a specific namespace/hierarchy.

2.  **Policy Timeline Retrieval:** The system retrieves the policy timeline associated with the "directory" containing the requested object.

3.  **Time-Based Policy Selection:** The system determines the active policy(ies) at the current timestamp.  This involves iterating through the `policy_timeline`, filtering for policies where `current_time >= start_time` and `current_time <= end_time`. Multiple active policies are possible; these are evaluated in order of precedence (e.g., more specific policies override general ones).

4.  **Policy Evaluation:**  The selected policy is used to determine authorization. If the requestor meets the `access_rules` criteria, access is granted.

5.  **Structure Application:** If the selected policy includes a `structure_definition`, the system *dynamically* applies the structural changes before proceeding with the request.  This may involve modifying the routing of requests or the visibility of objects.

6.  **Request Processing:**  The request is processed as normal, respecting the applied policy and structure.

**IV. Pseudocode (Policy Resolution):**

```pseudocode
function resolve_policy(namespace, current_time):
  policy_timeline = get_policy_timeline(namespace)
  active_policies = []
  for policy in policy_timeline:
    if current_time >= policy.start_time and current_time <= policy.end_time:
      active_policies.append(policy)

  #Sort by specificity (e.g., user-specific > group-specific > general)
  active_policies.sort(key=lambda p: p.specificity)

  if active_policies:
    return active_policies[0]  #Return the most specific active policy
  else:
    return default_policy  #Return a default policy if no active policies are found
```

**V. Implementation Details:**

*   **Policy Storage:**  Policies can be stored in a dedicated database or as key-value pairs themselves.
*   **Caching:**  Active policies should be cached to minimize latency.
*   **Time Synchronization:**  Accurate time synchronization is crucial for correct policy evaluation.
*   **Version Control:** Implement version control for policies to enable rollback and auditing.
*   **Automated Policy Generation:**  Integrate with automation tools to generate policies based on predefined rules or events. (e.g., automatically grant temporary access to a shared resource based on user role and project deadline).
