## Dynamic Predictive Capacity Shifting with Resource ‘Shadowing’

**Concept:** Enhance traffic surge mitigation by not just reacting to current load, but *predicting* capacity needs and proactively shifting resource allocations *before* a surge impacts performance. This is achieved through ‘resource shadowing’ – temporarily duplicating critical services across multiple POPs based on predictive modeling, and dynamically adjusting routing based on real-time observation.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive Modeling Engine:**

*   **Input Data:** Historical request patterns (time of day, day of week, event-based spikes), real-time request rates per target group/resource, geographical distribution of requests, external event feeds (news, social media – for anticipated surges), capacity data from each POP (CPU, memory, bandwidth).
*   **Model Type:** Time-series forecasting (e.g., Prophet, LSTM networks) trained on historical data to predict future request rates for each target group/resource.  Include anomaly detection to identify unexpected traffic patterns *before* they escalate.
*   **Output:**  Probability distribution of expected request volume for each target group/resource, for specified time horizons (e.g., next 5, 15, 30 minutes).  Risk score indicating the likelihood of a surge exceeding current capacity.

**2. Resource Shadowing Mechanism:**

*   **Shadow Instances:** For critical services (databases, application servers, caching layers), automatically create ‘shadow’ instances on secondary POPs when the predictive model indicates a high surge risk. These instances are kept minimally active (e.g., caching warm data) but ready to handle traffic.
*   **Shadow Activation Threshold:** Define a threshold based on the predicted surge magnitude and spare capacity at the primary POP.  If predicted load exceeds this threshold, the shadow instances are scaled up to full capacity.
*   **Shadow Deactivation:**  When the surge subsides, or the predictive model indicates a low risk, shadow instances are scaled down or deactivated to conserve resources.

**3. Dynamic Routing & Load Balancing:**

*   **GeoDNS & Anycast Integration:** Utilize GeoDNS and Anycast to route requests to the POP with the most available capacity, considering both primary and shadow instances.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the performance of all POPs (latency, error rates, CPU utilization).
*   **Adaptive Weighting:** Adjust routing weights dynamically based on real-time performance metrics.  If a POP is becoming overloaded, reduce its weight and shift traffic to underutilized POPs.
*   **Circuit Breaker Implementation:** Implement circuit breakers to isolate failing POPs and prevent cascading failures.

**4.  Feedback Loop & Model Retraining:**

*   **Performance Data Collection:** Collect detailed performance data (request rates, latency, error rates) for each POP during and after surge events.
*   **Model Retraining:**  Periodically retrain the predictive model using the collected performance data to improve its accuracy. Incorporate A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of different model configurations.



**Pseudocode (Simplified – Dynamic Routing Logic):**

```
function routeRequest(request, targetGroup):
  popList = getAvailablePOPs(targetGroup) // Returns list of POPs with capacity data
  
  // Calculate routing weights based on capacity, latency, and shadow instance status
  for pop in popList:
    weight = pop.capacity * (1 - pop.latencyScore) + (pop.shadowInstanceStatus ? 0.2 : 0)
    totalWeight += weight
    
  // Select a POP based on weighted random selection
  randomNumber = random() * totalWeight
  cumulativeWeight = 0
  for pop in popList:
    cumulativeWeight += pop.weight
    if randomNumber <= cumulativeWeight:
      return pop
```

This system anticipates traffic surges rather than reacting to them. Resource Shadowing ensures capacity is prepared *before* demand spikes, maximizing resilience and minimizing user impact. The dynamic routing engine intelligently distributes traffic across available resources, optimizing performance and preventing overload.
