## Adaptive Mesh Density & Biometric Integration

**Concept:** Expand tamper detection beyond simple circuit breaks to include localized mesh stress analysis combined with biometric authentication of authorized personnel accessing the rack. This aims to distinguish between malicious tampering and legitimate, authorized access/maintenance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Mesh Fabrication:**

*   **Material:** Employ a woven mesh comprised of both conductive and non-conductive fibers. Conductive fibers will form the primary tamper detection network (similar to the base patent), while non-conductive fibers provide structural integrity & variable density zones.
*   **Variable Density:** The mesh will *not* be uniform. Key zones, particularly around access points (cable management, server rails), will have significantly higher fiber density. This increases sensitivity to localized stress changes.
*   **Fiber Types:** Utilize piezoelectric fibers interwoven with conductive fibers. Piezoelectric fibers generate a small voltage when mechanically stressed, providing an additional tamper indication *before* a full circuit break.

**2. Sensor Network:**

*   **Micro-Strain Gauges:** Integrate micro-strain gauges *within* the mesh at high-density zones. These gauges detect minute deformations of the mesh, registering localized pressure or pulling.
*   **Capacitive Sensors:** Interweave capacitive sensors throughout the mesh. Changes in capacitance indicate physical proximity or manipulation of the mesh.
*   **Sensor Nodes:** Each sensor (strain gauge, capacitive sensor, piezoelectric fiber output) connects to a miniature, wireless sensor node embedded within the mesh structure. These nodes communicate via a low-power mesh network.
*   **Edge Processing:** A central edge processing unit (mounted to the rack) collects data from all sensor nodes. This unit performs initial data filtering and anomaly detection.

**3. Biometric Integration & Access Control:**

*   **RFID/NFC Authentication:** Integrate RFID or NFC readers into the rack frame at designated access points. Authorized personnel use tagged credentials.
*   **Biometric Scanner:** Include a biometric scanner (fingerprint, palm vein, facial recognition) at each access point. This provides multi-factor authentication.
*   **Access Log & Correlation:** The system logs all access attempts (RFID/NFC & biometric). It correlates access events with sensor data. Legitimate access will be accompanied by corresponding sensor activity (e.g., expected pressure on the mesh).
*   **Adaptive Sensitivity:** The system adapts its sensitivity based on authorized access events. It learns the 'normal' stress patterns during legitimate maintenance and adjusts the tamper threshold accordingly.

**4. Alerting System:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** The edge processing unit continuously monitors sensor data and access logs.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Algorithms detect anomalies: unexpected stress patterns, unauthorized access attempts, or discrepancies between access logs and sensor data.
*   **Multi-Tiered Alerts:**
    *   **Tier 1 (Warning):** Unusual sensor activity detected. Increased monitoring.
    *   **Tier 2 (Alert):** Potential tampering detected. Notification to security personnel.
    *   **Tier 3 (Critical):** Confirmed tampering. System lockdown.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detectAnomaly(sensorData, accessLog):
  // Sensor data: array of strain/capacitance readings
  // Access Log: record of authorized/unauthorized access attempts

  expectedStress = calculateExpectedStress(accessLog) // Based on authorized activities
  stressDeviation = calculateStressDeviation(sensorData, expectedStress)

  if stressDeviation > threshold AND accessLog.unauthorizedAttempt == TRUE:
    return "Tampering Detected - Critical"
  elif stressDeviation > threshold:
    return "Potential Tampering - Alert"
  elif stressDeviation > minorThreshold:
    return "Unusual Activity - Warning"
  else:
    return "Normal"
```
