## Adaptive Content Fingerprinting with Stylometric Analysis

**Concept:** Expand on the hash-based duplicate detection by incorporating stylometric analysis to identify content *similarity* beyond verbatim copying. This moves beyond simple duplication detection to assess potential paraphrasing, stylistic borrowing, or even AI-generated content with similar thematic and stylistic signatures.

**Specs:**

*   **Module 1: Stylometric Feature Extraction:**
    *   Input: Digital content (text).
    *   Process:
        1.  Tokenization & Preprocessing: Standard text cleaning (remove punctuation, lowercase).
        2.  Feature Calculation: Compute a range of stylometric features:
            *   Lexical Diversity: Type-Token Ratio (TTR), Honoreâ€™s Statistic.
            *   Sentence Structure: Average sentence length, sentence complexity (number of clauses).
            *   Word Choice: Frequency distribution of function words (articles, prepositions), vocabulary richness.  Use established frequency lists (e.g., Brown Corpus).
            *   Readability Scores: Flesch Reading Ease, Gunning Fog Index.
            *   N-gram analysis: Frequency of character and word N-grams.
    *   Output: Stylometric Feature Vector (a numerical representation of the content's style).

*   **Module 2: Dynamic Fingerprint Generation:**
    *   Input: Digital content, Stylometric Feature Vector.
    *   Process:
        1.  Hash Generation: Generate traditional hash codes from N-grams of the text (as in the provided patent).
        2.  Feature-Weighted Hashing:  Assign weights to the hash codes based on the corresponding stylometric features.  Higher weights for features indicating a strong stylistic signature.
            *   Example: If a document has a very high Type-Token Ratio (indicating a diverse vocabulary), the hash codes generated from less common words receive higher weights.
        3.  Fingerprint Construction: Combine weighted hash codes and the stylometric feature vector into a comprehensive fingerprint.

*   **Module 3: Similarity Comparison:**
    *   Input: Fingerprint of source content, Fingerprint of candidate content.
    *   Process:
        1.  Feature Space Mapping: Map both fingerprints into a multi-dimensional feature space.
        2.  Distance Calculation: Calculate a distance metric (e.g., Cosine Similarity, Euclidean Distance) between the fingerprints.  Different weights can be applied to different features in the distance calculation.
        3.  Similarity Scoring: Generate a similarity score based on the distance.  Thresholds can be adjusted to control sensitivity.

*   **Module 4: Adaptive Thresholding & Learning:**
    *   Process:
        1.  Monitor Similarity Scores: Track similarity scores across a large corpus of content.
        2.  Dynamic Threshold Adjustment: Automatically adjust similarity thresholds based on the distribution of scores.  This helps to minimize false positives and false negatives.
        3.  Machine Learning Integration: Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., supervised learning) to train a model that can predict the likelihood of duplicate or similar content.  Features used for training include: similarity score, stylometric features, source metadata.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generate_fingerprint(content):
  stylometric_features = extract_stylometric_features(content)
  hash_codes = generate_hash_codes(content)
  weighted_hash_codes = weight_hash_codes(hash_codes, stylometric_features)
  fingerprint = combine(weighted_hash_codes, stylometric_features)
  return fingerprint

function compare_fingerprints(fingerprint1, fingerprint2):
  distance = calculate_distance(fingerprint1, fingerprint2)
  similarity_score = calculate_similarity_score(distance)
  return similarity_score
```
