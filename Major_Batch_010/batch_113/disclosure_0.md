## Automated Fault Prediction & Pre-emptive Mitigation

**Concept:** Extend the automated fault injection system to *predict* faults before they manifest, and proactively mitigate them by dynamically adjusting system resources or activating redundancy.

**Specs:**

**1. Prediction Module:**

*   **Data Source:** Integrate a real-time telemetry stream from the virtual compute instance (CPU usage, memory pressure, I/O latency, network bandwidth, error logs, etc.).
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement a machine learning model (e.g., time-series forecasting, autoencoders, isolation forests) trained on historical telemetry data to identify anomalous patterns indicating potential faults.
*   **Fault Correlation:** Develop a knowledge base mapping anomalous telemetry patterns to specific fault types (e.g., high CPU usage + increasing I/O latency -> potential disk contention).
*   **Prediction Confidence:** Assign a confidence score to each fault prediction based on the strength of the anomalous patterns and the accuracy of the fault correlation.
*   **Thresholding:** Configure adjustable thresholds for prediction confidence to trigger mitigation actions.

**2. Mitigation Engine:**

*   **Resource Adjustment:** Dynamically scale resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) allocated to the virtual compute instance based on the predicted fault and its severity.
*   **Redundancy Activation:** Automatically activate redundant resources (e.g., failover servers, replicated databases) to take over critical functions in the event of a predicted fault.
*   **Traffic Shifting:** Redirect traffic away from the potentially affected virtual compute instance to healthy instances.
*   **Adaptive Fault Injection:** Based on the predicted fault, *pre-emptively* inject a *less severe* version of the fault to test mitigation strategies in a controlled environment before the actual fault occurs. This is a self-testing loop.
*   **Mitigation Logging:**  Record all mitigation actions taken, along with the predicted fault, confidence score, and outcome.

**3. Integration with Existing System:**

*   **API Extension:** Add new API endpoints to allow external systems to query fault predictions and trigger mitigation actions.
*   **Fault Injection Orchestration:** Modify the existing fault injection system to incorporate the prediction module and mitigation engine. The fault injection system becomes a closed-loop system.
*   **Telemetry Integration:** Integrate with existing telemetry collection systems to provide the prediction module with real-time data.
*   **Alerting:** Generate alerts based on fault predictions and mitigation actions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Prediction Module
function predictFault(telemetryData) {
    anomalyScore = detectAnomaly(telemetryData);
    if (anomalyScore > threshold) {
        predictedFault = correlateAnomaly(anomalyScore);
        confidence = calculateConfidence(predictedFault);
        return { fault: predictedFault, confidence: confidence };
    }
    return null;
}

// Mitigation Engine
function mitigateFault(predictedFault, confidence) {
    if (predictedFault == "DiskContention") {
        scaleDiskIO(virtualComputeInstance, factor);
    } else if (predictedFault == "MemoryLeak") {
        activateRedundantServer(virtualComputeInstance);
    } else {
        //Default mitigation
        scaleResources(virtualComputeInstance, factor);
    }
    logMitigation(predictedFault, confidence);
}

//Main Loop
while (true) {
    telemetryData = collectTelemetry();
    prediction = predictFault(telemetryData);
    if (prediction != null && prediction.confidence > threshold) {
        mitigateFault(prediction.fault, prediction.confidence);
    }
}
```

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond reactive fault testing to *proactive* fault prevention. Instead of simply injecting faults to observe system behavior, it attempts to predict faults *before* they happen and take steps to mitigate them. The adaptive fault injection loop is a self-testing paradigm.
