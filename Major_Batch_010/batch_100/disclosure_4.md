## Adaptive Monitor Synthesis & Predictive Scaling

**Core Concept:** Dynamically generate synthetic monitoring probes beyond pre-defined classes, and proactively scale monitoring granularity based on predictive system load *before* performance bottlenecks occur. This expands beyond simply *replacing* existing monitors, to *creating* new ones on-the-fly.

**System Components:**

1.  **Dynamic Probe Generator (DPG):**  A module capable of synthesizing monitoring probes (scripts, agents, configurations) based on abstract 'monitor profiles'. These profiles define *what* to monitor (e.g., 'inter-process communication latency'), but not *how*. The DPG leverages a library of 'probe primitives' – low-level functions for collecting specific data points (CPU usage, network packet counts, disk I/O, etc.).  The DPG uses a rules engine to combine these primitives into functional probes.

2.  **Anomaly Detection & Prediction Engine (ADPE):** This engine analyzes historical monitoring data and real-time system metrics to predict future load and potential performance issues.  It goes beyond simply flagging anomalies; it forecasts *where* bottlenecks will likely occur.  It leverages time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) and correlation analysis.

3.  **Monitor Profile Repository:**  A central store of abstract monitor profiles. Profiles include:
    *   *Monitoring Objective*: (e.g., 'Ensure low latency of critical database queries', 'Track resource contention in the message queue').
    *   *Target System Component*: (e.g., 'Database Server', 'Message Queue', 'Web Application Tier').
    *   *Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)*: (e.g., 'Query execution time', 'Message queue depth', 'Request response time').
    *   *Acceptable Performance Thresholds*.
    *   *Scaling Parameters*: Rules for adjusting monitoring granularity (e.g., sampling frequency, data retention period).

4.  **Automated Deployment & Orchestration:** This module automatically deploys synthesized monitors to the target systems and manages their lifecycle.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  The ADPE predicts an upcoming increase in load on the 'Database Server', specifically anticipating high contention on a frequently accessed table.
2.  The ADPE identifies a relevant monitor profile – 'Database Table Access Latency'.
3.  The DPG synthesizes a new monitoring probe based on the 'Database Table Access Latency' profile. This probe might involve creating a custom SQL query to measure the execution time of the target query, or installing a database performance tracing agent.
4.  The Automated Deployment & Orchestration module deploys the synthesized probe to the Database Server.
5.  The probe collects data and sends it to the central monitoring system.
6.  If the ADPE predicts a decrease in load, it can automatically reduce the granularity of the monitoring probes, or even remove them altogether.
7.  The system also automatically flags probes which have low or non-existent data, potentially due to an issue with the system or the monitoring probe.

**Pseudocode (DPG - Probe Synthesis):**

```
function synthesize_probe(monitor_profile):
    probe_code = ""
    for metric in monitor_profile.metrics:
        primitive = get_primitive(metric.primitive_type, metric.parameters) //e.g. "CPU Usage", "Disk I/O", "Network Latency"
        if primitive is not null:
            probe_code += primitive.generate_code(metric.target, metric.sampling_rate) // Generate script or config snippet
        else:
            log_error("Primitive not found for metric: " + metric.name)
            return null

    return probe_code
```

**Novelty:**

This goes beyond simply *replacing* or *tuning* existing monitors. It actively *creates* new ones in response to predicted system behavior.  The combination of predictive scaling, automated probe synthesis, and a profile-driven approach allows for a far more adaptive and proactive monitoring system.  It's not just about detecting problems; it's about anticipating them and preparing for them *before* they occur.  It moves monitoring from a reactive to a predictive and proactive stance.
