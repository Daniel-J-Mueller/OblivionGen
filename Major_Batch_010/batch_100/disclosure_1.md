## Dynamic Cell Morphology & Haptic Feedback Integration

**Concept:** Extend the curved cell display concept by allowing cells to *morph* based on user gaze and hand proximity, coupled with localized haptic feedback delivered via the VR headset/controllers. This creates a more immersive and tactile interface beyond visual curvature.

**Specs:**

*   **Gaze Tracking Integration:** Integrate eye-tracking data to determine which cells the user is currently focusing on.
*   **Proximity Sensing:** Utilize hand-tracking data (or controller position) to determine the distance between the user's hand(s) and individual cells.
*   **Morphing Algorithm:** Implement an algorithm that dynamically alters cell shape (scale, rotation, slight 3D extrusion/indentation) based on *both* gaze and proximity. 
    *   Cells under direct gaze should exhibit a subtle ‘highlight’ morph – a gentle scaling up and brightening.
    *   As the user’s hand approaches a cell, its shape should subtly ‘respond’ – perhaps a slight indentation as if being ‘pressed’ or a smooth rounding of edges. The degree of morph should be inversely proportional to distance.
*   **Haptic Feedback System:** Coordinate haptic feedback with the morphing. 
    *   As a cell is ‘pressed’ (hand proximity), a localized vibration or pressure simulation should be delivered to the corresponding area of the VR headset or controller. The intensity should correlate with the degree of deformation.
    *   Gaze-activated highlight morphs could be accompanied by a very subtle ‘click’ or tonal shift delivered through bone-conducting headphones.
*   **Cell State Management:** Each cell will have an associated 'state' –  'idle', 'gazed', 'approached', 'selected'. The morphing and haptic feedback will be determined by the current state.
*   **Customization Options:** Allow users to adjust the sensitivity of the morphing and haptic feedback, as well as the types of feedback delivered.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Cell Update Loop):**

```
For each cell in cellArray:
    //Update state
    if (isCellWithinGaze(cell, gazeData)):
        cell.state = "gazed"
    else if (isCellWithinProximity(cell, handData)):
        cell.state = "approached"
    else:
        cell.state = "idle"

    //Calculate morph parameters
    morphScale = 1.0 //Default scale
    morphRotation = 0.0 //Default rotation

    if (cell.state == "gazed"):
        morphScale = 1.05 + (gazeIntensity * 0.05)
    elif (cell.state == "approached"):
        distance = calculateDistance(handPosition, cellPosition)
        morphScale = 1.0 - (distance * 0.1)
        //Limit morphScale to reasonable range

    //Apply morph to cell geometry
    applyMorph(cell, morphScale, morphRotation)

    //Trigger haptic feedback
    if (cell.state == "approached"):
        triggerHapticFeedback(cell, handProximityIntensity)
```

**Potential Benefits:** Increased immersion, improved usability, enhanced sense of presence, novel interaction paradigm.  Could be especially impactful for applications requiring fine motor control or detailed information exploration within VR.
