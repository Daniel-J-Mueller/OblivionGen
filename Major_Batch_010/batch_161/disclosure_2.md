## Adaptive Content Re-Rendering with Client-Side Encryption Keys

**Concept:** Leverage client-side cryptographic keys and adaptive rendering techniques to enable dynamic, personalized content modifications *before* encryption for delivery, optimizing for device capabilities and user preferences while maintaining robust security.

**Specs:**

**1. Key Exchange & Device Profiling:**

*   **Initial Setup:** Upon user registration/device activation, a unique asymmetric key pair (public/private) is generated server-side and securely provisioned to the user’s device (e.g., through a hardware security module). The public key is registered with the content service.
*   **Device Profiling:**  The device continuously transmits telemetry (bandwidth, screen resolution, processing power, supported codecs) to the content service. This data forms a dynamic ‘device profile’. 
*   **Key Refresh:** Implement periodic key rotation (e.g., monthly) with secure key exchange protocols.

**2. Adaptive Rendering Pipeline (Client-Side):**

*   **Content Request:** When a user requests content, the service identifies the device profile.
*   **Rendering Instructions:** The service generates a set of ‘rendering instructions’ tailored to the device. These instructions could include:
    *   Resolution scaling factors.
    *   Codec selection.
    *   Watermark insertion.
    *   Color correction.
    *   Subtitle/caption application.
    *   Region-specific redaction (e.g., based on geo-location).
    *   Dynamic Ad Insertion (DAI) – placement and duration.
*   **Instruction Encryption:** The rendering instructions are encrypted using the user's *public* key before transmission to the device.
*   **Local Rendering:** The device *decrypts* the rendering instructions using its private key.  The content is then rendered locally *before* encryption for transmission.

**3. Final Encryption & Delivery:**

*   **Content Encryption:** After rendering, the modified content is encrypted using a symmetric key (AES-256) generated *per content item* and associated with the content item’s identifier.
*   **Key Encryption:** The symmetric key is encrypted using the user’s public key.
*   **Delivery Package:**  The encrypted content, encrypted symmetric key, and content identifier are packaged and delivered to the device.
*   **Decryption:** The device decrypts the symmetric key using its private key and then uses the symmetric key to decrypt the content.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side - Decryption & Rendering):**

```
function ReceiveContentPackage(package) {
  // 1. Decrypt Symmetric Key
  symmetricKey = Decrypt(package.encryptedSymmetricKey, privateKey);

  // 2. Decrypt Content
  content = Decrypt(package.encryptedContent, symmetricKey);

  // 3. Decrypt Rendering Instructions
  renderingInstructions = Decrypt(package.encryptedRenderingInstructions, privateKey);

  // 4. Apply Rendering Instructions to Content
  renderedContent = ApplyRenderingInstructions(content, renderingInstructions);

  // 5. Return Rendered Content
  return renderedContent;
}

function ApplyRenderingInstructions(content, instructions) {
    //Iterate through the instructions and modify content accordingly
    // (resolution scaling, codec application, watermarking, etc.)
    //This is where the core rendering logic resides.
}
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Personalization:** Dynamic rendering enables content adaptation to individual user preferences and device capabilities.
*   **Improved Security:**  Client-side key management ensures that decryption only occurs on trusted devices.
*   **Reduced Bandwidth:** Rendering on the device can optimize content size and resolution for efficient delivery.
*   **Robust DRM:** The combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption provides strong DRM protection.
*   **Scalability:**  Rendering instructions can be generated and delivered efficiently at scale.
