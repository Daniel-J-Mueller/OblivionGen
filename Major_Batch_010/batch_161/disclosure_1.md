**Dynamic Per-Tile Quality Scaling with Predictive Buffering**

**Concept:** Extend the existing bitrate adaptation system to operate not just at the channel or segment level, but *per-tile* within a video frame, coupled with a predictive buffering system that anticipates bandwidth needs based on tile complexity.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Tile-Based Encoding:**
    *   Input video is divided into tiles (e.g., 32x32 or 64x64 pixel regions).
    *   Each tile is independently encoded at multiple quality levels (bitrates).  A rate control model determines appropriate settings, like in the source patent, but applies to each tile individually.
    *   Encoding profiles store the encoded tiles, associated metadata (tile ID, quality level, estimated bitrate, complexity score).

2.  **Complexity Analysis:**
    *   During encoding, a complexity metric is calculated for each tile.  This could include:
        *   Motion vector variance
        *   Texture/detail level (e.g., using a Laplacian variance filter)
        *   Scene change detection within the tile.
    *   Complexity score is stored alongside the encoded tile.

3.  **Real-time Tile Selection & Transmission:**
    *   Client device analyzes incoming viewership data.  (As per patent)
    *   Based on available bandwidth and predicted bandwidth, the client requests tiles.
    *   A *tile selector* module determines which quality level of each tile to transmit.
        *   Priority given to tiles with high complexity when bandwidth is constrained. This ensures visually important areas retain detail.
        *   When bandwidth is plentiful, higher quality tiles are requested across the board.
    *   The client requests specific tiles, not entire segments. This allows granular control and minimizes unnecessary data transfer.

4.  **Predictive Buffering:**
    *   Client maintains a buffer of pre-encoded tiles.
    *   Based on viewing patterns (gaze tracking, mouse movements if applicable) and predicted viewport, the client *proactively* requests and buffers tiles likely to be viewed soon.
    *   The complexity score helps prioritize which tiles to pre-buffer.
    *   Pre-buffering is throttled to avoid excessive bandwidth usage and is adapted based on network conditions.

5.  **Multiplexer Controller Adaptation:**
    *   The multiplexer controller is modified to handle tile-level requests.
    *   It maintains a database of encoded tiles for each video.
    *   It receives tile requests from clients and serves the appropriate quality level.
    *   It can dynamically adjust encoding profiles to optimize for tile-level adaptation.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Tile Selection):**

```
function selectTileQuality(tileID, availableBandwidth, predictedBandwidth, tileComplexity):
  // Get available quality levels for the tile
  qualityLevels = getTileQualityLevels(tileID)

  // Calculate a 'priority score' based on complexity and bandwidth
  priorityScore = tileComplexity * (1 - (availableBandwidth / predictedBandwidth))

  // Sort quality levels by priority score (descending)
  sortedQualityLevels = sort(qualityLevels, priorityScore)

  // Select the highest quality level that fits within the bandwidth
  selectedQualityLevel = null
  for qualityLevel in sortedQualityLevels:
    if qualityLevel.bitrate <= availableBandwidth:
      selectedQualityLevel = qualityLevel
      break

  // If no quality level fits, select the lowest quality level
  if selectedQualityLevel == null:
    selectedQualityLevel = qualityLevels[0]

  return selectedQualityLevel
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased encoder complexity (tile-based encoding)
*   Client device requires sufficient processing power for tile selection and buffering
*   Network infrastructure needs to support fine-grained requests and low latency transmission.
