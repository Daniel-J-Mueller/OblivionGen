## Adaptive Audio Masking with Predictive Emotional Response

**Concept:** Expand upon the selective audio ignoring concept to not just filter wakewords *during* output, but proactively *mask* potentially triggering audio *before* output, based on predicted emotional response of the user. This shifts from reactive silencing to proactive modulation, aiming for a more seamless and natural user experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Emotional State Profiler (ESP):**

*   **Input:** Continuous stream of biometric data (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial micro-expressions via camera), user interaction data (voice tone analysis, app usage, calendar events), and environmental context (time of day, location).
*   **Processing:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a large dataset correlating biometric/contextual data with self-reported emotional states.  Output: Probabilistic assessment of current user emotional state (e.g., “calm”, “stressed”, “focused”, “excited”). Confidence level associated with each prediction.
*   **Output:** Emotional State Vector (ESV) - numerical representation of predicted emotional state, incorporating confidence levels.

**2. Trigger Word/Phrase Database (TWPD):**

*   Data Structure: Hash table.
*   Key: Trigger word/phrase (normalized text).
*   Value: Array of emotional valence/arousal scores associated with the word/phrase, derived from large language model analysis and sentiment analysis.  Scores represent predicted emotional impact on a user.

**3. Audio Modulation Engine (AME):**

*   Input: Audio to be output, ESV, TWPD, identified trigger words/phrases within the audio.
*   Processing:
    *   **Trigger Detection:** Scan incoming audio for words/phrases in TWPD.
    *   **Emotional Impact Assessment:** For each detected trigger, calculate the predicted emotional impact on the user, based on ESV and TWPD data.
    *   **Modulation Strategy Selection:** Based on the calculated impact, select a modulation strategy:
        *   **Subtle Masking:** Introduce a low-amplitude, frequency-modulated tone that subtly obscures the trigger word without complete silencing. Aim for subconscious auditory processing.
        *   **Contextual Redundancy:**  Simultaneously output a relevant, neutral sound to create auditory masking. (e.g., a brief nature sound if the trigger is within a stressful news report).
        *   **Tempo/Pitch Shift:** Slightly alter the tempo or pitch of the audio segment containing the trigger, rendering it less salient.
        *   **Dynamic Volume Control:**  Reduce volume of the audio segment *immediately* before the trigger, then gradually return to normal.
        *   **Complete Suppression:** Reserved for high-impact triggers when user is in a fragile emotional state.
    *   **Modulation Application:** Apply the selected modulation strategy to the audio segment.
*   Output: Modulated Audio.

**4. Feedback Loop & Learning:**

*   **User Feedback:** Implement a mechanism for users to provide feedback on the effectiveness of the modulation (e.g., “Did you notice the interruption?”, "Was the audio natural?").
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Employ a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to refine the modulation strategy selection over time, based on user feedback.  The algorithm learns to optimize modulation based on individual user responses.

**Pseudocode (AME Core):**

```
function modulateAudio(audioData, emotionalStateVector, triggerWordDatabase):
  triggers = detectTriggers(audioData, triggerWordDatabase)

  for trigger in triggers:
    impactScore = calculateImpact(trigger, emotionalStateVector)

    if impactScore > threshold:
      modulationStrategy = selectStrategy(impactScore)
      modulatedAudio = applyModulation(audioData, trigger, modulationStrategy)
      return modulatedAudio

  return audioData // No triggers detected, return original audio
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires a dedicated audio processing unit (DSP) capable of real-time analysis and modulation.
*   Integration with a camera and biometric sensors for ESP input.
*   Low-latency communication between all components is critical.
