## Adaptive Data Page Tiering with Predictive Coalescing

**Concept:** Extend the coalescing mechanism to actively manage data page storage tiers (e.g., NVMe, SSD, HDD) based on predicted coalescing frequency and data access patterns. This isn’t just about optimizing storage *after* coalescing, but proactively influencing *where* data resides to minimize coalescing overhead and maximize performance.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** `TieredStorageManager` – A service integrated with the distributed storage system.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `PageTierProfile`:  Stores historical coalescing frequency, average coalescing time, data access frequency (reads/writes), data size, and current tier for a given data page.
    *   `TierPolicy`: Defines rules for tier migration based on `PageTierProfile` characteristics.  Example: "If coalescing frequency > X AND average coalescing time > Y, move to NVMe."
*   **Algorithms:**
    1.  **Profile Generation:**  The `TieredStorageManager` monitors coalescing events for each data page, collecting data to populate `PageTierProfile`.  Access frequency monitoring is performed concurrently.
    2.  **Tier Prediction:** Using historical data and potentially machine learning (linear regression, time series forecasting) the system *predicts* the future coalescing frequency and time for each page.
    3.  **Tier Migration:** Based on the predicted values and the defined `TierPolicy`, the `TieredStorageManager` initiates data page migration between storage tiers.  Migration is performed as a background process.
    4.  **Dynamic Policy Adjustment:** The `TierPolicy` is not static. It’s adjusted dynamically based on system workload, storage capacity, and overall performance goals.

**Pseudocode (Tier Migration):**

```
function migratePage(pageId, targetTier):
    // Lock the data page to prevent concurrent access
    lock(pageId)

    // Read data from the current tier
    data = readPage(pageId, currentTier)

    // Write data to the target tier
    writePage(pageId, data, targetTier)

    // Update the PageTierProfile with the new tier
    updatePageTierProfile(pageId, targetTier)

    // Unlock the data page
    unlock(pageId)
```

**Coalescing Integration:**

*   The existing coalescing process is modified to report coalescing statistics (frequency, time) to the `TieredStorageManager`.
*   When a coalesce operation completes, the system checks if the data page meets the criteria for tier migration.

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple data tiering based on access frequency. It *predicts* coalescing behavior and actively manages data placement to minimize coalescing overhead.  The integration with the existing coalescing mechanism provides a feedback loop for accurate prediction and optimization. The dynamic tier policy adapts to changing workloads and storage conditions, ensuring ongoing performance gains.
