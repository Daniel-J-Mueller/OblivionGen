## Dynamic Thermal Mapping with Microfluidic Cooling

**Concept:** Integrate a network of microfluidic channels directly into the battery pack enclosure, coupled with the existing thermistor network, to create a dynamic, localized cooling system. This allows for not just detection of thermal runaway *initiation*, but active prevention and mitigation *before* it escalates to a dangerous state.

**Specifications:**

*   **Enclosure Design:** The battery pack enclosure will be fabricated using a multi-layer material – a thermally conductive polymer base with embedded microfluidic channels etched into a mid-layer, capped by a protective outer layer.
*   **Channel Network:** The microfluidic channels will be a densely packed, serpentine network running directly over each individual battery cell (or small groups of cells). Channel dimensions: 0.5mm width, 0.3mm height. Channel material: Silicone or similar thermally conductive elastomer.
*   **Fluid Circulation:** A miniature, low-power pump (piezoelectric or similar) will circulate a dielectric coolant fluid (e.g., fluorinated alcohol) through the channels. Pump capacity: 5-10 ml/min. Reservoir capacity: 50-100 ml.
*   **Thermistor Integration:** Existing thermistor network will be augmented with flow sensors placed strategically within the microfluidic network. These flow sensors will monitor coolant flow rate and temperature gradients.
*   **Control System:**
    *   The controller (existing from the patent) will receive data from both the thermistor network and the flow sensors.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   Baseline temperature and flow rate established during normal operation.
        *   Deviation from baseline triggers increased coolant flow rate to affected cell(s).
        *   If temperature continues to rise despite increased flow, the controller will initiate a localized cooling ‘burst’ – temporarily maximizing flow to the affected area.
        *   If runaway is imminent, initiate safe shutdown procedures (as outlined in the original patent).
*   **Materials:**
    *   Enclosure: Thermally conductive polymer (e.g., polyamide-imide) with embedded silicone microchannels.
    *   Coolant: Dielectric fluorinated alcohol.
    *   Pump: Miniature piezoelectric pump.
    *   Sensors: Microfabricated thermistors and flow sensors.
*   **Communication:** CAN bus communication to the vehicle/UAV control system for reporting thermal status and initiating emergency procedures.
*   **Pseudocode (Control Loop):**

```pseudocode
//Initialization
Establish baseline temperatures for each cell
Establish baseline flow rates for each channel

//Main Loop
For Each Cell:
    Read temperature from thermistor
    Read flow rate from corresponding channel

    If (temperature > baseline + threshold):
        Increase flow rate to channel by factor X
        If (temperature continues to rise):
            Initiate 'cooling burst' – max flow
            If (Temperature reaches critical level):
                Trigger shutdown procedure
    Else:
        Maintain baseline flow rate
End For
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond *detection* of thermal runaway to *proactive prevention* through localized, dynamic cooling. The microfluidic network, combined with the existing thermistor network, allows for precise temperature control and mitigation before a critical state is reached. It is a closed loop system that allows real time temperature correction.
