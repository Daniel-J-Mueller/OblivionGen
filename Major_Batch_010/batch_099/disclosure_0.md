## Autonomous Power Line Inspection & Repair Drone Swarm

**System Overview:** A swarm of small, wirelessly-linked drones designed for automated, continuous inspection and minor repair of overhead power lines. These drones leverage the inductive charging described in the source patent, but expand functionality to include both inspection and *in-situ* repair capabilities.

**Drone Specifications (Per Unit):**

*   **Dimensions:** 15cm x 15cm x 8cm
*   **Weight:** 500g
*   **Flight System:** Quadcopter configuration with redundant motors and IMUs.
*   **Receptor:** Optimized inductive coil for efficient energy harvesting from power lines (as per source patent).
*   **Energy Storage:** Solid-state batteries (100Wh capacity).
*   **Communication:** Mesh network utilizing 5GHz and 60GHz bands for high bandwidth, low latency communication between drones and a central ground station.
*   **Payload:** 200g capacity for interchangeable modules.
*   **Navigation:** GPS, LiDAR, and visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).

**Interchangeable Payload Modules:**

1.  **High-Resolution Visual Inspection Module:** RGB camera (4K), thermal camera, and multi-spectral imaging sensor.  Data is streamed in real-time to the ground station for anomaly detection.
2.  **Laser Cleaning Module:** Low-power laser for removing surface contaminants (dust, bird droppings, etc.) from insulators.
3.  **Micro-Repair Module:**  Miniature robotic arm with adhesive application capabilities for minor insulator repairs (e.g., sealing small cracks).
4.  **Corona Discharge Detection Module:**  Sensitive sensors to detect and map corona discharge activity, indicating potential insulation failure.

**Swarm Management System:**

*   **Central Ground Station:** Runs AI-powered algorithms for swarm coordination, path planning, anomaly detection, and repair scheduling.
*   **Swarm Coordination:** Distributed algorithm for dynamic path planning, obstacle avoidance, and task allocation.  Drones communicate locally to maintain formation and avoid collisions.
*   **Task Allocation:** AI assigns tasks based on real-time data, prioritized repair needs, and drone availability.
*   **Dynamic Routing:** Algorithm optimizes flight paths based on power line geometry, weather conditions, and identified anomalies.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Redundant communication and control systems ensure swarm operation even if individual drones fail.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Deployment:** Drone swarm is launched from a mobile ground station near the power line segment to be inspected/repaired.
2.  **Initialization:** Drones establish a mesh network and synchronize their positions using GPS and LiDAR.
3.  **Inspection Phase:** Drones autonomously fly along the power lines, collecting high-resolution images, thermal data, and corona discharge readings. Data is streamed to the ground station for analysis.
4.  **Anomaly Detection:** AI algorithms analyze the collected data to identify potential problems (e.g., damaged insulators, loose connections, vegetation encroachment).
5.  **Repair Phase:** Based on the anomaly detection results, drones with appropriate repair modules are dispatched to address the identified issues. Drones use their robotic arms to perform minor repairs *in-situ*.
6.  **Continuous Monitoring:** The drone swarm continuously patrols the power lines, providing real-time monitoring and early warning of potential problems.
7.  **Recharging:**  Drones periodically position themselves near the power lines to recharge their batteries using inductive power transfer. They will 'dock' briefly, and then return to flight.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Coordination – Simplified):**

```
// Each drone executes this code

loop:
  // Get current position and sensor data
  position = get_position()
  sensor_data = get_sensor_data()

  // Communicate with nearby drones
  neighbor_data = communicate_with_neighbors()

  // Determine optimal path based on task allocation and neighbor data
  optimal_path = calculate_optimal_path(task_allocation, neighbor_data)

  // Move along optimal path
  move(optimal_path)

  // Check for obstacles and adjust path accordingly
  if (obstacle_detected()) {
    adjust_path()
  }
end loop
```

**Novelty:** This system extends the core inductive charging concept to a fully autonomous, swarm-based inspection and repair solution, enabling continuous monitoring and proactive maintenance of power lines, reducing downtime, and improving grid reliability. The ‘docking’ behaviour is a critical aspect, as is the modularity of the payload.
