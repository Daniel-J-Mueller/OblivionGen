## Transactional Aura System - v1.0

**Concept:** Extend the phrase token system to incorporate biometric and environmental data, creating a "transactional aura" that dynamically adjusts security and processing rules.

**Specifications:**

**1. Aura Profile Creation:**

*   **Biometric Input:** System integrates with device sensors (camera, microphone, accelerometer, gyroscope) to capture ongoing biometric data – facial expressions (micro-expressions), voice tonality, gait analysis, typing rhythm.  Data is streamed and processed locally on the user’s device for privacy.
*   **Environmental Input:**  System collects location data (GPS, WiFi triangulation, Bluetooth beacon proximity), ambient sound levels, lighting conditions, and detected nearby devices (Bluetooth/WiFi).
*   **Aura Vector:**  Processed biometric and environmental data is combined into a dynamic, multi-dimensional “Aura Vector” representing the user's current state and context. This vector is encrypted and transmitted (if necessary) with transactions.
*   **Baseline Calibration:** User undergoes a supervised calibration process to establish a baseline Aura Vector for “normal” transaction behavior.  This calibration is continuously updated.

**2. Dynamic Security Adjustment:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Real-time comparison of the current Aura Vector against the baseline. Significant deviations trigger increased security measures.
*   **Security Levels:** Defined security levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical) corresponding to Aura Vector deviation thresholds.
*   **Automated Escalation:**  Security level dictates required verification steps:
    *   **Low:** Standard phrase token processing.
    *   **Medium:**  Request for secondary biometric confirmation (fingerprint scan, iris scan).
    *   **High:** Multi-factor authentication (phrase token + biometric + location confirmation).
    *   **Critical:** Transaction flagged for manual review.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** System learns user behavior over time, refining Aura Vector thresholds and reducing false positives.

**3. Transactional “Mood” & Automated Offers:**

*   **Mood Inference:** Based on Aura Vector data, system infers user’s emotional state (e.g., stressed, relaxed, focused).
*   **Offer Customization:** System tailors transaction offers and experiences based on inferred mood.  (e.g., offer stress-relieving products to a stressed user).
*   **Automated Service Adjustments:**  Adjusts transaction interfaces and information presentation based on user state (e.g., simplify the interface for a distracted user).

**4. Infrastructure Requirements:**

*   **Edge Processing:**  Significant data processing must occur on user devices for privacy and latency.
*   **Secure Data Transmission:** Encrypted communication channels for transmitting Aura Vector data.
*   **Machine Learning Models:**  Robust machine learning models for biometric analysis, anomaly detection, and mood inference.
*   **Privacy Controls:** User-configurable privacy settings to control data collection and usage.
*   **Decentralized Aura Storage (Optional):**  Explore blockchain-based storage for Aura Vectors, giving users greater control over their data.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Anomaly Detection):**

```
function calculate_aura_distance(current_aura, baseline_aura):
  distance = 0
  for i in range(aura_dimension_count):
    distance += (current_aura[i] - baseline_aura[i])^2
  return sqrt(distance)

function determine_security_level(aura_distance):
  if aura_distance < threshold_low:
    return "Low"
  elif aura_distance < threshold_medium:
    return "Medium"
  elif aura_distance < threshold_high:
    return "High"
  else:
    return "Critical"
```
