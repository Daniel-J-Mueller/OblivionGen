## Adaptive Event Horizon System

**Concept:** Expand the multi-device event stitching to incorporate predictive analysis and dynamically adjust the “predetermined period of time” based on detected activity *within* the initial event capture, creating an ‘adaptive event horizon’. This moves beyond simply stitching together footage *after* an event is identified, to proactively expanding capture based on unfolding circumstances.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Activity Analysis Module:**  AI-driven module analyzing captured image/audio data in real-time.  Focuses on:
    *   **Object Trajectory Prediction:**  Predicts future movement of detected objects (people, vehicles, animals) based on current velocity, direction, and historical data.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies unusual activity patterns (e.g., rapid approach, loitering, unexpected sounds).
    *   **Contextual Awareness:**  Utilizes pre-defined “zones” (e.g., driveway, front door, perimeter) and associated priority levels.
*   **Dynamic Time Adjustment Engine:**  Responds to Activity Analysis Module output by:
    *   **Extending Capture Window:** Increases the "predetermined period of time" for devices *in the path of predicted activity* or within zones showing anomalies.  This creates a "buffer" around the initial event.
    *   **Prioritizing Recording Quality:**  Increases frame rate, resolution, or audio sensitivity for devices within the extended capture window.
    *   **Multi-Device Focus:** Dynamically adjusts camera angles and zoom levels to track predicted activity.
*   **Event Horizon Data Structure:** A time-indexed graph representing the extended capture window. Nodes are camera captures; edges represent temporal relationships and predicted object trajectories.

**2. Pseudocode – Dynamic Time Adjustment:**

```
function adjustCaptureTime(eventData, activityAnalysisResults):
  baseTimeWindow = getPredeterminedTimeWindow(eventData)
  extendedTimeWindow = baseTimeWindow

  for each anomaly in activityAnalysisResults:
    if anomaly.type == "approachingObject":
      predictedArrivalTime = anomaly.predictedArrivalTime
      timeUntilArrival = predictedArrivalTime - eventData.timestamp
      extensionAmount = max(0, timeUntilArrival - extendedTimeWindow)
      extendedTimeWindow += extensionAmount

    if anomaly.type == "unusualSound":
      extensionAmount = 5 //seconds
      extendedTimeWindow += extensionAmount

  //Limit maximum extension to avoid excessive storage
  extendedTimeWindow = min(extendedTimeWindow, MAX_EXTENSION_TIME)

  //Send updated time window to relevant devices
  broadcastTimeWindow(extendedTimeWindow, anomaly.affectedCameras)

  return extendedTimeWindow
```

**3. System Integration:**

*   **Network Communication:**  Utilizes existing network interfaces for device communication.
*   **Data Storage:** Leverages existing storage infrastructure.  Prioritizes storage of data within the extended capture window.
*   **User Interface:**  Provides options for:
    *   Configuring “zones” and priority levels.
    *   Adjusting maximum extension time.
    *   Reviewing extended event footage.

**4. Novelty and Potential:**

This system moves beyond *reactive* event stitching to *proactive* event capture.  By anticipating unfolding circumstances, it maximizes the potential for capturing critical details that might otherwise be missed. This dramatically improves incident investigation, enhances security, and creates a more comprehensive record of events.  The ‘adaptive event horizon’ concept could be applied in numerous domains – home security, traffic management, wildlife monitoring, and more.
