## Dynamic Persona-Driven Recommendation Synthesis

**Concept:** Extend the recommendation engine beyond simple browsing history to incorporate synthesized “digital personas” built from multi-source data, proactively shaping recommendations *before* browsing even occurs. This moves from reactive suggestion to predictive influence.

**Specs:**

**1. Persona Synthesis Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Web Browsing History (as in the patent).
    *   Social Media Activity (publicly available – posts, likes, shares).  API integration with major platforms.
    *   Purchasing History (optional – requires user consent/integration with e-commerce platforms).
    *   Demographic Data (age, location – anonymized/aggregated where appropriate).
    *   Content Consumption (news articles, blog posts, videos – via RSS feeds/APIs).
*   **Persona Attributes:**  Generate a dynamic set of attributes for each user. Examples:
    *   Interests (explicit & inferred).
    *   Values (environmentalism, family-oriented, etc. – inferred from content/social activity).
    *   Lifestyle (active, homebody, etc.).
    *   Personality Traits (using established models like Big Five).
    *   Current Mood (inferred from recent social activity/content consumption).
*   **Persona Vector:** Represent each user as a high-dimensional vector reflecting their persona attributes.

**2. Predictive Recommendation Engine:**

*   **Content Profiling:**  Analyze all potential recommendation content (webpages, products, articles) and create a “content vector” representing its attributes.
*   **Similarity Scoring:**  Calculate the similarity between the user’s persona vector and the content vector (using cosine similarity or similar metrics).
*   **Proactive Recommendation Generation:**  *Before* the user initiates a browsing session, generate a set of recommended content based on the highest similarity scores. Display these recommendations as a "What's New For You?" feed on a landing page or within a browser extension.
*   **Contextual Adjustment:** Modify recommendations based on real-time context:
    *   **Time of Day:**  Recommend different content in the morning vs. evening.
    *   **Location:**  Suggest local events or businesses.
    *   **Weather:**  Recommend indoor activities on rainy days.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Employ a reinforcement learning model to optimize the recommendation strategy based on user engagement (clicks, time spent on page, purchases).

**3. "Influence Budget" System:**

*   Each user is assigned a dynamic "Influence Budget" based on their engagement level. Higher engagement = larger budget.
*   The Influence Budget controls how aggressively the system pushes recommendations.  A low budget = subtle suggestions; a high budget = more prominent recommendations.
*   This prevents the system from becoming overly intrusive or annoying.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// For each user:
userPersona = synthesizePersona(userData);

// Before browsing session:
recommendations = [];
for each contentItem in contentDatabase:
  similarityScore = calculateSimilarity(userPersona, contentItem);
  recommendations.add(contentItem, similarityScore);

recommendations.sort(descending by similarityScore);

displayRecommendations(recommendations);

// During browsing session:
updateUserPersona(browsingActivity);
adjustRecommendations(updatedUserPersona);
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance computing cluster for persona synthesis and recommendation generation.
*   Large-scale data storage for user data and content database.
*   Real-time data streaming platform for capturing browsing activity.
*   Machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   APIs for accessing social media and e-commerce platforms.
