## Dynamic Region Proposal via Gaze Tracking & Contextual Awareness

**Concept:** Augment the region-of-interest (ROI) definition process with real-time gaze tracking and contextual scene understanding to dynamically refine and propose ROIs, improving object identification accuracy, especially in complex or cluttered environments.  The system moves beyond static, pre-defined regions, instead adapting to what a user *looks at* within an image.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Eye-Tracking Module:** Integrated high-resolution, low-latency eye-tracking hardware (camera & IR illuminator) capable of tracking gaze direction with sub-pixel accuracy.  Must support calibration for individual users.
*   **Depth Sensor:**  RGB-D camera (e.g., Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect) to provide depth information for scene reconstruction and object segmentation.
*   **Processing Unit:**  High-performance CPU/GPU combination for real-time processing of visual data and execution of AI models.
*   **Display:** User-facing display (integrated with the eye-tracking module) for visual feedback and interaction.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Gaze Mapping:**  Transforms eye-tracking data into 2D or 3D gaze points within the image or reconstructed scene. Calibration routines are essential for accuracy.
*   **Scene Reconstruction:** Utilizes depth data to create a 3D point cloud or mesh representation of the scene. This allows for accurate spatial reasoning and object localization.
*   **Semantic Segmentation:**  Employs a deep learning model (e.g., Mask R-CNN, DeepLab) to segment the scene into distinct object classes (person, clothing, background, etc.).
*   **Attention Module:** A neural network layer that weights the importance of different image regions based on both gaze location *and* semantic segmentation results. Regions where the user is looking *and* where a relevant object is detected receive higher attention scores.
*   **Dynamic ROI Proposal:** Based on the attention map, an algorithm proposes ROIs dynamically.  This is *not* simply a fixed-size window around the gaze point. Instead, ROIs are generated using:
    *   **Contour Following:**  Identifies object contours based on semantic segmentation and extends the ROI to encompass the entire object.
    *   **Adaptive Sizing:** Dynamically adjusts ROI size based on object distance (using depth data) and user's viewing angle.
    *   **Region Merging:** Merges adjacent ROIs if they represent the same object or are highly correlated in terms of attention scores.
*   **Object Classification:** Uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) or a fine-tuned model to classify objects within the proposed ROIs.

**3. Algorithm Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
CalibrateEyeTracker()
LoadSemanticSegmentationModel()
LoadObjectClassificationModel()

// Real-time Processing Loop
while (true) {
    // Capture image and depth data
    image, depth = CaptureData()

    // Track user's gaze
    gaze_point = TrackGaze()

    // Perform semantic segmentation
    segmentation_map = SemanticSegmentation(image)

    // Generate attention map
    attention_map = GenerateAttentionMap(gaze_point, segmentation_map)

    // Propose dynamic ROIs
    rois = ProposeROIs(attention_map, segmentation_map, depth) //contour following, adaptive sizing, region merging

    // Classify objects within ROIs
    objects = ClassifyObjects(rois, image)

    // Output results
    DisplayResults(objects)
}

// Function: GenerateAttentionMap(gaze_point, segmentation_map)
//     - Create an attention map with initial values of 0
//     - Assign higher values to regions near the gaze point
//     - Boost attention scores for regions corresponding to relevant object classes in the segmentation map
//     - Apply Gaussian smoothing to the attention map
//     return attention_map

// Function: ProposeROIs(attention_map, segmentation_map, depth)
//     - Identify regions with high attention scores
//     - Use contour following to delineate object boundaries
//     - Adjust ROI size based on object distance (from depth data) and viewing angle
//     - Merge adjacent ROIs if they represent the same object or have similar attention scores
//     return rois
```

**4.  Integration with Existing System:**

The Dynamic Region Proposal module would replace or augment the static ROI definition steps in the existing patent. The output of this module (refined ROIs) would then be fed into the object classification pipeline.

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond static regions and leverages real-time user attention to dynamically refine the focus of the object identification system, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness.  The integration of gaze tracking and semantic understanding provides a more intelligent and context-aware approach to image analysis.
