## Predictive Occupancy Mapping & ‘Ghost’ Path Alerting

**Concept:** Expand the sensor network's awareness beyond simple motion *detection* to *predict* likely occupant paths, and alert to deviations indicating potential issues (intruders, falls, or medical emergencies).

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Existing motion sensors + low-resolution ambient light/IR sensors (for rudimentary people counting/size estimation). Optional: pressure sensors integrated into flooring in key areas (hallways, bedrooms).
*   **Data Storage:** Time-series database storing sensor activation sequences, timestamps, and associated environmental data (light level, approximate occupancy count).
*   **Prediction Engine:**  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) preferred – trained on historical sensor data to predict the most probable path a user will take *given* their starting location and time of day.  The RNN outputs a probability distribution over all possible sensor activation sequences.
*   **Occupancy Map:**  A dynamic representation of the building overlaid on a floorplan.  The map visualizes the predicted path (highest probability sequence) as a highlighted route, with diminishing brightness indicating lower probability alternatives.  
*   **'Ghost' Path Detection:**  Deviation from predicted paths triggers a ‘Ghost Path Alert’.  This alert is *not* immediate.  The system monitors the user’s actual path for a short period (e.g., 30 seconds). If the actual path consistently deviates from *all* predicted paths beyond a certain threshold (e.g. 80% deviation in sensor sequence probability), the alert escalates.
*   **Alert Escalation:**
    *   **Level 1 (Minor Deviation):** Log deviation, offer visual feedback on Occupancy Map highlighting the divergence.
    *   **Level 2 (Moderate Deviation):** Send a notification to the homeowner’s device (“Unusual movement detected. Confirm status?”).
    *   **Level 3 (Significant Deviation):** Initiate emergency contact protocol (call pre-defined contacts, dispatch emergency services).
*   **Learning Adaptation:** The RNN continually re-trains based on new data, adapting to changing occupant behavior and improving prediction accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Prediction Step):**

```
FUNCTION PredictPath(startTime, startSensorID):
  // 1. Load historical data for startTime and startSensorID
  historicalData = LoadData(startTime, startSensorID)

  // 2. Input data to RNN
  inputSequence = [startSensorID]
  predictedNextSensor, probability = RNN.PredictNext(inputSequence)

  // 3. Recursively predict subsequent sensors until path completion (or max path length reached)
  path = [startSensorID]
  currentSensor = startSensorID
  WHILE path length < maxPathLength:
    inputSequence = [currentSensor]
    predictedNextSensor, probability = RNN.PredictNext(inputSequence)
    IF probability < threshold:
      BREAK // Path prediction failed
    path.append(predictedNextSensor)
    currentSensor = predictedNextSensor

  RETURN path, probability
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   Privacy features: User control over data collection and learning.
*   Multi-user support: Identify and model behavior for multiple occupants.
*   Integration with smart home ecosystem: Link to lighting, HVAC, and other devices.
*   False positive mitigation: Implement robust algorithms to minimize false alarms caused by pets or environmental factors.
