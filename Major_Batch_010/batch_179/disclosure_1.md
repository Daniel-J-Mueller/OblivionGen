## Predictive Feature Interaction Mapping for Dynamic A/B Testing

**Concept:** Extend the causal analysis system to *proactively* predict synergistic feature interactions *before* online testing, guiding A/B test design and reducing test iterations. The current system identifies impactful features *after* analysis. This system predicts *which combinations* of features will be most impactful, framing A/B tests around predicted interactions.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** "Interaction Predictor" - integrated as a pre-processing step within the existing causal inference engine.
*   **Data Input:** Historical data encompassing treatment features, control features, target metrics, *and* user behavioral sequences. Crucially includes data on feature co-occurrence (i.e. how often features are used together).
*   **Model:** Graph Neural Network (GNN) - chosen for its ability to model complex relationships between features.
    *   Nodes: Each treatment feature represents a node.
    *   Edges: Weighted edges represent the strength of correlation and co-occurrence between features, derived from historical data.  Weights are dynamically updated based on rolling data windows.
    *   Node Features: Initialized with feature statistics (mean, variance, etc.) and enriched with embeddings learned from user behavioral sequences (using RNNs).
*   **Prediction Output:** A ranked list of predicted feature interactions, scored based on predicted impact on the target metric.  The score is a composite of:
    *   GNN-predicted impact of the interaction.
    *   A 'novelty score' – penalizing interactions already extensively tested.
    *   A 'confidence score' – reflecting the robustness of the prediction based on data availability and model certainty.
*   **A/B Test Designer Module:** Receives the ranked list of predicted interactions and automatically generates A/B test hypotheses.
    *   Generates multiple test variations, exploring different combinations of the top-ranked interactions.
    *   Prioritizes tests based on predicted impact, novelty, and confidence.
    *   Dynamically adjusts test parameters (sample size, duration) based on predicted effect size.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Results of A/B tests are fed back into the GNN to refine feature embeddings, edge weights, and prediction accuracy.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Initialization: Load historical data, train initial GNN model
data = load_historical_data()
model = train_GNN(data)

# Main loop:
while True:
    # 1. Predict Feature Interactions
    interaction_predictions = model.predict_interactions(data)  # Returns ranked list of interactions
    # 2. Generate A/B Test Hypotheses
    test_hypotheses = generate_ab_tests(interaction_predictions, num_tests=5) # Generate 5 test variations

    # 3. Run A/B Tests (external process) - Assume A/B test framework exists.

    # 4. Receive A/B Test Results (external process)

    # 5. Update Model with A/B Test Results
    model.update_model(ab_test_results)

    # 6. Re-evaluate and continue loop
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   GPU-accelerated compute for GNN training and inference.
*   Scalable data storage for historical data.
*   Integration with existing A/B testing framework.
*   Python-based implementation utilizing PyTorch or TensorFlow for GNN model development.
