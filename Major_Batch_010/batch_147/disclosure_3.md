## Adaptive Challenge Sequencing for SSH

**Concept:** Enhance SSH authentication by dynamically adjusting the challenge complexity and frequency based on observed client behavior and environmental factors. This goes beyond static challenges and introduces a risk-adaptive authentication layer.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profiling Module:**

*   **Data Input:** SSH connection attempts, including source IP, timestamp, attempted usernames, and initial key exchange parameters.
*   **Analysis:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., anomaly detection, Hidden Markov Model) to establish baseline behavioral profiles for known clients/IP ranges. Track deviations from these baselines. Factors to consider:
    *   Connection frequency.
    *   Time of day/week.
    *   Geographic location (if available).
    *   Key exchange algorithms used.
    *   Response times.
*   **Output:** Risk score (0-100) representing the likelihood of a malicious or unauthorized connection attempt.

**2. Challenge Generation & Sequencing Engine:**

*   **Challenge Types:**
    *   **Standard Timestamp/MAC:**  (as in the referenced patent) â€“ low complexity.
    *   **Cryptographic Puzzle:**  A computationally intensive, but solvable, cryptographic problem. Difficulty adjustable.
    *   **Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA):**  Questions derived from publicly available information about the user/organization.
    *   **Device Fingerprinting:** Collect hardware/software data to create a unique client ID (privacy considerations required).
*   **Sequencing Logic:**
    *   **Low Risk (Score < 30):**  Standard Timestamp/MAC challenge.
    *   **Medium Risk (Score 30-70):**  Timestamp/MAC + Cryptographic Puzzle (moderate difficulty).
    *   **High Risk (Score 70-90):**  Timestamp/MAC + Cryptographic Puzzle (high difficulty) + KBA.
    *   **Critical Risk (Score > 90):**  Terminate connection.  Log event. Trigger security alert.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system monitors client responsiveness during the challenge sequence.  Slow or incorrect responses increase the risk score and escalate the challenge complexity. Successful, rapid responses lower the risk score and de-escalate challenges.

**3.  SSH Integration:**

*   **Modified SSH Daemon:**  The SSH daemon must be modified to intercept the key exchange phase.
*   **Challenge Injection:** The daemon injects the generated challenge into a custom SSH message (using an SSH extension or a reserved field).
*   **Challenge Response Handling:** The daemon verifies the client's response to the challenge before proceeding with the key exchange.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Server Side
function handle_ssh_connection(socket) {
  client_profile = get_client_profile(socket.remote_address);
  risk_score = calculate_risk_score(client_profile);

  challenge = generate_challenge(risk_score);
  send_challenge(socket, challenge);

  response = receive_challenge_response(socket);
  if (verify_response(response, challenge)) {
    proceed_with_key_exchange(socket);
  } else {
    terminate_connection(socket);
  }
}

function generate_challenge(risk_score) {
  if (risk_score < 30) {
    return generate_timestamp_mac_challenge();
  } else if (risk_score < 70) {
    return generate_timestamp_mac_challenge() + generate_cryptographic_puzzle(moderate_difficulty);
  } else {
    return generate_timestamp_mac_challenge() + generate_cryptographic_puzzle(high_difficulty) + generate_kba_question();
  }
}

// Client Side (SSH Client Modification)
function handle_ssh_challenge(socket) {
  challenge = receive_challenge(socket);
  response = solve_challenge(challenge);
  send_response(socket, response);
}
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:**  KBA questions and device fingerprinting must be implemented with strict privacy safeguards and user consent.
*   **Performance:** Cryptographic puzzles should be computationally feasible to avoid excessive connection delays.
*   **Scalability:** The behavioral profiling module must be scalable to handle a large number of clients.
*   **False Positives:** Fine-tune the risk scoring algorithm to minimize false positives and avoid blocking legitimate users.
