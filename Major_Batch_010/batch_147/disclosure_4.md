**Adaptive Predictive Data Relocation System**

**Concept:** This system anticipates potential power loss events *before* the bulk capacitance kicks in, and proactively relocates critical data to a redundant, ultra-fast storage tier – not just for power-loss protection, but for general performance enhancement.

**Specs:**

*   **Tiered Storage:** System comprises three storage tiers:
    *   **Tier 1: Ultra-Fast, Volatile Cache:** Small capacity (e.g., 16-64GB) DRAM or emerging persistent memory technology. Extremely low latency.
    *   **Tier 2: Non-Volatile Main Storage:** Existing NVMe SSDs or similar. Moderate latency.
    *   **Tier 3: Redundant, Ultra-Fast Storage:**  Small capacity (e.g., 8-32GB) of persistent memory (e.g., Intel Optane, or similar).  Acts as a 'panic room' for critical data.

*   **Predictive Analytics Engine:** Software module that analyzes system workload, power consumption trends, and environmental factors (e.g., temperature) to predict potential power loss events. It doesn't *react* to loss; it anticipates.

*   **Data Classification & Prioritization:**  Data is classified based on criticality (e.g., transaction logs, in-flight operations, metadata).  Higher priority data is tagged for pre-emptive relocation.

*   **Relocation Algorithm:**
    1.  During normal operation, continuously monitor data access patterns and priority tags.
    2.  The Predictive Analytics Engine calculates a 'Risk Score' based on real-time data and predictions.
    3.  If the Risk Score exceeds a threshold:
        *   Critical data tagged for relocation is copied to Tier 3.
        *   A 'Relocation Completion Flag' is set.
    4.  Upon actual power loss detection (as in the original patent), the system:
        *   Verifies the Relocation Completion Flag.
        *   If complete, initiates a fast recovery from Tier 3.
        *   If incomplete, falls back to the original patent's bulk capacitance-based protection.

*   **Hardware Acceleration:**  Dedicated DMA engine to accelerate data transfer between tiers, minimizing performance overhead.

*   **Power Management Integration:**  The system leverages the power supply’s power management bus (as described in claim 4/13 of the original patent) to receive not only power loss alerts, but also to monitor power consumption trends *before* a failure.

**Pseudocode (Relocation Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION RelocateData(dataBlock, priority)
  IF priority > threshold THEN
    COPY dataBlock FROM Tier 2 TO Tier 3
    SET RelocationCompletionFlag = TRUE
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION HandlePowerLoss()
  IF RelocationCompletionFlag = TRUE THEN
    RECOVER data FROM Tier 3
  ELSE
    INITIATE bulkCapacitanceProtection() // Fallback to original patent's method
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

LOOP
  FOREACH dataBlock IN activeData
    RelocateData(dataBlock, dataBlock.priority)
  ENDFOR
  MonitorPowerSupply()
  CalculateRiskScore()
ENDLOOP
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simply *reacting* to power loss and proactively mitigates its impact. By anticipating failure and pre-relocating critical data, it can achieve faster recovery times and potentially prevent data loss altogether, while also improving normal operation performance. The tiered storage architecture with the dedicated ultra-fast tier is key to this enhancement.
