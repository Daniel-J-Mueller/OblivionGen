## Federated Query Execution with Dynamic Trust Scoring

**Specification:** A system for executing queries across multiple, independent databases (potentially owned by different entities) without centralizing data, incorporating a dynamic trust scoring system to manage execution priorities and data access control.

**Core Concept:** Extend the sandboxing concept to a *federated* environment. Instead of a single sandboxed executor, we have a network of sandboxed executors, each associated with a data source. Queries are decomposed into sub-queries executed within these sandboxes. A dynamic trust score governs which executors are prioritized and granted access to sensitive data.

**Components:**

1.  **Query Decomposer:** Receives the initial query and breaks it down into sub-queries that can be executed against individual data sources.  Uses a cost-based optimizer to determine the most efficient execution plan.
2.  **Federated Query Coordinator:** Orchestrates the execution of sub-queries across the network of sandboxed executors.  Monitors execution status and aggregates results.  Implements the dynamic trust scoring system.
3.  **Sandboxed Executors:**  Each data source has an associated sandboxed executor. These executors receive sub-queries, execute them against the local data source, and return results to the Federated Query Coordinator.  All code execution happens within the sandbox.
4.  **Trust Scoring Engine:** Calculates a trust score for each sandboxed executor based on a variety of factors (see Trust Score Factors below).
5.  **Data Access Control Policy:** Defines which data can be accessed by executors with different trust scores.

**Trust Score Factors:**

*   **Executor Provenance:**  Was the executor built in-house or is it a third-party component?
*   **Code Integrity:**  Has the executor's code been verified and signed?
*   **Resource Usage:**  Is the executor consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth)?
*   **Execution History:**  Has the executor exhibited any malicious behavior in the past?
*   **Compliance Certifications:**  Does the executor meet relevant security and compliance standards (e.g., SOC 2, GDPR)?
*   **Reputation (Network-based):** Other executors providing feedback on its behavior.

**Pseudocode (Query Execution Flow):**

```
function ExecuteFederatedQuery(query):
  subQueries = DecomposeQuery(query)
  executorList = GetAvailableExecutors()

  for subQuery in subQueries:
    eligibleExecutors = []
    for executor in executorList:
      trustScore = CalculateTrustScore(executor)
      if trustScore > Threshold and CanExecutorAccessData(executor, subQuery):
        eligibleExecutors.append(executor)

    if eligibleExecutors is empty:
      return Error("No eligible executors found for subquery")

    bestExecutor = SelectBestExecutor(eligibleExecutors) // Based on trust score, cost, latency

    result = bestExecutor.Execute(subQuery)
    results.append(result)

  return AggregateResults(results)
```

**Data Access Control:**

Implement a tiered access control system.  Executors with higher trust scores can access more sensitive data.  For example:

*   **High Trust:** Full access to all data.
*   **Medium Trust:** Access to public and anonymized data.
*   **Low Trust:** No access to sensitive data.

**Scalability & Fault Tolerance:**

*   **Executor Replication:** Deploy multiple replicas of each executor to provide high availability and scalability.
*   **Dynamic Executor Discovery:** Use a service discovery mechanism to automatically discover and register new executors.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  Implement retry mechanisms and circuit breakers to handle executor failures.

**Innovation:**  This system extends the security of sandboxed execution to a federated environment, allowing for secure and scalable query processing across multiple data sources without compromising data privacy or security. The dynamic trust scoring system adds a layer of adaptability and resilience, ensuring that queries are executed by trustworthy executors. This could unlock capabilities around secure data marketplaces and collaborative analytics.
