## Adaptable Haptic Feedback Case

**Concept:** An earbuds case incorporating localized haptic feedback to indicate charging status, notification alerts, and even EQ presets *through the case itself*. This moves beyond simple LED indicators and offers a more intuitive, tactile experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Case Material:** Multi-layered composite. Outer shell: Rigid polycarbonate for protection. Intermediate layer: Flexible TPU containing integrated haptic actuators. Inner lining: Microfiber to protect earbuds.
*   **Haptic Actuators:** An array of miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) embedded within the TPU layer. Resolution: Minimum 3x3 grid, ideally 5x5 or higher for granular control.  Actuators are individually addressable via microcontroller.
*   **Charging Indication:**
    *   Low Battery: Slow, pulsing haptic feedback on the bottom of the case.
    *   Charging:  A ‘flowing’ wave pattern of haptic taps across the case surface, indicating charging progress. Speed of wave correlated to charging rate.
    *   Full Charge:  A short, distinct haptic ‘chime’ across the entire case surface.
*   **Notification Alerts:**
    *   Incoming Call: Rapid, rhythmic tapping on the upper portion of the case.
    *   Text Message:  A short burst of haptic feedback on the side of the case.
    *   App Notification:  Customizable haptic patterns assigned to specific apps. (User selectable via companion app)
*   **EQ Preset Indication:**
    *   Cycle through presets via button on case. Each preset is indicated by a unique, subtle haptic pattern played across the case. (e.g., "Bass Boost" = low-frequency rumble, "Treble Boost" = high-frequency taps)
*   **Microcontroller:** Low-power ARM Cortex-M4 based microcontroller with Bluetooth LE connectivity.
*   **Power:** Integrated rechargeable battery (separate from earbud charging) powering the haptic system. Wireless charging compatible (Qi standard).
*   **Companion App:** iOS and Android app to customize haptic patterns, notification assignments, EQ presets, and adjust overall haptic intensity.

**Pseudocode (Notification Handling):**

```
function handle_notification(notification_type, app_name):
  if notification_type == "incoming_call":
    play_haptic_pattern("call_pattern", case_upper_section)
  else if notification_type == "text_message":
    play_haptic_pattern("message_pattern", case_side_section)
  else if notification_type == "app_notification":
    app_pattern = get_app_haptic_pattern(app_name)
    if app_pattern != null:
      play_haptic_pattern(app_pattern, case_full)
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   Explore using different haptic actuators (e.g., eccentric rotating mass motors) for varying feedback characteristics.
*   Investigate using machine learning to predict user preferences for haptic patterns.
*   Consider incorporating pressure sensors on the case to allow for gesture-based control.
*   Material science is key: Explore materials that maximize haptic sensation transmission.
