## Dynamic Graph Pruning with Predictive Reach

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on identifying relevant neighborhoods via random walks and visit counts. This design expands upon that concept by introducing *predictive reach* – a system that doesn’t just count visits, but *predicts* future influence based on early-stage walk data. This allows for dynamic pruning of the graph, focusing computational resources on areas most likely to yield meaningful embeddings *before* the full random walk is completed.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   **Node State:** Each node maintains:
    *   `visit_count`:  Integer representing the number of times visited during the current walk.
    *   `potential_reach`:  Float representing a predicted value of future influence. Initialized to 0.0.
    *   `decay_rate`: Float. Controls how quickly `potential_reach` decreases when no new connections are discovered.
    *   `embedding_vector`:  Vector representing the current embedding for the node.
*   **Graph Representation:** Adjacency list or similar efficient graph structure.

**2. Algorithm – Predictive Walk & Pruning:**

```pseudocode
function predictive_walk(graph, start_node, num_iterations):
  current_node = start_node
  visit_list = {} // stores visit counts for the target node's walk
  
  for i in range(num_iterations):
    if current_node not in visit_list:
      visit_list[current_node] = 0
    visit_list[current_node] += 1
    
    neighbors = graph.get_neighbors(current_node)
    if not neighbors:
        break //dead end
    
    //Predictive Pruning Logic
    potential_reach_values = []
    for neighbor in neighbors:
        potential_reach_values.append((neighbor, estimate_potential_reach(graph, neighbor, visit_list)))
    
    potential_reach_values.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    //Select top K neighbors based on potential reach
    top_k_neighbors = potential_reach_values[:K]
    
    //Randomly select next node from top K neighbors
    if top_k_neighbors:
        next_node = random.choice(top_k_neighbors)[0]
        current_node = next_node
    else:
        break // No eligible neighbors
    
  return visit_list
```

**3. `estimate_potential_reach(graph, node, visit_list)` Function:**

```pseudocode
function estimate_potential_reach(graph, node, visit_list):
  // Base reach - starts with a baseline based on existing visits
  reach = node.visit_count 

  // Influence from connected nodes
  for neighbor in graph.get_neighbors(node):
    reach += neighbor.visit_count * 0.5 // Adjust weight as needed

  // Decay factor - penalizes nodes with stagnation
  reach *= (1 - node.decay_rate)

  return reach
```

**4. Dynamic Decay Rate Adjustment:**

*   Each node’s `decay_rate` dynamically adjusts based on the frequency of new connections discovered during the walk.
*   If a node frequently leads to previously unvisited nodes, its `decay_rate` decreases, increasing its `potential_reach`.
*   If a node consistently leads to already visited nodes, its `decay_rate` increases, decreasing its `potential_reach`.

**5. System Integration:**

*   The `predictive_walk` function replaces the current random walk implementation.
*   The system periodically recalculates and updates `potential_reach` and `decay_rate` for all nodes in the graph.
*   Embedding aggregation prioritizes nodes with higher `potential_reach`.



This system creates a feedback loop where the graph dynamically prunes itself, focusing computational resources on areas with the most potential for generating meaningful embeddings. This could lead to significant performance improvements and allow for scaling to much larger graphs.
