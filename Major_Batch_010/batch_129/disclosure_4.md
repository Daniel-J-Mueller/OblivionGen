## Modular Environmental Sensor Integration

**Concept:** Expand the line isolating power connector to function as a central hub for localized environmental monitoring, leveraging the existing conduit structure for sensor wiring and power delivery.

**Specs:**

*   **Housing Modification:** The existing housing will be expanded in length and width to accommodate a modular sensor bay. This bay will consist of standardized slots accepting various sensor modules. The housing material will shift to a thermally conductive plastic.
*   **Sensor Modules:**
    *   **Temperature/Humidity:** Standard digital temperature/humidity sensor (DHT22 or equivalent) with a small fan for forced air circulation.
    *   **VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) Sensor:** MQ-135 or equivalent, providing air quality data.
    *   **Light Sensor:** BH1750 or equivalent, measuring ambient light levels.
    *   **Vibration Sensor:** Piezoelectric accelerometer for detecting mechanical vibrations.
    *   **EM Field Sensor:** Detects electromagnetic fields.
*   **Power Distribution:** The connector will integrate a small DC-DC converter, drawing power from the line/neutral wires (after appropriate isolation and regulation) to supply the sensor modules. Voltage will be selectable (3.3V, 5V) to support various sensors.
*   **Data Communication:**
    *   **Wired:** A dedicated RJ45 port will provide Ethernet connectivity for data transmission.
    *   **Wireless:** Integrated ESP32 module providing WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity.
*   **Conduit Integration:** Existing line/neutral conduits will have dedicated breakout points to route sensor wiring to the sensor bay. These breakout points will utilize shielded wiring to minimize interference.
*   **Software:**
    *   Web server hosted on ESP32 providing real-time sensor data via a user-friendly interface.
    *   Data logging to internal flash memory or external SD card (optional).
    *   Alerting system: Email/SMS notifications based on predefined thresholds.
*   **Aperture Modification:** The aperture will be widened to accommodate sensor module wiring and potentially a small cable gland for additional external sensors.
*   **Physical Dimensions:** Overall housing length increased by 5-7cm. Increased width and depth by 2-3cm to accommodate the sensor bay.
*   **Mounting:** Standard DIN rail mounting option.

**Pseudocode (Data Acquisition & Transmission):**

```
LOOP:
    READ_TEMPERATURE()
    READ_HUMIDITY()
    READ_VOC()
    READ_LIGHT()
    READ_VIBRATION()

    DATA = {
        "temperature": TEMPERATURE,
        "humidity": HUMIDITY,
        "voc": VOC,
        "light": LIGHT,
        "vibration": VIBRATION,
        "timestamp": CURRENT_TIME()
    }

    IF (WIFI_CONNECTED()):
        SEND_DATA_TO_CLOUD(DATA)
    ELSE:
        LOG_DATA_TO_SD_CARD(DATA)

    DELAY(10 seconds)
ENDLOOP
```

**Refinement Notes:** The system will use a microcontroller to oversee data acquisition and communications. Sensor modules will be connected via standard connectors. The overall goal is to provide localized environmental monitoring capability integrated directly into the power infrastructure. This could be useful in data centers, server rooms, or any environment where detailed environmental data is critical.
