## Decentralized Data Attestation with Dynamic Schema Evolution

**Concept:** Leverage the blockchain-backed database concept to create a system where data *attestations* – proofs of data existence and integrity at a specific time – are stored on the ledger, while the *data itself* resides off-chain in a distributed storage network.  Crucially, the schema used to interpret that data isn't fixed, but evolves *alongside* the data, with schema changes also attested on the blockchain.

**Motivation:**  The patent focuses on asset tracking and state management. This expands that to any data requiring verifiable history, particularly in environments where data structures are likely to change over time (e.g., scientific datasets, medical records, evolving IoT sensor data).  It addresses the limitations of static schemas by allowing for flexible data evolution *without* losing verifiable history.

**System Components:**

1.  **Data Storage Network:** A distributed storage system (IPFS, Filecoin, Swarm) holds the actual data objects.
2.  **Attestation Layer (Blockchain):** A blockchain (Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos) stores attestations and schema definitions.
3.  **Schema Registry:** A smart contract on the blockchain managing schema versions.
4.  **Data Publisher API:** Allows external entities to publish data objects to the storage network and create attestations.
5.  **Data Resolver API:** Allows retrieval of data objects based on attestation IDs, resolving the data from the storage network and applying the correct schema version.

**Data Structures (on Blockchain - Smart Contracts):**

*   **Attestation:**
    *   `attestationID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `dataHash`: Hash of the data object in the storage network.
    *   `schemaVersion`:  Pointer to the schema version used to interpret the data.
    *   `timestamp`:  Time of attestation.
    *   `publisher`: Address of the data publisher.
*   **Schema Definition:**
    *   `schemaVersion`:  Version number.
    *   `schemaHash`:  Hash of the schema definition (e.g., JSON Schema, Protobuf definition).
    *   `schemaContent`: The schema definition itself (optional - can be stored off-chain and referenced by the hash).
    *   `migrationRules`: Rules for migrating data from older schema versions to the current version (critical for data compatibility).

**Workflow:**

1.  **Data Publication:** A data publisher uploads a data object to the distributed storage network.
2.  **Schema Selection:** The publisher selects the appropriate schema version for the data.  If a new schema version is required, it is published to the Schema Registry.
3.  **Attestation Creation:** The publisher creates an Attestation object, including the data hash, schema version, timestamp, and publisher address.  This Attestation is committed to the blockchain.
4.  **Data Retrieval:** A data resolver receives an Attestation ID.
5.  **Schema Resolution:** The resolver retrieves the Schema Definition associated with the schema version from the Attestation.
6.  **Data Fetching:** The resolver uses the data hash to fetch the data object from the distributed storage network.
7.  **Data Validation & Transformation:**  The resolver validates the data against the schema and applies any necessary transformation rules (based on `migrationRules` if necessary) to ensure compatibility.
8.  **Data Delivery:** The validated and transformed data is delivered to the requesting application.

**Pseudocode (Data Resolver API - `resolveData` function):**

```pseudocode
function resolveData(attestationID) {
  attestation = blockchain.getAttestation(attestationID)
  schemaVersion = attestation.schemaVersion
  schema = blockchain.getSchema(schemaVersion)
  dataHash = attestation.dataHash
  data = storageNetwork.getData(dataHash)

  // Apply migration rules if schema version is different from the current schema
  if (schema.schemaVersion != currentSchemaVersion) {
    data = applyMigrationRules(data, schema.schemaVersion, currentSchemaVersion)
  }

  // Validate data against schema
  if (!validateData(data, schema)) {
    throw Error("Data validation failed")
  }

  return data
}
```

**Innovation Highlights:**

*   **Dynamic Schema Evolution:**  Allows data structures to evolve over time without breaking compatibility or losing verifiable history.
*   **Decoupled Storage & Attestation:** Separates the potentially large data objects from the blockchain, reducing storage costs and improving scalability.
*   **Verifiable Data Provenance:** Provides a tamper-proof record of data existence, integrity, and evolution.
*   **Flexible Data Interpretation:** Enables different applications to interpret the same data in different ways, based on the schema version.
