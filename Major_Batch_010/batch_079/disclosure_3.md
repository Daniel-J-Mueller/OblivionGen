## Dynamic Predictive Occlusion Mapping for Multi-Agent Tracking

**Concept:** Extend the agent re-verification system with a dynamic predictive occlusion mapping layer. The system currently resolves identity switches *after* they occur. This extension aims to predict potential identity conflicts *before* they happen, utilizing a probabilistic occlusion map.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:**
    *   Live video streams from multiple cameras (existing system).
    *   3D skeletal pose estimations for all detected agents (existing or added capability).
    *   Real-time environment map data: Point cloud or mesh representing static obstacles (walls, shelving, etc.). This could come from LiDAR or stereo cameras, or be a pre-loaded facility map.
*   **Occlusion Map Generation:**
    *   For each agent, calculate a "visibility cone" based on camera positions and agent pose.
    *   Raycast from agent's estimated skeletal joints through the visibility cone, intersecting with the environment map.
    *   Calculate an occlusion probability for each joint based on the number/density of intersections. Higher intersections = higher occlusion probability.
    *   Create a dynamic occlusion map: A per-agent map showing the likelihood of each body part being hidden from view by the environment or other agents.
*   **Predictive Identity Conflict Detection:**
    *   When two agents approach each other or an obstacle, the system analyzes their occlusion maps.
    *   If the occlusion maps overlap significantly, indicating both agents' key features (head, torso) are likely to be obscured simultaneously, a "potential identity conflict" is flagged.
*   **Preemptive Re-verification:**
    *   Upon flagging a potential conflict:
        1.  Increase the frequency of feature vector updates for both agents.
        2.  Prioritize re-verification checks using a weighted score:
            *   Occlusion map overlap score (higher = more urgent).
            *   Proximity score (closer agents = more urgent).
            *   Velocity score (faster agents = more urgent).
        3.  Use a "look-ahead" algorithm to predict the agentsâ€™ future trajectories and potential occlusions, preemptively triggering re-verification before a full identity switch occurs.
*   **Confidence Scoring:**
    *   Assign a confidence score to each re-verification check based on the predictive occlusion data and feature vector similarity.
    *   Thresholding the confidence score determines whether to flag a true identity switch.
*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   High-performance computing platform for real-time data processing.
    *   GPU acceleration for raycasting and feature vector calculations.
    *   Multi-camera synchronization system.

**Pseudocode - Predictive Occlusion Calculation:**

```
function calculate_occlusion(agent, environment_map, camera_positions):
    occlusion_map = {}
    for joint in agent.joints:
        occlusion_map[joint] = 0
        for camera in camera_positions:
            ray = cast_ray(joint, camera)
            intersections = ray_intersects(ray, environment_map)
            occlusion_map[joint] += len(intersections)  // Accumulate intersection count
    return occlusion_map

function predict_conflict(agent1, agent2, occlusion_map1, occlusion_map2):
    overlap = calculate_map_overlap(occlusion_map1, occlusion_map2)
    if overlap > threshold:
        return True
    else:
        return False

```

**Further Exploration:**

*   **Agent Interaction Modeling:** Incorporate models of typical human behavior to predict more accurately the likelihood of agents blocking each other's views.
*   **Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion:** Integrate data from other sensors (e.g., infrared depth sensors) to improve occlusion map accuracy.
*   **Adaptive Thresholding:** Dynamically adjust the occlusion threshold based on facility layout and agent density.
