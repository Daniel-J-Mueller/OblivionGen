**Context-Aware Session ‘Shadowing’ & Proactive Hand-off**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the session transfer concept to include a ‘shadowing’ mode. Instead of a full transfer, a new device *joins* the existing session as a silent observer, with the ability to seamlessly *become* the primary participant. This is coupled with proactive hand-off based on predicted user context.

**II. Components:**

*   **Context Engine:**  Analyzes data points (location, device activity, network conditions, calendar, biometric data if authorized) to predict session disruption or potential benefit of hand-off.  This is more than simple availability; it’s *predictive* availability.
*   **Shadowing Module:**  Facilitates the addition of a device to a session as a silent observer.  Data streams (audio, video, screen share) are mirrored to the shadow device.  Minimal latency is critical.
*   **Hand-off Manager:** Orchestrates the transition from primary to shadow device.  Handles signaling, data stream redirection, and permission updates.
*   **Adaptive Bandwidth Allocation:**  Dynamically adjusts bandwidth based on network conditions and the number of active/shadow devices.
*   **Privacy Control:**  Granular controls for users to specify which devices can be added as shadows, and for how long.  "Ephemeral Shadowing" – auto-termination after a pre-defined duration.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Session Initiation:** A session is established between two devices (Device A & Device B).
2.  **Context Monitoring:** The Context Engine continuously monitors the user’s context.
3.  **Shadow Candidate Identification:** Based on context (e.g., user entering a low-bandwidth area, user picking up a preferred device), the system identifies a potential ‘shadow’ device (Device C).
4.  **Shadow Invitation:** An invitation is sent to Device C.  The invitation includes session details and the option to join as a shadow.
5.  **Shadow Joining:**  Device C accepts the invitation and joins the session as a shadow. Audio/video/screen share are mirrored.
6.  **Proactive Hand-off (Optional):** If the Context Engine predicts an issue with Device A (e.g., low battery, poor network signal), it prompts the user to switch to Device C.
7.  **Seamless Transition:** Upon user confirmation, the Hand-off Manager seamlessly transitions Device C to become the primary device.  Device A is either disconnected or becomes a shadow.

**IV. Pseudocode (Hand-off Manager – Simplified):**

```
function initiateHandOff(primaryDevice, shadowDevice):
  // 1. Signal primary device to prepare for handoff
  sendSignal(primaryDevice, HANDOFF_PREPARE)

  // 2. Signal shadow device to become primary
  sendSignal(shadowDevice, BECOME_PRIMARY)

  // 3. Redirect data streams (audio, video, screen share) from primary to shadow
  redirectDataStreams(primaryDevice, shadowDevice)

  // 4. Update session metadata (primary device ID)
  updateSessionMetadata(shadowDevice)

  // 5. Disconnect/Shadow primary device
  disconnectOrShadow(primaryDevice)

  // 6. Acknowledge handoff completion
  sendSignal(shadowDevice, HANDOFF_COMPLETE)
end function

function disconnectOrShadow(device):
  if userPreference == "disconnect":
    disconnect(device)
  else:
    shadow(device)
  end if
end function
```

**V. Use Cases:**

*   **Commuting:** Seamlessly transfer a video call from a phone to a laptop upon arriving at the office.
*   **Meetings:**  Switch between a tablet and a laptop during a presentation.
*   **Accessibility:**  Allow a support person to ‘shadow’ a session to provide real-time assistance.
*   **Emergency Situations:**  Transfer a call to a more reliable device in case of an emergency.
