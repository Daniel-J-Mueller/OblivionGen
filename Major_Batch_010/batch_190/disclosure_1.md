## Dynamic Certificate Trust Scoring with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Augment the certificate revocation system with a real-time trust scoring system that integrates behavioral biometrics gathered *during* a TLS handshake. This goes beyond simple revocation lists, adding a dynamic layer of trust based on observed handshake characteristics.

**Specification:**

1.  **Behavioral Data Collection Module:**
    *   During TLS handshake, capture handshake timings (round trip times, packet arrival patterns), cipher suite negotiation order, supported protocol versions, and TLS extension negotiation sequence.
    *   Normalize and vectorize these data points into a 'handshake profile'.
    *   Employ a rolling window averaging technique to account for network jitter and temporary fluctuations.

2.  **Trust Scoring Engine:**
    *   Maintain a baseline 'good' handshake profile for each CA. This baseline is established from observations of known good clients.
    *   Calculate a similarity score between the observed handshake profile and the baseline. Use cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or a more complex machine learning model trained on good/bad handshake data.
    *   Integrate the similarity score with the existing revocation list status. A certificate that *isn't* revoked can still have a low trust score, while a revoked certificate with unusual handshake characteristics could have its revocation status reinforced.
    *   Implement a threshold-based trust score. Below a certain threshold, the connection is blocked or requires additional authentication (e.g., MFA).

3.  **Adaptive Learning System:**
    *   Implement a feedback loop where observed handshake profiles are used to refine the baseline profiles.
    *   Use anomaly detection techniques to identify potentially compromised clients or servers.
    *   Employ federated learning to share trust scoring models across a network of providers without directly exchanging sensitive data.

4.  **Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration:**
    *   Store baseline handshake profiles and trust scoring models within a secure HSM to prevent tampering.
    *   Perform trust scoring calculations within the HSM to ensure the integrity of the process.

**Pseudocode (Trust Scoring Calculation):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(handshakeProfile, baselineProfile, revocationStatus):
  similarityScore = calculateCosineSimilarity(handshakeProfile, baselineProfile)
  
  if revocationStatus == "REVOKED":
    trustScore = similarityScore * 0.1 // Significantly reduce score for revoked cert
  else:
    trustScore = similarityScore * 0.9 // Higher weight for non-revoked certs
    
  // Apply thresholding
  if trustScore < TRUST_THRESHOLD:
    blockConnection()
    return 0
  else:
    return trustScore
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard server infrastructure for running the software components.
*   HSM for secure storage and processing.
*   Network monitoring infrastructure for capturing TLS handshake data.

**Software Requirements:**

*   TLS interception libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, BoringSSL).
*   Machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Database for storing handshake profiles and trust scores.
*   API for integrating with existing authentication and authorization systems.
