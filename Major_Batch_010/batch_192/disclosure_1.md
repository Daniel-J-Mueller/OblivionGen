## Adaptive Sequence Chunking with Contextual Gating

**Concept:** Extend the Markovian tagging approach by dynamically chunking the input sequence into variable-length segments *before* applying the neural network.  This allows the system to capture longer-range dependencies than a strict Markov model, while still maintaining computational efficiency.  Crucially, a 'contextual gate' controls which segments are considered for each token, based on learned relevance.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sequence Chunking Module:**
    *   Input: Raw sequence of tokens.
    *   Process: Implement a sliding window that analyzes token embeddings.  A learned segmentation model (separate neural network – e.g., a lightweight LSTM or Transformer) identifies natural segment boundaries based on semantic coherence. The segment length is variable, determined by the model.
    *   Output:  A list of segments, each containing a sequence of tokens. Segment IDs are assigned.

2.  **Contextual Gating Network:**
    *   Input: Current token embedding, segment IDs of all available segments, hidden state from the primary tagging network.
    *   Process: A small, feedforward neural network predicts a 'gate' value (0-1) for each segment. The gate value represents the relevance of that segment to the current token.  The network learns which segments are informative based on the hidden state – effectively a learned attention mechanism over segments.  Sigmoid activation function used for gate values.
    *   Output: A vector of gate values, one for each segment.

3.  **Augmented Tagging Network:**
    *   Input: Current token embedding, gated segment embeddings (see below).
    *   Process: 
        *   For each segment, multiply its embedding by the corresponding gate value from the Contextual Gating Network.  This selectively attenuates irrelevant segments.
        *   Concatenate the gated segment embeddings with the current token embedding.
        *   Feed the concatenated vector into the primary tagging network (as described in the base patent).
    *   Output: Probability distribution over labels for the current token.

4.  **Training Procedure:**
    *   Standard supervised learning with labeled sequence data.
    *   Loss function: Cross-entropy loss for label prediction + regularization term to encourage sparsity in the gate values (L1 regularization). This promotes efficient segment selection.
    *   Jointly train the Sequence Chunking Module, Contextual Gating Network, and Augmented Tagging Network.

**Pseudocode (Augmented Tagging Network – Core Step):**

```python
def augmented_tagging_step(token_embedding, segment_embeddings, gate_values, tagging_network):
    """
    Performs a single tagging step with segment augmentation.

    Args:
        token_embedding: Embedding of the current token (vector).
        segment_embeddings: List of segment embeddings (list of vectors).
        gate_values: List of gate values (list of floats).
        tagging_network: The primary tagging neural network.

    Returns:
        Probability distribution over labels (vector).
    """

    gated_segment_embeddings = []
    for i in range(len(segment_embeddings)):
        gated_embedding = segment_embeddings[i] * gate_values[i]  # Element-wise multiplication
        gated_segment_embeddings.append(gated_embedding)

    # Concatenate gated segment embeddings with token embedding
    combined_embedding = np.concatenate((token_embedding, *gated_segment_embeddings))

    # Pass through the primary tagging network
    label_probabilities = tagging_network(combined_embedding)

    return label_probabilities
```

**Innovation Rationale:**

This design overcomes the limitations of a fixed-order Markov model by allowing the system to dynamically adjust its 'memory' based on the current context. The contextual gating mechanism ensures that only relevant segments are considered, preventing information overload and improving efficiency. It's especially useful for long sequences where distant dependencies are important.
