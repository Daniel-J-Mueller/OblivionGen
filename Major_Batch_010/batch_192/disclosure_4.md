## Dynamic Load Anticipation & Pre-Staging

**Concept:** Proactively shift non-critical loads *before* a potential power disruption, not just reactively shed them. This goes beyond simple overload protection by anticipating demand spikes and pre-staging resources.

**Specs:**

*   **System Core:** A predictive analytics engine integrated with the data centerâ€™s power monitoring and workload management systems.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time power usage data (per rack, per server, per application).
    *   Historical workload patterns (daily, weekly, monthly).
    *   Scheduled maintenance windows.
    *   External event feeds (weather, grid alerts).
    *   Application priority/criticality metadata.
*   **Prediction Model:** Utilize a time series forecasting algorithm (e.g., LSTM recurrent neural network) trained on historical data. This model estimates future power demand with configurable prediction horizons (e.g., 5, 15, 30 minutes).
*   **Load Classification:**  Categorize all loads into:
    *   *Critical:*  Must remain operational at all costs.
    *   *Important:* Should remain operational if possible.
    *   *Deferrable:* Can be paused or migrated without significant impact.
*   **Pre-Staging Logic:**
    *   If the prediction model forecasts a potential overload within the prediction horizon, the system identifies deferrable loads.
    *   These loads are *proactively* migrated to systems powered by the reserve power system *before* an actual outage.
    *   Migration prioritizes loads based on recovery time and impact.
*   **Reserve Power System Integration:**
    *   The reserve power system capacity is treated as a 'staging area' for anticipated load.
    *   Pre-staged loads consume reserve power, reducing the required capacity during an actual outage.
*   **Automated Workload Migration:** Leverage containerization and virtualization technologies (e.g., Kubernetes, VMware) for seamless workload migration.
*   **Monitoring & Feedback:**  Continuously monitor the accuracy of the prediction model and adjust parameters accordingly. Track the effectiveness of pre-staging in reducing outage impact.
*   **Alerting:** Trigger alerts if the prediction model identifies a high probability of overload and pre-staging is insufficient.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
FUNCTION predict_power_demand(historical_data, current_data, event_feeds)
  // Time series forecasting (LSTM or similar)
  predicted_demand = FORECAST(historical_data, current_data, event_feeds)
  RETURN predicted_demand

FUNCTION identify_deferrable_loads(load_classification)
  deferrable_loads = SELECT * FROM load_classification WHERE criticality = "Deferrable"
  RETURN deferrable_loads

FUNCTION migrate_loads(deferrable_loads, reserve_power_system)
  FOR each load in deferrable_loads
    MOVE load TO reserve_power_system
  END FOR
  RETURN SUCCESS

FUNCTION monitor_and_adjust()
  // Calculate prediction accuracy
  accuracy = CALCULATE_ACCURACY(predicted_demand, actual_demand)
  // Adjust model parameters based on accuracy
  ADJUST_PARAMETERS(accuracy)

MAIN LOOP
  predicted_demand = predict_power_demand()
  IF predicted_demand > capacity
    deferrable_loads = identify_deferrable_loads()
    migrate_loads(deferrable_loads)
  END IF
  monitor_and_adjust()
END LOOP
