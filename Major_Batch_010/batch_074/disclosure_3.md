## Dynamic Object Authentication & Micro-Payment Network

**Concept:** Expanding beyond static object association with a payment amount, this system creates a dynamic, networked authentication and micro-payment system leveraging the 3D contour recognition described in the patent. Imagine ‘smart dust’ level interactions – a user doesn't *redeem* a full payment, but triggers micro-payments based on interaction with the authenticated object.

**Specs:**

1.  **Networked Object Registry:** A distributed ledger (blockchain or similar) stores 3D contour data (“object signatures”) and associated metadata. Each object signature is linked to a ‘contract’ defining permitted interactions and associated micro-payment amounts. This is *not* about a fixed price, but a price *per interaction*.
2.  **Proximity-Based Interaction Detection:**  User devices (phones, wearables) equipped with depth sensors (LiDAR, structured light) continually scan the environment. When a registered object is detected, the system analyzes the captured 3D data and matches it against the registry.  A confidence score is generated based on the similarity between captured and registered contour data.
3.  **Interaction Definition Engine:** A server-side component allows ‘owners’ (creators, brands) to define interactions and associated payment triggers. Examples:
    *   **Physical Touch:**  A user touching a branded display triggers a small payment to the brand.
    *   **Proximity Dwell Time:** Spending a certain amount of time near an art installation triggers a payment to the artist.
    *   **Gesture Recognition:** Specific gestures performed near the object trigger different payments (e.g., a ‘like’ gesture on a physical product).
    *   **Object Manipulation:** Picking up or moving an object initiates a payment (useful for rental systems).
4.  **Micro-Payment System:** Integrated with a digital wallet, the system automatically triggers micro-payments based on interaction events. Transactions are validated through the network, ensuring accuracy and security.
5.  **Dynamic Contour Adjustment:** The system allows for *controlled* degradation of the 3D contour for authentication. For example, an object could be designed with slight imperfections that change over time. The authentication process accounts for these changes, increasing security and preventing replication.
6.  **API & SDK:** Provide APIs and SDKs for developers to integrate the system into their applications and hardware. Enable custom interaction definitions and integration with existing micro-payment platforms.

**Pseudocode (Interaction Validation):**

```
FUNCTION ValidateInteraction(userDevice, objectID, interactionType)
    1. Capture 3D Contour Data from userDevice's depth sensor
    2. Retrieve Registered Contour Data for objectID from Networked Registry
    3. Calculate Similarity Score between Captured and Registered Contours
    4. IF Similarity Score > Threshold THEN
        5. Retrieve Interaction Definition for interactionType and objectID
        6. IF Interaction Definition is valid THEN
            7. Calculate Payment Amount based on Interaction Definition
            8. Initiate Micro-Payment Transaction
            9. Return Success
        ELSE
            10. Return Invalid Interaction
    ELSE
        11. Return Authentication Failure
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
