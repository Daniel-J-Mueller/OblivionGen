## Modular Sensory Array - "Chameleon"

**Concept:** Expand the device's environmental awareness beyond visual and auditory input by integrating a dynamically configurable array of chemical and tactile sensors. The device actively "samples" its environment, building a real-time sensory profile.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Modules:**
    *   Miniaturized electrochemical sensors (e-noses) for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs), gases (CO2, methane), and trace chemicals. Modular – hot-swappable.
    *   Tactile sensor array: Piezoelectric or capacitive sensors mimicking human skin, capable of detecting pressure, texture, and temperature. Flexible, conforming to device surfaces.
    *   Micro-spectrometer module: For rapid material identification via light reflectance analysis.
*   **Integration:**
    *   Sensor modules housed in removable "capsules" which magnetically attach to designated points on the device housing (top, bottom, sides).
    *   Power & data transmission: Wireless charging and high-speed data link (UWB or similar) to the core processing unit.
    *   Dedicated processing unit within the device manages sensor data acquisition, calibration, and analysis.
*   **Software & Functionality:**
    *   "Sensory Profile" Generation: Core algorithm constructs a multi-dimensional sensory profile of the surrounding environment, tagging location data and timestamps.
    *   "Environmental Mapping": Real-time rendering of the sensory profile as an overlaid visualization on the device display (AR mode).
    *   Contextual Awareness: Integration with AI/ML models for pattern recognition (e.g., identifying spoiled food, detecting hazardous gas leaks, mapping indoor air quality).
    *   User-defined “Sensory Alerts”: Customizable triggers for notifications based on specific sensor readings.
*   **Hardware Components:**
    *   Modular sensor capsules (dimensions: 10mm x 10mm x 5mm)
    *   Magnetic attachment mechanism (Neodymium magnets)
    *   Wireless charging coil
    *   UWB transceiver
    *   Low-power microcontroller
    *   Integrated sensor drivers
*   **Pseudocode (Environmental Mapping):**

```
// Initialize sensor data array
sensorData[x, y, z] = 0;

// Function: AcquireSensorData()
//    Reads data from all connected sensors.
//    Stores data in sensorData array, indexed by sensor type and location.

// Function: ProcessSensorData()
//    Applies calibration and filtering algorithms to raw sensor data.
//    Normalizes data to a common scale.

// Function: RenderEnvironmentalMap()
//    Creates a 3D visualization of the sensor data.
//    Uses color mapping to represent different sensor values.
//    Overlays visualization onto the device display (AR mode).
