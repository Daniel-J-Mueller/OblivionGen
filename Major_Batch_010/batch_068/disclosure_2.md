## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Reconstruction for Personalized Echo Cancellation

**Concept:** Extend the multi-layer echo cancellation system to not just *cancel* echo, but to *reconstruct* the acoustic scene, allowing for personalized audio experiences and improved echo cancellation in complex environments. The core idea is to move beyond simply removing the echo and instead creating a model of the room's acoustics *and* the userâ€™s preferred sound signature.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Microphone Array:**  Minimum 4-microphone array (linear or circular) integrated into the communication device.  High SNR microphones are critical.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) with sufficient compute for real-time acoustic modeling and signal processing.
*   **Speaker System:**  Stereo or multi-channel speaker system for rendering the processed audio and potentially generating localized audio effects.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Analyzer (ASA):**  This module processes the microphone array input to generate a real-time acoustic scene map. 
    *   **Input:** Microphone array data.
    *   **Process:** Utilizes techniques like beamforming, sound source localization, and reverberation time estimation to identify sound sources, their positions, and the room's acoustic properties (RT60, absorption coefficients, etc.).  A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large dataset of acoustic scenes would be the core of this module.
    *   **Output:** A 3D acoustic scene map represented as a volumetric grid, indicating sound source positions, intensities, and room impulse responses (RIRs).

*   **Personalized Audio Profile (PAP):**  Stores the user's preferred audio settings and acoustic preferences. 
    *   **Data:**  EQ settings, preferred reverb levels, preferred spatialization cues (e.g., widening, localization), and historical acoustic scene preferences.
    *   **Learning:**  PAP adapts over time based on user feedback and listening habits. Reinforcement learning could be used to optimize the audio settings for a given acoustic scene.

*   **Echo Cancellation & Acoustic Scene Synthesis (ECASS):**  The core processing module.
    *   **Input:** Microphone array data, reference signal from the remote party, acoustic scene map, personalized audio profile.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  **Initial Echo Cancellation:**  Utilizes a multi-layer neural network similar to the original patent. The first layer handles clock skew and speaker non-linearities. The second layer handles echo cancellation.
        2.  **Acoustic Scene Modeling:** The ECASS incorporates the acoustic scene map into its processing. Specifically, the RIRs from the ASA are used to model the acoustic path between the speaker and the microphones. This allows for more accurate echo cancellation, especially in reverberant environments.
        3.  **Personalized Audio Synthesis:** Based on the PAP and the acoustic scene model, the ECASS synthesizes the desired audio output. This involves:
            *   Applying the user's EQ settings and reverb preferences.
            *   Spatializing the audio to create a more immersive listening experience.  Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) could be used to create a realistic 3D soundscape.
            *   Adjusting the audio output to compensate for the room's acoustics.

    *   **Output:** Processed audio signal for playback.

**III.  Pseudocode for ECASS Module:**

```pseudocode
function process_audio(mic_data, ref_signal, acoustic_scene_map, pap):
  // Stage 1: Initial Echo Cancellation
  echo_cancelled_signal = multilayer_neural_network(mic_data, ref_signal)

  // Stage 2: Acoustic Scene Modeling
  rir = acoustic_scene_map.get_room_impulse_response()
  
  // Stage 3: Personalized Audio Synthesis
  eq_settings = pap.get_eq_settings()
  reverb_level = pap.get_reverb_level()
  spatialization_cues = pap.get_spatialization_cues()
  
  // Apply EQ
  equalized_signal = apply_eq(echo_cancelled_signal, eq_settings)
  
  // Add reverb
  reverberated_signal = apply_reverb(equalized_signal, reverb_level, rir)
  
  // Spatialization
  spatialized_signal = apply_spatialization(reverberated_signal, spatialization_cues)
  
  return spatialized_signal
```

**IV.  Training and Adaptation:**

*   The acoustic scene analyzer (ASA) would be pre-trained on a large dataset of acoustic scenes.
*   The multi-layer neural network (echo cancellation) would be trained on a dataset of echoic recordings.
*   The personalized audio profile (PAP) would adapt over time based on user feedback.
*   Online adaptation algorithms (e.g., recursive least squares) could be used to refine the echo cancellation model and personalize the audio output in real-time.

**Potential Applications:**

*   High-fidelity video conferencing
*   Immersive audio experiences
*   Personalized voice assistants
*   Augmented reality audio applications
