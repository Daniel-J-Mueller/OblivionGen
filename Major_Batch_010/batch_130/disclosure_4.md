## Decentralized Key Derivation with Ephemeral Message Containers

**Concept:** Extend the server-side encryption system by decoupling key management from a central Key Management Service (KMS) and tying it to short-lived, decentralized message containers. This enhances both security and scalability.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Ephemeral Container Creation:**
    *   Upon initial message send/receive request, a new, temporary message container is created. This container exists only for a predetermined duration (e.g., 24 hours, or until message delivery confirmation).
    *   Container creation is handled by a distributed consensus mechanism (e.g., a lightweight blockchain or DAG).
    *   Container metadata (creation time, expiration time, associated user IDs) is stored on the consensus network.

2.  **Key Derivation via Sharded Entropy:**
    *   Each ephemeral container is assigned a unique identifier (ContainerID).
    *   Instead of requesting a data encryption key from a KMS, a key is *derived* deterministically using the ContainerID, sender/receiver IDs, and a shard of entropy contributed by multiple, randomly selected nodes in the network. 
    *   Entropy nodes are chosen via Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to ensure selection is unpredictable and unbiased.
    *   Key derivation function: `DataEncryptionKey = KDF(ContainerID + SenderID + ReceiverID + EntropyShard)`.

3.  **Key Distribution & Encryption:**
    *   Entropy Shards are exchanged directly between sender, receiver, and contributing nodes using authenticated channels.
    *   Each party calculates the `DataEncryptionKey` independently.  No central key is ever transmitted.
    *   Messages are encrypted using the derived key and transmitted.

4.  **Container Expiration & Key Destruction:**
    *   Upon container expiration, the derived key is automatically rendered useless. The `ContainerID` is marked as invalid on the consensus network. 
    *   Any attempts to decrypt messages with a "stale" `ContainerID` will fail.
    *   Entropy shards are discarded.

5.  **Auditing & Non-Repudiation:**
    *   The consensus network provides an immutable audit trail of container creation, expiration, and participant node selections. 
    *   This allows for verification of message integrity and non-repudiation.

**Pseudocode (Key Derivation):**

```
function DeriveDataEncryptionKey(ContainerID, SenderID, ReceiverID, EntropyShard):
  CombinedString = ContainerID + SenderID + ReceiverID + EntropyShard
  DataEncryptionKey = KDF(CombinedString) // KDF = Key Derivation Function (e.g., HKDF-SHA256)
  return DataEncryptionKey
```

**System Components:**

*   **Container Manager:** Responsible for creating, managing, and expiring ephemeral containers.
*   **Entropy Coordinator:** Facilitates the selection and communication of entropy nodes.
*   **Consensus Network:** Provides a distributed ledger for container metadata and audit trails.
*   **Message Handlers:** Integrate with the system to encrypt/decrypt messages using derived keys.
