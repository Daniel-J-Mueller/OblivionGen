## Secure Attestation-Driven Resource Orchestration for Ephemeral Environments

**Specification:** A system dynamically creating and destroying compute resources (VMs, containers, serverless functions) based on attested properties *and* predicted resource needs. This goes beyond simple validation of existing attributes – it proactively shapes the environment *before* resource allocation.

**Core Concept:** Leverage attested properties (as provided by the existing patent) not just for permissioning, but as inputs to a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that governs resource provisioning.

**Components:**

1.  **Attestation Service:**  (Existing patent's core functionality) – Provides attested attributes of the requesting entity/workflow. Output includes a confidence score for each attribute.
2.  **RL Agent (Resource Orchestrator):** This is the novel component. Trained to optimize for cost, performance, and security. Inputs:
    *   Attested Attributes (from Attestation Service) – User ID, role, security clearance, application requirements, data sensitivity level, etc.
    *   Historical Performance Data –  Resource usage patterns of similar workflows/users.
    *   Real-time System Load –  Current availability of compute resources.
    *   Predicted Workload –  Based on attested application requirements and historical data.
3.  **Resource Provisioning Engine:**  Interfaces with cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premise infrastructure to allocate resources.  Receives orchestration directives from the RL Agent.
4.  **Ephemeral Environment Manager:** Responsible for the lifecycle of the created resources - scaling, monitoring, and automated destruction when the task completes.
5. **Dynamic Policy Engine:** Translates attested attributes into fine-grained resource policies (CPU limits, memory allocation, network access controls, data encryption levels).

**Workflow:**

1.  A request for a compute resource is initiated.
2.  The Attestation Service verifies the identity and attributes of the requestor.
3.  The RL Agent receives the attested attributes, historical data, and system load.
4.  The RL Agent predicts the optimal resource configuration (instance type, number of instances, network topology, security settings).
5.  The Dynamic Policy Engine generates granular resource policies based on the predicted configuration and attested attributes.
6.  The Resource Provisioning Engine allocates resources and applies the policies.
7.  The Ephemeral Environment Manager manages the lifecycle of the resources.
8.  Upon completion, the resources are automatically destroyed.

**Pseudocode (RL Agent - Simplified):**

```
function select_resource_config(attested_attributes, historical_data, system_load):
  state = (attested_attributes, historical_data, system_load)
  q_values = q_network(state) // Neural network predicting reward for each config
  best_config = argmax(q_values)

  return best_config

function update_q_network(state, action, reward, next_state):
  predicted_q = q_network(state)
  target_q = reward + discount_factor * max(q_network(next_state))
  loss = (target_q - predicted_q)^2
  q_network.train(loss)
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simply validating existing attributes to proactively shaping the compute environment *based* on those attributes and predicted needs.  The RL agent enables dynamic optimization of resource allocation, leading to improved cost efficiency, performance, and security. The integration of dynamic policies ensures granular control over resource access. The system’s predictive capabilities allow for pre-emptive resource allocation, reducing latency and improving responsiveness.
