## Adaptive Privilege Drift Detection via Behavioral Profiling

**Specification:** A system to detect privilege escalation *attempts*, not just successes, by establishing behavioral baselines and identifying anomalous access patterns. This builds on the fuzzy hashing concept by focusing on *how* a user interacts with a system, rather than just *what* they access.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Profiler:** Monitors user activity (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, time spent on pages, navigation patterns, command-line history, API call sequences).
*   **Baseline Generator:** Establishes normal behavior profiles for individual users/entities based on historical data. Uses statistical methods (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Bayesian Networks) to model typical sequences of actions.
*   **Anomaly Detector:** Compares current user activity against their established baseline. Calculates an "anomaly score" based on deviations from expected behavior.
*   **Fuzzy Hash Integration:**  Integrates with the existing fuzzy hashing system. Instead of just comparing responses, *request* payloads and system call arguments are fuzzy hashed.  Significant deviations in hashed request patterns, combined with behavioral anomalies, trigger alerts.
*   **Privilege Drift Indicator:**  Tracks changes in anomaly scores over time. A sustained increase in the anomaly score indicates potential privilege drift – an entity attempting actions outside its normal scope.
*   **Adaptive Thresholding:**  Dynamically adjusts anomaly score thresholds based on user roles and system context. Reduces false positives.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
Establish Baseline(UserID, historical_activity_data) -> UserProfile

//Real-time Monitoring
While(SessionActive) {
    current_activity = CaptureUserActivity()
    activity_hash = FuzzyHash(current_activity)
    anomaly_score = CalculateAnomalyScore(current_activity, UserProfile)
    
    If (anomaly_score > AdaptiveThreshold(UserID, SystemContext)) {
        LogAnomaly(UserID, anomaly_score, current_activity)
        
        If (SustainedAnomaly(UserID, anomaly_score)) {
            AlertPrivilegeDrift(UserID)
        }
    }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **UserProfile:** Contains baseline behavioral models, user role, system permissions, historical activity data.
*   **ActivityLog:** Stores timestamps, user IDs, anomaly scores, and activity details.

**Novelty:**

This shifts the focus from detecting *successful* privilege escalations to proactively identifying *attempts* based on behavioral deviations. It’s an early warning system. The integration with fuzzy hashing adds another layer of analysis – unexpected request patterns trigger suspicion.  It’s not simply about accessing forbidden resources; it’s about *how* an entity tries to access them.  It moves away from static signature matching to dynamic behavioral analysis.
