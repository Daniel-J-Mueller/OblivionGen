## Dynamic Spectrum Allocation via Predictive Frame Aggregation

**Specification:** Wireless device incorporating a predictive frame aggregation system with dynamic spectrum allocation based on environmental RF fingerprinting.

**Core Concept:** Instead of simply *reacting* to channel congestion, the device *predicts* future congestion based on learned RF patterns and proactively adjusts frame aggregation counts and even switches between available spectrum bands before congestion impacts throughput.

**Components:**

*   **RF Fingerprinting Module:** Continuously scans the RF environment, logging signal strength, interference levels, and identified protocols across multiple frequency bands. This data is used to build a historical "RF fingerprint" for the device's location. The module must be able to identify transient RF events (e.g., microwave oven operation) and classify them.
*   **Predictive Analytics Engine:** A machine learning model trained on the RF fingerprint data to predict short-term (seconds-level) channel congestion. Input features include time of day, day of week, location data, and the historical RF fingerprint. The output is a probability distribution of congestion levels for each available frequency band.
*   **Dynamic Frame Aggregation Controller:** This component manages the frame aggregation count for both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi transmissions. It receives the congestion predictions from the Predictive Analytics Engine and dynamically adjusts the frame aggregation count *before* a transmission block begins. Higher predicted congestion leads to reduced frame aggregation (shorter packets, lower latency), while lower congestion allows for increased aggregation (longer packets, higher throughput). The controller should prioritize consistent latency over raw throughput.
*   **Adaptive Spectrum Manager:** If the Predictive Analytics Engine forecasts severe congestion across all channels within a defined timeframe, the Adaptive Spectrum Manager initiates a switch to a less congested frequency band. This switch must be seamless to the user and application, utilizing background scanning and handover mechanisms.
*   **Data Logging & Model Retraining:** Continuously logs transmission performance data (throughput, latency, packet loss) alongside the RF fingerprint and prediction accuracy. This data is used to periodically retrain the Predictive Analytics Engine, improving its accuracy over time.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Frame Aggregation Controller):**

```
FUNCTION adjustFrameAggregation(predictedCongestionProbability, currentAggregationCount):
  IF predictedCongestionProbability > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
    newAggregationCount = MAX(1, currentAggregationCount - 1) //Reduce Aggregation
  ELSE IF predictedCongestionProbability < LOW_THRESHOLD:
    newAggregationCount = MIN(MAX_AGGREGATION, currentAggregationCount + 1) //Increase Aggregation
  ELSE:
    newAggregationCount = currentAggregationCount //Maintain Current Aggregation

  RETURN newAggregationCount
END FUNCTION

//Within Transmission Block Initiation Routine:
predictedCongestion = PredictiveAnalyticsEngine.getCongestionProbability(currentFrequencyBand)
newAggregationCount = adjustFrameAggregation(predictedCongestion, currentAggregationCount)
setFrameAggregationCount(newAggregationCount)
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Frequency Bands:** Support for 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz Wi-Fi bands, and Bluetooth 2.4 GHz band.
*   **Machine Learning Model:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network preferred for time-series prediction.
*   **Data Logging:** Store at least 7 days of RF fingerprint and performance data.
*   **Handover Time:** Seamless handover between frequency bands with less than 50ms interruption.
*   **Power Consumption:** Optimized for mobile devices; minimal impact on battery life.
*   **Security:** Secure data logging and model retraining to prevent malicious interference.
