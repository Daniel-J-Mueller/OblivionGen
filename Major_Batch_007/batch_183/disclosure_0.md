## Adaptive Fault Injection Based on Service DNA

**Specification:** A system for dynamically profiling and injecting faults based on a “Service DNA” model, going beyond random failures to target vulnerabilities based on service behavior and dependencies.

**Core Concept:**  Each virtualized service maintains a "Service DNA" profile – a real-time graph representing its internal component interactions, data flow, and resource dependencies. This DNA is built and updated through continuous observation of service execution. The fault injection service doesn’t just *randomly* fail requests; it analyzes the Service DNA to inject faults that specifically target critical paths, dependencies, and potential failure points.

**Components:**

1.  **Service DNA Profiler:** A lightweight agent deployed alongside each virtualized service.
    *   Continuously monitors service execution (API calls, internal function calls, data transfers, resource usage).
    *   Constructs and maintains a directed graph representing the service’s internal structure and dependencies. Nodes represent components or functions, edges represent data flow or control flow.
    *   Dynamically updates the graph based on runtime behavior, identifying frequently used paths, critical dependencies, and potential bottlenecks.
2.  **Fault Injection Orchestrator:**  The central control point for fault injection.
    *   Receives requests for fault injection tests (including high-level goals like "test resilience to database outages" or "verify handling of invalid input").
    *   Queries the Service DNA profiles of the target services to identify critical paths and dependencies.
    *   Generates a sequence of targeted faults based on the test goals and the Service DNA analysis.  Faults can include:
        *   **Request Blocking:** As in the existing patent, but *targeted* to specific requests traversing critical paths.
        *   **Data Corruption:** Modifying input parameters or return values based on the Service DNA (e.g., corrupting a value known to be used in a critical calculation).
        *   **Dependency Injection:**  Simulating the failure of dependent services or resources (e.g., replacing a database with a mock that returns errors).
        *   **Latency Injection:** Introducing artificial delays to specific components to simulate network congestion or resource contention.
        * **State Injection:**  Changing the internal state of a service component to trigger specific error conditions.
    *   Executes the fault injection sequence and monitors the service’s response.
3. **Response Analyzer:** Component that evaluates service responses to injected faults. This includes measuring error rates, latency, and resource utilization.

**Pseudocode (Fault Injection Orchestrator):**

```
function injectFaults(serviceName, testGoal, parameters):
  dna = getServiceDNA(serviceName)
  criticalPath = findCriticalPath(dna, testGoal)
  faultSequence = generateFaultSequence(criticalPath, parameters)

  for fault in faultSequence:
    applyFault(fault)
    monitorServiceResponse()
  end for

  reportResults()
end function

function generateFaultSequence(criticalPath, parameters):
  sequence = []
  for node in criticalPath:
    if parameters.injectLatency:
      sequence.append(injectLatencyFault(node))
    if parameters.corruptData:
      sequence.append(corruptDataFault(node))
    // more fault types...
  end for
  return sequence
end function
```

**Innovation:**

*   **Targeted Fault Injection:**  Moves beyond random failures to focus on vulnerabilities within the service's actual execution graph.
*   **Dynamic Profiling:** The Service DNA is continuously updated, adapting to changes in service behavior and dependencies.
*   **Adaptive Faulting:** The system can learn from previous fault injection tests, prioritizing areas of high risk or previously uncovered vulnerabilities.
*   **Automated Vulnerability Discovery:**  By systematically injecting faults along critical paths, the system can help identify potential failure points and vulnerabilities before they impact production.
