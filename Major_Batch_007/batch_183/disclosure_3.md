## Dynamic Scene Complexity Mapping & Adaptive Subspace Selection

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of projecting scene points onto vector subspaces to *dynamically* assess scene complexity and adapt subspace generation accordingly. This allows for more robust foreground detection in challenging scenarios – especially those with motion blur, rapidly changing scenes, or complex textures.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Scene Complexity Metric:**
    *   Define a “Scene Complexity Score (SCS)” for each section of the frame. This is calculated based on the *variance* of projection errors across all scene points within that section. High variance = high complexity.
    *   SCS = StandardDeviation(ProjectionErrors) / Mean(ProjectionErrors).  This normalized variance provides a scale-invariant measure of complexity.
2.  **Adaptive Subspace Generation:**
    *   **Complexity Thresholds:** Define thresholds (Low, Medium, High) for SCS.
    *   **Subspace Dimensionality Adjustment:**
        *   **Low SCS:** Use 3 basis vectors (as in the patent).
        *   **Medium SCS:** Use 4 basis vectors.
        *   **High SCS:** Use 5+ basis vectors, potentially using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine optimal dimensionality for the subspace based on scene point trajectories.
    *   **Basis Vector Selection Enhancement:**
        *   Instead of *randomly* selecting basis vectors, prioritize those with the highest average trajectory length within the section. This helps capture dominant motion patterns.
        *   Implement a “basis vector diversity” metric. Penalize selection of basis vectors that are highly correlated with each other.
3.  **Temporal Smoothing:**
    *   Apply a moving average filter to SCS values across consecutive frames. This reduces flickering and improves stability in dynamic scenes.
    *   Smoothly transition between subspace dimensionality settings over multiple frames to avoid abrupt changes.
4.  **Foreground Refinement via Subspace Residual Analysis:**
    *   After initial foreground detection (based on projection error threshold), analyze the *residual error* – the difference between the actual scene point and its projection onto the subspace.
    *   High residual error, even for points *below* the initial threshold, may indicate genuine foreground elements obscured by noise or complex motion.
    *   Apply a secondary, lower threshold to the residual error to refine the foreground mask.

**Pseudocode (Core Loop - Per Frame, Per Section):**

```
FOR each section in frame:
    // Calculate Scene Complexity Score (SCS)
    projection_errors = []
    FOR each scene_point in section:
        projection_error = calculate_projection_error(scene_point, subspace)
        projection_errors.append(projection_error)
    SCS = standard_deviation(projection_errors) / mean(projection_errors)

    // Temporal Smoothing
    smoothed_SCS = moving_average_filter(SCS, previous_smoothed_SCS)

    // Adaptive Subspace Generation
    IF smoothed_SCS < Low_Threshold:
        subspace_dimensionality = 3
    ELSE IF smoothed_SCS < Medium_Threshold:
        subspace_dimensionality = 4
    ELSE:
        subspace_dimensionality = 5 + PCA(scene_point_trajectories) // Determine dimensionality from data

    basis_vectors = select_basis_vectors(scene_point_trajectories, subspace_dimensionality) //Prioritize long, diverse trajectories

    // Foreground Detection (as in patent)
    FOR each scene_point in section:
        projection_error = calculate_projection_error(scene_point, basis_vectors)
        IF projection_error > error_threshold:
            mark_pixel_as_foreground()

    //Residual Error Refinement
    FOR each scene_point in section:
        residual_error = calculate_residual_error(scene_point, basis_vectors)
        IF residual_error > residual_threshold:
            mark_pixel_as_foreground()
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   GPU acceleration for subspace calculations and projection error determination.
*   Sufficient memory to store scene point trajectories and subspaces.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved foreground detection accuracy in complex scenes.
*   Robustness to motion blur and rapid scene changes.
*   Adaptive resource utilization based on scene complexity.
