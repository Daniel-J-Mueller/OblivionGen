## Adaptive Rule Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Extend the genetic rule generation process by incorporating a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to individual rule conditions *within* accepted rulesets. This moves beyond simply selecting good rules to optimizing *how* those rules are applied, adapting to evolving data patterns and edge cases.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** An RL agent (e.g., using a Deep Q-Network or Policy Gradient method) integrated into the duplicate detection pipeline.
*   **State Representation:** The RL agent’s state will be a vector summarizing characteristics of the item description information being compared. This includes:
    *   Token counts
    *   N-gram frequencies (e.g., bigrams, trigrams)
    *   Presence/absence of specific keywords/entities
    *   Edit distance between the strings
    *   Confidence scores from any pre-processing NLP models (e.g., sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging)
*   **Action Space:** The agent’s actions involve adjusting the weights assigned to each independent rule condition *within* an accepted rule.  For example, if a rule has conditions based on title, description, and price, the agent can increase or decrease the influence of each condition on the final duplicate score. Action granularity: +/- 0.05 weighting increment, capped at 0-1.
*   **Reward Function:** The reward signal is derived from feedback on duplicate detection accuracy. This can be:
    *   **Positive Reward:**  Given when a correctly identified duplicate is confirmed by a human reviewer.
    *   **Negative Reward:** Given when an incorrect duplicate identification is flagged by a human reviewer (false positive).
    *   **Intermediate Reward:** A smaller reward based on the confidence score of the duplicate detection engine *before* human review. This helps speed up learning.
*   **Training Procedure:**
    1.  The genetic algorithm generates a population of candidate rules.
    2.  The best rules (based on precision/recall) are selected.
    3.  The RL agent is initialized and trained *online* while the duplicate detection pipeline is running. The RL agent receives state information and takes actions to adjust rule weights.
    4.  Human review provides feedback, which is used to update the RL agent’s policy and further refine rule weights.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   Duplicate Detection Engine (receives item descriptions)
    *   Genetic Rule Generator (outputs accepted rules)
    *   RL Agent (modifies rule weights dynamically)
    *   Human Review Queue (provides feedback)
    *   Data Store (stores item descriptions, duplicate flags, RL agent training data)
*   **Pseudocode (RL Agent Step):**

```
function step(state, rule_set):
  action = agent.select_action(state) // e.g., adjust weight of condition X by 0.05
  new_rule_set = apply_action(rule_set, action)
  duplicate_score = calculate_duplicate_score(item_descriptions, new_rule_set)
  reward = get_reward(duplicate_score, human_feedback)
  agent.update_policy(state, action, reward)
  return new_rule_set
```

**Novelty:** This extends static rule selection to dynamic rule weighting, adapting to data drift and edge cases that a fixed ruleset might miss.  It combines the evolutionary power of genetic algorithms with the adaptive learning of reinforcement learning, creating a more robust and intelligent duplicate detection system.  The direct integration of human feedback into the RL loop enables continuous improvement and ensures alignment with subjective quality standards.
