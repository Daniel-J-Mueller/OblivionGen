## Adaptive Credential Chains for Event-Driven Architectures

**Concept:** Extend the event-specific credential concept to a chained series of credentials, where each credential in the chain unlocks further processing or access within the event flow. This allows for granular, dynamically adjusted permissions *during* event processing, not just at initiation.

**Specification:**

**1. Component: Credential Chain Manager (CCM)**

*   **Function:** Orchestrates the creation, validation, and sequencing of credentials within an event flow.  Resides within the resource provider environment.
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Registered Function Definition: Contains metadata about required access, potential credential chain paths, and acceptable credential types.
    *   Triggering Event: Data associated with the event, including event type, source, and relevant attributes.
    *   Initial Base Credential:  The starting point for credential authorization.
    *   Chain Definition Files: Define acceptable credential chains for a registered function.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Validated Credential Chain: Sequence of credentials to be used for event processing.
    *   Error/Warning Signals:  Indicates issues with chain validation or credential acquisition.

**2. Chain Definition File Format (JSON)**

```json
{
  "function_id": "function_x",
  "chain_paths": [
    {
      "path_id": "path_1",
      "trigger_condition": "{event_type: 'data_upload', file_size > 10MB}",  // Example condition
      "credential_type": "read_data_lake",
      "next_path": "path_2"
    },
    {
      "path_id": "path_2",
      "credential_type": "execute_ml_model",
      "final_path": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**3. Workflow Pseudocode:**

```
// Event Received
event_data = receive_event()

// Retrieve Registered Function and Chain Definition
function_def = get_function_definition(event_data.function_id)
chain_def = get_chain_definition(function_def.chain_id)

// Initialize Credential Chain
current_credential = function_def.initial_credential
current_path = chain_def.start_path

// Process Chain
while (current_path != null) {
  path_def = chain_def.get_path(current_path)

  // Evaluate Trigger Condition
  if (path_def.trigger_condition != null) {
    if (!evaluate_condition(path_def.trigger_condition, event_data)) {
      // Condition not met, try alternative path if available
      current_path = path_def.alternative_path
      continue
    }
  }

  // Acquire Next Credential
  next_credential = acquire_credential(path_def.credential_type, event_data, current_credential)

  // Validate Credential
  if (credential_validation_failed(next_credential)) {
    // Handle validation failure (e.g., log error, terminate event processing)
    break
  }

  // Update Current Credential
  current_credential = next_credential

  // Move to Next Path
  current_path = path_def.next_path

}

// Execute Registered Function with Final Credential
execute_function(function_def.code, event_data, current_credential)

// Clean up resources
delete_credentials()
```

**4. Credential Types:**

*   **Read Data Lake:** Allows access to data lake resources.
*   **Execute ML Model:**  Grants permission to execute machine learning models.
*   **Write to Database:** Enables writing data to a database.
*   **Invoke External API:** Permits calling external APIs.
*   **Custom Credential:**  Allows for the definition of custom credential types.

**5.  Security Considerations:**

*   Chain definitions must be securely stored and protected from unauthorized modification.
*   Credential acquisition should be performed using a trusted token service.
*   Regular auditing of chain definitions and credential usage is essential.
*   Implement rate limiting and access controls to prevent abuse.
