## Data ‘Shadowing’ and Predictive Error Mitigation

**Concept:** Extend the importance-based verification by creating a ‘shadow’ copy of critical data blocks *during* verification, and employ predictive error mitigation based on observed verification patterns and ‘shadow’ integrity.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on *detecting* errors. This aims to proactively *prevent* data loss by creating redundancy during verification and anticipating failures. If a block consistently exhibits verification issues, a fresh copy is already prepared.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow Buffer Allocation:**

*   Upon initiating a verification pass on a data block, allocate a corresponding ‘shadow’ buffer in a secondary storage location (SSD, different RAID array, remote server). The size of the shadow buffer equals the size of the original data block.
*   Allocation is managed by a ‘Shadow Manager’ service.

**2. Verification with Shadow Copying:**

*   During verification, *simultaneously* write the data from the original block to the allocated shadow buffer *before* the integrity check. This adds overhead, but ensures an immediate, verified copy exists.
*   If verification *passes*, mark the shadow buffer as ‘valid’ and retain it based on a retention policy (see Section 4).
*   If verification *fails*:
    *   Immediately switch data access to the shadow buffer (seamless failover).
    *   Initiate repair of the original block (e.g., RAID rebuild, error correction).

**3. Predictive Error Modeling:**

*   Collect verification data:
    *   Verification pass results (pass/fail)
    *   Verification time
    *   Error types (CRC errors, parity failures, etc.)
    *   Access frequency of the data block.
*   Employ a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, time series analysis) to predict the probability of future verification failures for each data block.
*   The model incorporates access patterns – frequently accessed blocks with a history of errors are flagged as high-risk.

**4. Retention Policy & Shadow Management:**

*   Shadow retention is dynamic, based on:
    *   Error prediction score: Higher scores = longer retention.
    *   Access frequency: Frequently accessed blocks retained longer.
    *   Storage capacity: Prioritize retention of critical, high-risk blocks.
*   The Shadow Manager service periodically audits shadow buffers:
    *   Deletes expired shadows.
    *   Initiates proactive ‘shadow refresh’ – copying the data from the current block to a new shadow buffer, even if no errors are detected, for particularly critical blocks.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// On Verification Pass Start (for each data block):

Allocate Shadow Buffer (size = block size)
Copy Data Block to Shadow Buffer
Verify Shadow Buffer Integrity

If (Shadow Buffer Integrity Check Fails):
  // Handle shadow allocation/copy failure (rare)
  Log Error & Retry

If (Data Block Verification Fails):
  Switch Data Access to Shadow Buffer
  Initiate Data Block Repair

// Background Process (Shadow Manager):

For Each Data Block:
  Predict Error Probability (using ML model)
  Determine Shadow Retention Period (based on prediction, access frequency, storage capacity)
  If (Shadow Expiration Date Reached):
    Delete Shadow
    // Optionally initiate Shadow Refresh if block is critical
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Sufficient secondary storage capacity for shadow buffers.
*   Fast I/O for shadow buffer creation and access.
*   Dedicated hardware acceleration for error correction/repair.
