## Predictive Stow Optimization & Dynamic Re-Slotting

**Concept:** Leverage the core predictive error detection from the provided patent to not just *detect* discrepancies, but proactively *optimize* stowage within the first package (the 'shipment') *during* the packing process, and dynamically re-slot items based on predicted error probabilities.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   `ShipmentID`: Unique identifier for the initial package.
    *   `VendorID`: Identifier of the item supplier.
    *   `ItemSKU`: Stock Keeping Unit of each item.
    *   `PredictedStowCount`: Initial predicted number of items/second packages for the shipment (from vendor manifest or pre-shipment data).
    *   `PhysicalDimensions`: Dimensions of the shipment container.
    *   `ItemDimensions`: Dimensions of each item/second package.
    *   `RealtimeScanData`: Continuous stream of scan data as items are stowed. Includes timestamp, ItemSKU, and location within the shipment (defined by a 3D coordinate system).
*   **Processing Modules:**
    1.  **Stowage Probability Engine:**
        *   Algorithm: Bayesian Network trained on historical stowage data, vendor performance, and item characteristics.
        *   Output: Probability score for each possible stowage location for each item. This incorporates prediction of potential error – an item difficult to identify, prone to damage, or historically miscounted will have a lower stowage probability in hard-to-reach locations.
    2.  **Dynamic Re-Slotting Module:**
        *   Algorithm: Optimization algorithm (e.g., Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing) that aims to maximize stowage probability across all items while respecting physical constraints (shipment dimensions, item fragility).
        *   Real-time Adjustment: As items are scanned, the module updates the stowage probabilities and dynamically suggests alternative stowage locations to the packer via a Heads-Up Display (HUD).
        *   Conflict Resolution: If a suggested location is already occupied, the module proposes a swap with a lower-probability item.
    3.  **Error Prediction Module:**
        *   Monitors the discrepancy between `PredictedStowCount` and the actual scanned count of second packages.
        *   Calculates a “Stowage Risk Score” based on the magnitude of the discrepancy and the historical error rate for the `VendorID`.
        *   Triggers alerts for high-risk shipments, prompting manual inspection.
*   **Output:**
    *   `OptimalStowagePlan`: 3D map of the shipment with recommended stowage locations for each item.
    *   `StowageRiskScore`: Real-time indication of the potential for receiving errors.
    *   `Alerts`: Notifications for high-risk shipments or potential stowage conflicts.
    *   `Data Logging`: Records all stowage decisions, scan data, and error predictions for historical analysis and model training.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Re-Slotting Module):**

```
function ReSlot(ItemSKU, ScanData):
  Location = FindBestLocation(ItemSKU, ScanData)
  if Location is occupied:
    SwapCandidate = FindLowestProbabilityItem(Location)
    if SwapCandidate is suitable:
      Swap(ItemSKU, SwapCandidate)
      UpdateStowagePlan(ItemSKU, SwapCandidate)
    else:
      Alert("Stowage Conflict - Manual Resolution Required")
  else:
    UpdateStowagePlan(ItemSKU, Location)
```

**Innovation:** This system isn't just about *detecting* errors after they happen; it's about *preventing* them by optimizing the stowage process itself. By incorporating predictive error probabilities into the re-slotting algorithm, we can proactively minimize the risk of receiving errors and improve overall supply chain efficiency. The system moves beyond basic error detection to an active intervention model.
