## Dynamic Magnetic Focusing Array

**Concept:** Expand the single magnet boosting concept to a dynamically adjustable array of micro-magnets integrated *within* the NFC antenna coil itself. This creates a steerable and focusable magnetic field, drastically increasing range and targeting specific reader locations, even through obstructions.

**Specs:**

*   **Antenna Construction:** Planar spiral coil constructed from high-conductivity copper, embedded in a multi-layer PCB.
*   **Micro-Magnet Array:** Array of 16x16 (256 total) micro-electromagnets, physically integrated *within* the windings of the planar spiral coil. Each micro-magnet is individually addressable. These are *not* permanent magnets, but controlled electromagnets. Size: 0.5mm x 0.5mm x 1mm each.
*   **Control System:** Dedicated microcontroller with PWM outputs for individual control of each micro-magnet.
*   **Sensing:** Capacitive proximity sensors embedded around the antenna perimeter to detect approaching NFC readers.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Initialization: Micro-magnets default to a neutral position (no field contribution).
    2.  Proximity Detection: Capacitive sensors trigger when an NFC reader approaches.
    3.  Beamforming: Algorithm calculates the optimal configuration of micro-magnet polarities and intensities to focus the magnetic field towards the detected reader location. This is essentially a miniature phased array.
    4.  Dynamic Adjustment: Algorithm continuously adjusts the micro-magnet configuration based on real-time reader movement and signal strength.
    5.  Obstruction Mitigation: Algorithm detects signal reflections (indicating obstructions) and adjusts the beamforming to bypass or penetrate the obstruction. Uses frequency analysis of reflected signals.
*   **Power:** Dedicated power management IC to supply individual micro-magnets with optimized current levels.
*   **Materials:** High permeability core material surrounding the coil and micro-magnet array to concentrate the magnetic flux.

**Pseudocode (Beamforming Algorithm):**

```
function calculate_magnet_configuration(reader_location, signal_strength, obstruction_data):
  magnet_array = initialize_magnet_array()
  
  for each magnet in magnet_array:
    distance = calculate_distance(magnet.location, reader_location)
    
    if distance < threshold:
      magnet.polarity = determine_polarity(magnet.location, reader_location)
      magnet.intensity = calculate_intensity(distance, signal_strength, obstruction_data)
    else:
      magnet.polarity = neutral
      magnet.intensity = 0
      
  return magnet_array

function determine_polarity(magnet_location, reader_location):
  // Algorithm to determine the optimal polarity (N or S) based on reader location
  // Uses vector math to align magnetic fields
  ...
  
function calculate_intensity(distance, signal_strength, obstruction_data):
  // Algorithm to calculate the optimal intensity based on distance, signal strength,
  // and obstruction data.  Uses PID control and potentially machine learning.
  ...
```

**Refinement:** Implement a learning algorithm to optimize the beamforming process based on real-world usage data.  The system could learn the typical reader locations in a given environment and proactively focus the magnetic field towards those locations.
