## Adaptive Network Mirage

**Concept:** Proactively generate and deploy ‘mirage’ virtual machines (VMs) configured to absorb and analyze attack traffic *before* it reaches production systems, dynamically adjusting the mirage’s configuration based on observed attack patterns. This goes beyond simply regulating bandwidth; it’s about creating a decoy network that learns and adapts to threats in real-time.

**Specs:**

*   **Mirage VM Pool:** A cluster of pre-configured, lightweight VMs with minimal essential services. These are the ‘decoys.’ Scalable via containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).
*   **Traffic Diversion Engine (TDE):**  A component integrated with network ingress points (routers, firewalls). The TDE intercepts a percentage of incoming traffic and redirects it to the Mirage VM pool.  Diversion percentage is dynamically adjustable.
*   **Attack Signature Analyzer (ASA):**  Each Mirage VM runs an ASA module. ASA employs machine learning models (trained on known attack vectors) to identify and classify attack traffic. Models are regularly updated via a central server.
*   **Dynamic Configuration Module (DCM):**  Based on ASA’s findings, the DCM adjusts the Mirage VM's configuration. This includes:
    *   **Service Emulation:** Spinning up/down services mimicking those targeted by the attack.
    *   **Vulnerability Injection:** Introducing deliberately vulnerable code to lure attackers and gather intelligence.
    *   **Data Injection:**  Seeding the Mirage VMs with fake data to mislead attackers.
*   **Feedback Loop to Production:**  The ASA and DCM share intelligence with production systems’ security infrastructure (IDS/IPS, firewalls). This enables proactive adjustments to production defenses.
*   **Self-Learning and Adaptation:**  The system continuously learns from observed attack patterns and refines its configuration and defense mechanisms.

**Pseudocode (DCM - Core Logic):**

```
function adjustMirageVM(vm, attackData) {
  // attackData contains details of the attack (e.g., protocol, target service, payload)

  if (attackData.protocol == "HTTP" && attackData.targetService == "webserver") {
    // Emulate vulnerable web application
    startWebserver(vm, "vulnerable_version_1.2");
    injectPayload(vm, "fake_credentials");
  } else if (attackData.protocol == "SSH" && attackData.targetService == "sshserver") {
    // Emulate SSH server with weak key exchange
    startSSHServer(vm, "weak_key_exchange");
  } else {
    // Default: generic vulnerability
    enableGenericVulnerability(vm);
  }

  // Log the changes
  logAdjustment(vm, attackData);
}

function enableGenericVulnerability(vm){
  //Implement a vulnerability that provides some insight into the attacker
  //E.g. a simple buffer overflow, a directory traversal vulnerability, etc.
}
```

**Innovation:** Traditional security focuses on blocking or mitigating attacks *after* they’re detected. This system proactively creates a realistic attack surface to divert attackers, study their methods, and adapt defenses *before* any real damage occurs. It's akin to setting up a honey pot network on steroids. The adaptive nature goes beyond static honey pots; it’s a dynamic, learning decoy.
