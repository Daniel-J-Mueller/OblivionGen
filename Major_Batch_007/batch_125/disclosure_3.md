## Adaptive Notification Zones & Biometric Authentication

**Concept:** Expand the location-based notification system to incorporate dynamic zones determined by user activity and biometric authentication for enhanced security and relevance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dynamic Zone Creation:**

*   **Activity Monitoring:** Integrate with device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS) to determine user activity – walking, running, driving, stationary.
*   **Zone Definition:** Based on activity, automatically define zones around the user.
    *   **Stationary:** Small radius (1-5 meters) – 'Personal Space' – for highly sensitive notifications.
    *   **Walking/Running:** Medium radius (10-30 meters) – 'Active Radius' – for fitness/health related alerts.
    *   **Driving:** Large radius (50-100 meters) – 'Transit Zone' – for traffic/route updates.
*   **Zone Persistence:** Zones should persist even if GPS signal is momentarily lost, using sensor fusion techniques.
*   **User Override:** Allow users to manually define or adjust zone sizes and types.

**2. Biometric Authentication for Notification Delivery:**

*   **Biometric Scan Trigger:** Upon entering a defined zone, initiate a biometric scan (fingerprint, facial recognition, voiceprint).
*   **Authentication Required:** Notification delivery is *only* permitted after successful biometric authentication.
*   **Multi-Factor Option:** Allow combining biometric authentication with PIN/password for increased security.
*   **Biometric Profile:** Store multiple biometric profiles per user (e.g., different fingerprints for different hands).
*   **Biometric Failure Handling:**
    *   **Retry:** Allow limited retries.
    *   **Alternative Delivery:** If authentication fails repeatedly, deliver notification to a pre-defined secondary device/contact.
    *   **Notification Suppression:** Option to suppress the notification entirely.

**3. Notification Prioritization & Filtering:**

*   **Biometric-Linked Priority:** Assign notification priority levels linked to biometric authentication success.
    *   **High Priority:** Critical alerts delivered *only* with successful biometric scan.
    *   **Medium Priority:** Alerts delivered after biometric scan or with PIN/password.
    *   **Low Priority:** Non-critical alerts delivered without authentication.
*   **Contextual Filtering:** Filter notifications based on user context (location, activity, time of day, calendar events).
*   **AI-Powered Relevance:** Utilize machine learning to predict user relevance and prioritize notifications accordingly.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Event: User enters defined zone

function handleZoneEntry(user, zone) {
  startBiometricScan(user);

  if (biometricScanSuccessful(user)) {
    deliverNotifications(user, zone, "High Priority");
  } else {
    // Attempt PIN/Password Verification
    if (pinPasswordSuccessful(user)) {
      deliverNotifications(user, zone, "Medium Priority");
    } else {
      // Suppress or redirect notification
      logFailedAuthentication(user);
      redirectNotification(user, "Secondary Contact");
    }
  }
}

function deliverNotifications(user, zone, priority) {
  // Filter notifications based on zone, priority, and user context
  filteredNotifications = getFilteredNotifications(user, zone, priority);

  // Deliver filtered notifications to user's device
  displayNotifications(user, filteredNotifications);
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Device with biometric scanner (fingerprint, facial recognition, voiceprint).
*   GPS module for location tracking.
*   Accelerometer and gyroscope for activity monitoring.
*   Secure enclave for biometric data storage and processing.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Operating system with biometric authentication APIs.
*   Location services framework.
*   Secure communication protocols for data transmission.
*   Machine learning libraries for AI-powered relevance filtering.
