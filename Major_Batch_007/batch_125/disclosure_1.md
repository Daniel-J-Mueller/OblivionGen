**Acoustic Holography with Dynamic Mesh Refinement**

**Core Concept:** Expand the acoustic decomposition beyond plane waves to full 3D spatial decomposition via acoustic holography, incorporating a dynamic mesh refinement system for localized high-resolution analysis. This moves beyond simply identifying *where* sounds come from to *reconstructing the sound field itself* in 3D with adaptive precision.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Sensor Array:** Utilize a dense, arbitrary-geometry microphone array. Not limited to planar or regular arrangements. The array will be the foundation for holographic reconstruction.
2.  **Initial Acoustic Field Estimation:**  Employ a spherical harmonics expansion to create a coarse, low-resolution 3D representation of the sound field. This serves as the initial “hologram”.
3.  **Error Metric:** Define an error metric based on the difference between observed microphone data and the sound field predicted by the current hologram. This is calculated continuously.
4.  **Dynamic Mesh Refinement:** Divide the 3D space into a hierarchical octree mesh.  Cells with high error (as determined by the error metric) are recursively subdivided, increasing the mesh density and thus the resolution of the hologram in those areas. Areas with low error remain coarsely meshed.
5.  **Decomposition within Refined Cells:** Within each refined cell, utilize the existing acoustic decomposition techniques (similar to the provided patent – focusing on localized plane wave analysis) to more accurately model the sound sources *within that cell*. The original plane wave decomposition is still used, but it is now applied to a localized volume rather than the entire space.
6.  **Optimization:** A multi-stage optimization process. First, optimize the mesh refinement based on global error. Second, optimize the plane wave decomposition *within* each refined cell. This can be done concurrently. Coordinate descent would be suitable for the localized decomposition.
7.  **Regularization:** Elastic net regularization can be used within the localized optimization to prevent overfitting, particularly in areas with sparse data.
8.  **Real-time Performance:** Implement the system with optimized code and potentially hardware acceleration (GPU) to achieve real-time or near-real-time reconstruction.
9.  **Output:** The system outputs a dynamic, volumetric representation of the sound field, including:
    *   Acoustic pressure values at any point in space.
    *   Estimated locations and strengths of sound sources.
    *   Visualizations of the reconstructed sound field (e.g., isosurfaces, color-coded pressure maps).

**Pseudocode (Core Algorithm):**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
Create initial octree mesh (coarse)
Estimate initial sound field (spherical harmonics)

// Main Loop
while (true):
    // 1. Error Calculation
    Calculate error between observed microphone data and estimated sound field

    // 2. Mesh Refinement
    Identify cells with high error
    Refine those cells (recursive subdivision)

    // 3. Localized Decomposition
    For each refined cell:
        Apply plane wave decomposition (as in the patent) to data within the cell
        Optimize plane wave coefficients using coordinate descent + elastic net

    // 4. Update Sound Field
    Reconstruct sound field from refined mesh and optimized coefficients
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Advanced noise cancellation and beamforming.
*   3D audio rendering and spatial sound reproduction.
*   Medical imaging and diagnostics (acoustic tomography).
*   Robotics and autonomous navigation (sound source localization).
*   Security and surveillance (acoustic event detection).
