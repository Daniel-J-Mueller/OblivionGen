## Dynamic Campaign Persona Generation & Multi-Sensory Delivery

**Concept:** Extend dynamic content delivery beyond simple functionality toggles (discount, redirection) to generate entire 'campaign personas' tailored to individual users *and* delivered via multiple sensory channels, creating a deeply immersive and personalized experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Core – Predictive Modeling:**

*   **Input:** Historical user data (browsing, purchase, app usage), real-time contextual data (location, weather, time of day, device type), and initial campaign goal.
*   **Process:** Employ a multi-layered predictive model (LSTM/Transformer architecture) to generate a ‘persona vector’. This vector represents a nuanced psychological profile, including:
    *   Dominant emotional state (joy, anxiety, curiosity).
    *   Preferred communication style (visual, auditory, tactile).
    *   Core values/interests.
    *   Likelihood to respond to specific creative themes.
*   **Output:** A dynamic persona vector, refreshed in real-time with each user interaction.

**2. Multi-Sensory Content Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Persona vector, campaign goal, product information.
*   **Process:** Based on the persona vector, automatically generate content across multiple sensory channels:
    *   **Visual:** Dynamic image/video generation (GANs) focusing on colors, imagery, and aesthetic styles appealing to the user’s profile.
    *   **Auditory:**  AI-composed music/soundscapes tailored to emotional state.  Voiceover generation with personalized tone/accent.
    *   **Haptic:** (Requires compatible devices – smartwatches, wearables, haptic feedback suits). Generate patterns/intensities of vibrations that align with the emotional tone of the campaign.  Example: Gentle pulsations for relaxation, quick bursts for excitement.
    *   **Olfactory:** (Requires compatible devices – smart diffusers).  Generate scent profiles matching the emotional state.  Example: Lavender for relaxation, citrus for energy.
*   **Output:** A ‘sensory package’ – coordinated content designed for simultaneous delivery across multiple channels.

**3. Adaptive Delivery System:**

*   **Input:** Sensory package, user device capabilities, real-time context.
*   **Process:**
    *   Prioritize channels based on device availability (e.g., mobile phone with visual/auditory, smartwatch with haptic).
    *   Dynamically adjust content intensity (volume, vibration strength, scent concentration) based on user feedback (heart rate, eye tracking, vocal cues).
    *   Implement an ‘emotional resonance’ metric – measure user response to the sensory package and adjust content accordingly.
*   **Output:** Personalized and adaptive sensory experience.

**4. Campaign Control Interface**

*   **Input:** Campaign Goal, Product Selection, Budget.
*   **Process:** A GUI interface which allows for selection of the dynamic persona generation parameters, campaign length, target users.
*   **Output:** The campaign is initialized with these specifications.

**Pseudocode - Adaptive Delivery Loop:**

```
LOOP:
    RECEIVE user_data (heart_rate, eye_tracking, vocal_cues)
    CALCULATE emotional_resonance_score
    IF emotional_resonance_score < threshold:
        ADJUST content_intensity (volume, vibration, scent)
        SWITCH sensory_channel (prioritize based on user engagement)
    ENDIF
    DELIVER sensory_package (coordinated content across channels)
    WAIT (configurable interval)
ENDLOOP
```

**Novelty:** The combination of dynamic persona generation, multi-sensory content delivery, and real-time adaptation creates a uniquely immersive and personalized advertising experience.  Existing systems focus on simple A/B testing or basic dynamic creative optimization. This system goes beyond that, aiming to evoke an emotional response and create a lasting connection with the user.  It aims for an environment of holistic sensation.
