## Adaptive Bandwidth Allocation for Sensor Fusion Outlier Detection

**Concept:** Leverage the sensor data itself to dynamically adjust the number of bands and hash functions within each band used for Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). The goal is to optimize the LSH process based on the *diversity* and *density* of the incoming sensor data stream.  This differs from static band/hash function configuration.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:** Streaming sensor data (multi-variate time series).  Assume data is pre-processed (normalized/scaled).
*   **Diversity Metric:** Calculate a rolling variance/covariance across all input variables.  High variance/covariance indicates high data diversity.  A rolling window (e.g., 60 seconds) will be used.
*   **Density Metric:** Calculate a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) for each input variable using a rolling window.  KDE provides a measure of data density.
*   **Bandwidth Allocation Module:**
    *   Input: Diversity Metric, Density Metric
    *   Process:
        *   Define pre-set thresholds for Diversity and Density (tunable parameters). These thresholds determine the "complexity" of the data stream.
        *   Based on the thresholds, dynamically adjust:
            *   *Number of Bands:* Higher diversity/density = More bands.  This increases the granularity of the hashing.
            *   *Hash Functions per Band:* Higher diversity/density = More hash functions per band.  This increases the probability of collision for similar data points.
        *   Implement a smoothing filter (e.g., exponential moving average) to prevent rapid fluctuations in band/hash function configuration.
*   **LSH Implementation:** Standard LSH with the dynamically allocated bands and hash functions. Use MinHash signatures.
*   **Outlier Detection:** Standard outlier detection using the MinHash signatures and estimated counts (as in the original patent).
*   **Output:** Outlier status for each data record in the stream.
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Standard computing device capable of handling streaming data and performing statistical calculations. GPU acceleration for KDE calculation is optional but recommended.
*   **Software Requirements:** Programming language: Python. Libraries: NumPy, SciPy (for statistical calculations), scikit-learn (for KDE), a suitable LSH library.

**Pseudocode (Bandwidth Allocation Module):**

```python
def allocate_bandwidth(diversity, density, base_bands=4, base_hash_functions=8):
  """
  Dynamically allocates bandwidth (bands & hash functions) for LSH.

  Args:
    diversity: Rolling variance/covariance across input variables.
    density: Kernel Density Estimate.
    base_bands: Default number of bands.
    base_hash_functions: Default number of hash functions per band.

  Returns:
    num_bands:  Number of bands to use.
    hash_functions_per_band: Number of hash functions per band.
  """

  diversity_threshold = 0.5  # Tunable parameter
  density_threshold = 0.2  # Tunable parameter

  num_bands = base_bands
  hash_functions_per_band = base_hash_functions

  if diversity > diversity_threshold:
    num_bands = int(base_bands * (1 + (diversity - diversity_threshold)))  # Increase bands
  if density > density_threshold:
    hash_functions_per_band = int(base_hash_functions * (1 + (density - density_threshold))) # Increase hash functions

  # Apply smoothing filter (exponential moving average)
  # (Implementation omitted for brevity)

  return num_bands, hash_functions_per_band
```

**Innovation:**

The key innovation is the dynamic adjustment of LSH bandwidth based on real-time data characteristics.  This allows the system to adapt to changing data streams, improving outlier detection accuracy and efficiency.  Traditional LSH implementations typically use a fixed configuration, which may not be optimal for all data streams. This system provides a means of self-tuning the LSH process, making it more robust and scalable.  The use of both diversity and density metrics provides a more comprehensive assessment of the data stream complexity.
