## Dynamic Query Shaping via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Instead of just *attributing* cost to a query via an identifier, actively *shape* the query itself in real-time using a reinforcement learning agent to minimize observed cost. This moves beyond simply measuring cost to proactively optimizing query performance based on dynamic system conditions.

**Specs:**

1.  **RL Agent:** Implement a Reinforcement Learning agent (e.g., Q-learning, Deep Q-Network) integrated into the query processing pipeline.
2.  **State Space:** The agent's state should include:
    *   Current query plan (abstract syntax tree).
    *   Real-time system load metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
    *   Recent query execution statistics (latency, throughput, resource usage).
    *   Identifier associated with the invocation (customer, application, etc.).
3.  **Action Space:** The agent’s actions will be transformations applied to the query plan. Examples:
    *   Index selection (choose different index for a table scan).
    *   Join order modification.
    *   Adding or removing query hints.
    *   Partition pruning.
    *   Materialization of intermediate results.
4.  **Reward Function:** The reward function is critical. It should combine:
    *   Negative query execution time (minimize latency).
    *   Negative resource consumption (minimize CPU, memory, I/O).
    *   A penalty for overly complex query plans.
    *   A bonus for consistently low latency/resource usage.
5.  **Training:** The agent should be trained using:
    *   Historical query logs.
    *   A simulated database environment.
    *   Online learning (continuously adapting to real-time conditions).
6.  **Query Interception & Modification:**
    *   Intercept queries before execution.
    *   Pass the query plan to the RL agent.
    *   The agent returns a modified query plan.
    *   Execute the modified query.
7.  **A/B Testing:** Implement A/B testing to compare the performance of the RL-optimized queries against the baseline (original queries).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Query Reception
query = receive_query()
identifier = get_identifier(query)

// Query Plan Extraction
plan = extract_query_plan(query)

// RL Agent Decision
modified_plan = rl_agent.choose_action(plan, system_metrics, identifier)

// Apply Modification
modified_query = apply_plan(modified_plan)

// Execute Query
result = execute_query(modified_query)

// Log Performance
log_performance(modified_query, result, system_metrics)

// Update RL Agent (Online Learning)
rl_agent.update(reward)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Query Plan Tree:** A hierarchical representation of the query, enabling manipulation of individual operations.
*   **System Metrics:** Real-time data on CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage.
*   **Reward History:** Store historical rewards to track agent learning and prevent overfitting.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-Agent System:** Deploy multiple RL agents, each specialized in optimizing a specific type of query (e.g., analytical queries, transactional queries).
*   **Federated Learning:** Train the RL agent using data from multiple databases without sharing sensitive query information.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** Provide insights into the agent’s decision-making process, enabling database administrators to understand *why* certain query transformations were applied.
