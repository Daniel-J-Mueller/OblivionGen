## Dynamic Data Sheet 'Lenses'

**Concept:** Extend the cell relationship functionality by introducing configurable ‘Lenses’ – virtual data sheets presenting a filtered or transformed view of data from multiple source sheets, all driven by the cell relationships already established. These Lenses aren’t copies of the data; they're dynamically updating views.

**Specifications:**

**1. Lens Creation Interface:**

*   **Trigger:**  Right-click on any cell within a data sheet to initiate "Create Lens".
*   **Lens Definition:** A modal window opens presenting:
    *   **Name:** User-defined name for the Lens.
    *   **Source Cell Selection:**  A visual graph editor allowing the user to drag and connect cells from *any* accessible data sheet (based on established relationships).  Connected cells become data sources for the Lens.
    *   **Transformation Rules:** A rule-based engine where the user can define:
        *   **Filters:**  Specify conditions to include/exclude data from source cells (e.g., "Show only rows where 'Status' = 'Active'").
        *   **Calculations:** Apply formulas to source cell data (e.g., "Sum of 'Sales' * 'Tax Rate'").
        *   **Data Type Conversions:** Transform data types (e.g., "Convert 'Date' to 'Quarter'").
        *   **Aggregation:**  Summarize data (e.g., "Average of 'Price'").
    *   **Layout Definition:** A simple grid layout editor to define how the transformed data should be presented within the Lens. Columns are derived from selected source cells and applied transformations.
*   **Save/Cancel:** Buttons to save the Lens definition or cancel the operation.

**2. Lens Display & Interaction:**

*   **Lens Access:** Lenses are accessible as separate tabs or windows within the application, listed alongside regular data sheets.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** Any change to a source cell (through direct edit or formula calculation) automatically propagates to the Lens, reflecting the updated view. Update speed is prioritized (optimizations for large datasets required).
*   **Lens Editing:** Users can reopen and modify Lens definitions at any time. Changes are reflected immediately.
*   **'Source Cell' Highlighting:**  Within a Lens, clicking on a data point highlights the corresponding source cell(s) in the original data sheet(s), visually indicating the data lineage.

**3. Pseudocode – Update Propagation**

```
function UpdateLens(lens, changedCell) {
  // 1. Check if the changedCell is a source cell for this lens
  if (lens.sourceCells.includes(changedCell)) {
    // 2. Recalculate the lens data based on the updated cell
    lensData = ApplyTransformationRules(lens.transformationRules, lens.sourceCells)

    // 3. Update the Lens display
    UpdateLensDisplay(lensData)
  }
}

function ApplyTransformationRules(rules, sourceCells) {
    //For each rule
        //Apply filter
        //Perform calculation
        //Convert data type
        //Aggregate data
    //Return transformed data
}
```

**4. Security Considerations**

*   Lens access should respect security settings of the source data sheets.  Users must have permission to view the source data to access it through a Lens.
*   The system should prevent the creation of Lenses that expose sensitive data without proper authorization.

**5. Potential Extensions**

*   **Shared Lenses:** Allow users to share Lenses with other collaborators.
*   **Lens Templates:** Create pre-defined Lenses for common use cases.
*   **AI-Powered Lens Creation:** Automatically suggest Lenses based on data analysis and user patterns.
*   **Version Control for Lenses**: Track changes to Lens definitions over time.
