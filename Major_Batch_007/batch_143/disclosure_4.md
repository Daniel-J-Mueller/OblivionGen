## Automated Policy Inheritance & Conflict Resolution for Multi-Cloud Environments

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the tag-based policy application to facilitate automated policy *inheritance* and *conflict resolution* across disparate cloud provider environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).  This moves beyond simple tag propagation to active policy harmonization.

**II. Components:**

*   **Universal Policy Language (UPL):**  A standardized, cloud-agnostic policy definition language.  Policies are authored in UPL, then translated into native policy formats for each cloud provider.
*   **Policy Translation Engine:**  Responsible for translating UPL policies into cloud-specific policy formats (e.g., AWS IAM policies, Azure Policy definitions, GCP Organization Policies).  This component includes a mapping database to handle differences in semantics and capabilities between providers.
*   **Policy Inheritance Manager:**  Tracks policy inheritance relationships between resources.  This is more sophisticated than simple tag propagation. It supports:
    *   **Explicit Inheritance:**  Tags explicitly define a parent resource or policy source.
    *   **Implicit Inheritance:**  Rules define inheritance based on resource type, location, or other attributes.  (e.g., "All resources in the 'Development' environment inherit security policies from the 'BaseSecurityPolicy'").
*   **Conflict Resolution Engine:**  Identifies and resolves conflicts when multiple policies apply to the same resource.  Conflict resolution strategies include:
    *   **Precedence:** Policies are prioritized based on a configurable order.
    *   **Merging:**  Compatible policy rules are merged into a single, unified policy.
    *   **Exception Handling:** Specific rules are defined to override conflicting policies in certain situations.
*   **Central Policy Repository:**  Stores all UPL policies, inheritance rules, and conflict resolution configurations. This is accessible via API for automation and monitoring.
*   **Cross-Cloud Agent:** A lightweight agent deployed within each cloud environment.  This agent:
    *   Receives policy updates from the Central Policy Repository.
    *   Applies policies to resources based on tags and inheritance rules.
    *   Reports policy compliance status back to the Central Policy Repository.

**III.  Data Structures:**

*   **Policy Definition (UPL):** JSON-based structure defining policy rules, action criteria, and resource targets.
    ```json
    {
      "name": "DataRetentionPolicy",
      "description": "Policy for retaining data for 30 days",
      "resource_type": "storage_bucket",
      "action": "delete_data",
      "criteria": {
        "age": "30 days"
      },
      "tags": ["data_retention", "compliance"]
    }
    ```
*   **Inheritance Rule:** Defines how policies are inherited by resources.
    ```json
    {
      "parent_resource_tag": "BaseSecurityPolicy",
      "child_resource_tag": "DevelopmentServer",
      "inheritance_type": "explicit" // or "implicit"
    }
    ```
*   **Conflict Resolution Rule:**  Specifies how to resolve conflicts between policies.
    ```json
    {
      "policy_names": ["PolicyA", "PolicyB"],
      "resolution_strategy": "precedence",
      "priority": 1 // Lower number = higher priority
    }
    ```

**IV.  Pseudocode â€“ Policy Application Process:**

```
function applyPolicy(resource, policy):
  // 1. Check if the resource has the policy tag.
  if (resource.tags.contains(policy.tag)):
    // 2. Verify policy validity.
    if (isValidPolicy(policy)):
      // 3. Determine actions to perform.
      actions = getActions(policy)
      // 4. Apply actions to the resource.
      performActions(resource, actions)
    else:
      logError("Invalid policy: " + policy.name)
  else:
    // 5. Check for inherited policies.
    inheritedPolicies = getInheritedPolicies(resource)
    if (inheritedPolicies != null):
      for inheritedPolicy in inheritedPolicies:
        applyPolicy(resource, inheritedPolicy)
```

**V.  API Endpoints:**

*   `/policies`:  Create, read, update, and delete UPL policies.
*   `/inheritance`: Manage inheritance rules.
*   `/conflicts`:  Manage conflict resolution rules.
*   `/compliance`:  Retrieve policy compliance status for resources.
*   `/translate`: Translate a UPL policy to a specific cloud provider's format.
