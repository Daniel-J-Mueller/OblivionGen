**Personalized Lexical Evolution Modeling**

**Core Concept:** Extend the ability to determine term meaning *over time* (as hinted at in claim 7) by creating a dynamic, *personalized* model of a user's lexical understanding. This isn’t simply tracking changes in *general* language usage, but modeling how an individual's understanding of words shifts based on *their* reading habits, queries, and interactions with the system.

**System Specs:**

*   **User Profile Data:** Persistent storage for user-specific lexical data. This includes:
    *   **Initial Lexical Baseline:** A pre-existing understanding of word meanings (e.g., derived from a standard dictionary, large language model, or initial user assessment).
    *   **Reading History:** Logs of all content (books, articles, etc.) accessed by the user.
    *   **Query History:** Records of all terms the user has queried within the system.
    *   **Interaction Data:** Records of user responses to vocabulary questions, corrections to system-provided definitions, or explicit feedback on meaning disambiguation.
    *   **Temporal Lexical Vectors:** Time-series data representing the user’s understanding of a given term at different points in time.

*   **Lexical Evolution Engine:** The core algorithm responsible for updating the temporal lexical vectors.
    *   **Input:** User profile data, current content being read, user queries.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  **Contextual Analysis:** Extract the context surrounding a target term in the current content.
        2.  **Meaning Probability Estimation:** Based on the context, the user’s reading history, and the initial lexical baseline, estimate the probability of different meanings for the term. (Bayesian approach recommended).
        3.  **Vector Update:** Adjust the user’s temporal lexical vector for the term based on the estimated probabilities. New meanings or nuances can be added, and existing ones can be reinforced or diminished.
        4.  **Feedback Loop:** Integrate user feedback (corrections, quiz responses) to refine the vector update process.

*   **Adaptive Vocabulary Question Generation:**
    *   The system generates vocabulary questions *tailored* to the user’s evolving lexical understanding.
    *   Questions are designed to test the user's grasp of nuanced meanings or subtle shifts in usage, as identified by the Lexical Evolution Engine.
    *   Difficulty is dynamically adjusted based on user performance.

*   **“Lexical Fingerprint” Visualization:** A user-facing interface allowing users to visualize their personal lexical evolution over time. This could show:
    *   The most significant changes in their understanding of specific terms.
    *   The areas of language where their knowledge is expanding or contracting.
    *   A comparison of their lexical fingerprint to that of other users.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Lexical Vector Update):**

```
function updateLexicalVector(userProfile, term, context, newMeaningProbability):
  // Get current lexical vector for the term
  vector = userProfile.getLexicalVector(term)

  // Update the vector based on the new meaning probability
  vector.update(newMeaningProbability)

  // Apply smoothing to prevent drastic changes
  vector.smooth()

  // Store the updated vector
  userProfile.storeLexicalVector(vector)
```

**Innovation Focus:** This goes beyond simply identifying *a* meaning of a word. It creates a *model* of how a person’s understanding of that word changes over time, creating a truly personalized learning experience. It leverages the existing ability to disambiguate meanings, then adds a temporal dimension *and* a user-specific dimension.
