## Dynamic Network Persona Shifting

**Concept:** Extend the virtual network remapping concept to allow customer devices to dynamically *shift* network personas – complete sets of network attributes – based on real-time conditions and policies. This goes beyond simple IP address remapping; it involves altering firewall rules, quality of service (QoS) settings, security profiles, and even the apparent geographic location of the customer device.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Definition:** A "Persona" is a container holding:
    *   IP Address(es)
    *   Firewall Ruleset (allowing/blocking specific traffic)
    *   QoS Profile (bandwidth allocation, prioritization)
    *   Security Profile (intrusion detection/prevention settings)
    *   Geo-Location Spoofing Data (optional – virtual location)
    *   DNS Settings (custom DNS servers)
*   **Policy Engine:** A rule-based engine allows customers to define policies for persona selection. Policies are triggered by:
    *   Time of day
    *   Device location (GPS, network triangulation)
    *   Application being used (e.g., high-bandwidth video streaming)
    *   Network conditions (latency, packet loss)
    *   Security events (detected threats)
*   **Persona Library:** A central repository stores pre-defined and custom personas.  Customers can create and manage personas through a UI or API.  A 'default' persona is always present.
*   **Dynamic Remapping Service:**  This service monitors triggering conditions, selects the appropriate persona based on the policy engine, and dynamically remaps the customer device to that persona. This involves updating all relevant network configurations (firewall, routing, QoS).
*   **Persona Cloning/Templating:** Ability to clone existing personas to rapidly create variations, reducing configuration overhead.
*   **Integration with Threat Intelligence:** Threat intelligence feeds can automatically trigger persona shifts. For example, if a device is detected communicating with a known malicious IP address, it can be shifted to a highly restricted “quarantine” persona.
*   **API Access:** Full API access for programmatic persona management and integration with other systems (e.g., SIEM, orchestration platforms).

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Remapping Service):**

```
function handleDeviceEvent(deviceId, eventType, eventData):
  device = getDevice(deviceId)
  policies = getPolicies(device)

  for policy in policies:
    if policy.condition(eventType, eventData):
      persona = policy.persona
      if persona != device.currentPersona:
        applyPersona(device, persona)
        log("Device %s shifted to persona %s", deviceId, persona.name)
        break // Apply only the first matching policy
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   Use a distributed architecture for scalability and resilience.
*   Leverage virtualization and containerization technologies for persona isolation.
*   Employ a stateful service to track device personas and policy mappings.
*   Design the system to be extensible and support custom policies and personas.
*   Implement robust logging and monitoring for troubleshooting and performance analysis.
