## Dynamic Access Window Fusion & Prediction

**Concept:** Expand the access window system to proactively *fuse* and *predict* access patterns, creating dynamically sized, composite windows that anticipate future requests *before* they occur. This moves beyond reactive shifting of items between pre-defined windows to a predictive system building temporary, composite access units.

**Specifications:**

**1. Prediction Engine:**

   *   **Input:** Real-time access request logs (user ID, item ID, timestamp). Historical access logs (long-term trends). Item metadata (category, price, related items). User profile data (demographics, purchase history).
   *   **Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained to predict the next *N* items a user is likely to access, given their recent activity.  The network outputs a probability distribution over all items in the data store.
   *   **Output:** A ranked list of predicted item IDs, along with confidence scores for each prediction.

**2. Composite Access Window Creation:**

   *   **Trigger:**  The Prediction Engine identifies a high-confidence prediction cluster (e.g., 5 items with confidence > 80%).
   *   **Window Construction:** A *temporary* Composite Access Window (CAW) is created. This CAW isn't tied to a fixed bucket or size. Its contents are determined by:
        *   Items currently in existing access windows that match the prediction.
        *   Predicted items *not* currently in any access window. These are proactively loaded into the CAW.
   *   **CAW Metadata:**  Each CAW has associated metadata:
        *   Creation timestamp.
        *   Expiration timestamp (based on prediction confidence decay and inactivity).
        *   User ID.
        *   Prediction confidence score.
        *   List of contributing prediction models (for explainability).

**3. Request Handling:**

   *   **CAW Check:**  On each access request, *before* checking standard access windows, the system checks if a CAW exists for the user and if the requested item is within that CAW.
   *   **Fast Path:** If the item is in a CAW, it’s served directly from the CAW's memory space, bypassing standard bucket lookups.
   *   **Standard Path:** If not in a CAW, standard access window lookup proceeds as before.

**4. Dynamic CAW Management:**

   *   **CAW Decay:** CAWs have an expiration timer. As time passes or prediction confidence decreases, the CAW's priority is lowered.
   *   **CAW Fusion:** If multiple CAWs overlap for a user, they are merged into a single, larger CAW.
   *   **CAW Splitting:**  If a CAW becomes too large or its prediction accuracy drops significantly, it’s split into multiple smaller CAWs based on item similarity or access patterns.
   *   **CAW Purging:** Expired or low-priority CAWs are purged from memory.

**Pseudocode (Request Handling):**

```
function handleAccessRequest(userID, itemID):
  // Check for CAW
  caw = findActiveCAW(userID, itemID)
  if caw != null:
    // Serve from CAW
    item = loadFromCAW(caw, itemID)
    return item

  // Standard access window lookup
  bucket = findBucket(userID)
  accessWindow = findAccessWindow(bucket, itemID)
  if accessWindow != null:
    item = loadFromAccessWindow(accessWindow, itemID)
    return item

  // Item not found
  return null
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **CAW:**  {userID, creationTimestamp, expirationTimestamp, confidenceScore, items[]}
*   **Access Window:** {bucketID, items[]}

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   **Distributed CAW Cache:** CAWs should be stored in a distributed cache (e.g., Redis) to handle a large number of users.
*   **Asynchronous CAW Updates:** CAW creation, fusion, and purging should be done asynchronously to minimize impact on request latency.
*   **Prediction Model Updates:** The RNN model should be retrained periodically using new access logs to maintain accuracy.
