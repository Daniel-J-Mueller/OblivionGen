## Adaptive Data Container Sharding with Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Dynamically shard data containers (volumes, file systems) *before* performance bottlenecks occur, and proactively balance load across storage servers based on predictive analysis of file access patterns.  This moves beyond simply reporting size and into preemptive performance optimization.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Access Pattern Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:**  Real-time file system access logs (read/write frequency, file size, user/application ID, time of day/week). Historical access logs. Metadata about file types (video, text, database, etc.).
*   **Process:** Employ time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict future access patterns *at the file level*.  Identify 'hot' files/directories that are likely to experience increased load.  Correlate access patterns with metadata to refine predictions (e.g., predict higher load on video files during peak streaming hours).  Calculate a 'load score' for each data container and its constituent files.
*   **Output:**  Load score per data container. Predicted access patterns (files/directories with increasing load).

**2. Adaptive Sharding Engine:**

*   **Input:** Load scores from the Predictive Access Pattern Analysis Module.  Data container metadata (current size, number of files, replication factor).  Storage server capacity and utilization.  User-defined performance thresholds.
*   **Process:** Based on load scores exceeding predefined thresholds, initiate a data container sharding process.  Use a consistent hashing algorithm to determine the optimal distribution of files/directories across storage servers.  Prioritize sharding 'hot' files/directories to reduce load on overloaded servers.  Implement a rolling shard update to minimize downtime and data inconsistency.  Monitor shard performance and dynamically adjust shard boundaries based on real-time load.
*   **Output:**  Shard creation/modification commands. Data migration tasks. Performance monitoring data.

**3. Dynamic Load Balancing Controller:**

*   **Input:** Real-time storage server utilization. Predicted access patterns. Shard locations. User-defined load balancing policies (e.g., prioritize low latency, maximize throughput).
*   **Process:**  Monitor storage server load.  Based on predicted access patterns and current load, dynamically adjust data placement.  Utilize data replication and caching to distribute load and improve performance. Implement a weighted round-robin or least-connections load balancing algorithm.  Proactively migrate data from overloaded servers to underutilized servers.
*   **Output:** Data migration tasks.  Caching directives. Load balancing configuration updates.

**4. API Extensions:**

*   `GET /containers/{container_id}/predictions`: Retrieve predicted access patterns and load scores for a data container.
*   `POST /containers/{container_id}/shard`:  Initiate a data container sharding process.
*   `GET /servers/{server_id}/load`: Retrieve real-time load information for a storage server.
*   `POST /data/{data_id}/migrate`:  Initiate a data migration task.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Sharding Engine):**

```
function shardContainer(containerId, threshold, serverList):
  loadScore = getLoadScore(containerId)
  if loadScore > threshold:
    files = getFiles(containerId)
    hotFiles = identifyHotFiles(files)
    for file in hotFiles:
      targetServer = consistentHash(file, serverList)
      migrateData(file, targetServer)
    updateContainerMetadata(containerId)
  else:
    log("Container load below threshold. No sharding required.")
```

**Novelty:**

This differs from the provided patent by *proactively* addressing performance bottlenecks *before* they occur, using predictive analysis and dynamic sharding. The patent focuses on *reporting* information; this focuses on *acting* on that information to optimize performance.  It moves beyond size information to predictive load modeling and automated optimization.
