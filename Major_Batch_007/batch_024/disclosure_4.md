## Dynamic Inventory 'Heatmaps' via Projected Light Fields

**Concept:** Augment the existing image-based inventory system with real-time projected light fields to create dynamic 'heatmaps' overlaid onto the physical inventory. This provides immediate visual cues regarding stock levels, item location, and potential issues (e.g., misplaced items, low stock).

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of low-power pico-projectors integrated into existing facility lighting infrastructure. (Potential use of existing camera housings)
    *   Each projector must be individually addressable and capable of emitting structured light patterns.
    *   High-resolution, wide-angle cameras (existing or upgraded) to capture projected light fields and inventory data.
    *   Edge computing devices (integrated with existing systems) for real-time data processing and light field generation.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Inventory Management System (IMS) Integration:** Access to real-time inventory data (quantity, location, status).
    *   **Light Field Generation Module:** Translates inventory data into structured light patterns.  Patterns represent stock levels (intensity = quantity), item location (projection point), and flags (e.g., red = low stock, blinking = misplaced).
    *   **Calibration & Mapping Module:**  Creates a 3D map of the facility, calibrates projectors to accurately project onto the inventory, and compensates for environmental factors (e.g., ambient light, obstructions). This uses existing camera data for initial mapping and continuous refinement.
    *   **Occlusion Handling:**  Software algorithms to predict and compensate for potential occlusion of projected light by inventory items, personnel, or equipment. Prioritizes projection onto unobstructed areas and uses predictive modeling to estimate stock levels in occluded regions.
    *   **User Interface:** Web-based dashboard for system configuration, calibration, and monitoring.  Displays real-time inventory heatmaps and provides alerts for critical events.

**Pseudocode (Light Field Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateLightField(inventoryData, facilityMap):

    FOR EACH item IN inventoryData:

        location = item.location
        quantity = item.quantity

        // Determine Projection Point
        projectionPoint = facilityMap.GetProjectionPoint(location)

        // Calculate Intensity based on Quantity
        intensity = MapQuantityToIntensity(quantity)

        // Create Light Pattern (e.g., color, shape, intensity)
        pattern = CreateInventoryPattern(intensity, item.status)

        // Send Projection Command to Projector
        SendProjectionCommand(projectorID, projectionPoint, pattern)

    END FOR

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION MapQuantityToIntensity(quantity):
    // Linear or logarithmic mapping from quantity to intensity value
    intensity = quantity * scaleFactor
    RETURN intensity
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** The system differs from existing inventory tracking by *overlaying* dynamic visual information directly onto the physical inventory, creating an intuitive and real-time 'heat map' for personnel. It proactively communicates inventory status through light, rather than requiring personnel to query a system.  The system addresses visibility challenges in large warehouses by using projection to 'highlight' specific areas or items. This is especially relevant for visually complex or densely packed inventory.
