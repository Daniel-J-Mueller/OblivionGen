**Secure Hardware Attestation & Dynamic Root of Trust Provisioning – ‘Chameleon TPM’**

**Concept:** Extend TPM functionality to dynamically alter its attestation key hierarchy based on environmental trust levels, effectively creating a ‘Chameleon TPM’ that presents different identities/trust anchors depending on where it’s operating. This is inspired by the patent's focus on secure configuration and authentication, but moves beyond static credentials.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** TPM module with onboard cryptographic accelerator, secure storage, and a dedicated hardware random number generator (HRNG).  Must support multiple key hierarchies (at least 3).
*   **Software – Root of Trust Manager (RTM):**  A small, highly-verified hypervisor-level component that runs on the host system. This is the core of the Chameleon TPM.
*   **Software – Environmental Trust Sensor (ETS):** A software component running within the RTM.  Responsible for assessing the current operating environment. Metrics include:
    *   Network connectivity (trusted/untrusted network detection).
    *   Boot status (secure boot verified/unverified).
    *   Hypervisor presence (VM/bare metal).
    *   Physical enclosure integrity (tamper detection).
    *   Geolocation (optional).
*   **Key Hierarchies:**
    *   *Hierarchy 0 – Secure Enclave:* Highest security. Used in fully trusted environments (e.g., secure data center, verified secure boot). Provides strong attestation for sensitive workloads.
    *   *Hierarchy 1 – Isolated VM:*  Used in virtualized environments. Provides attestation specific to the VM, isolating it from the hypervisor.
    *   *Hierarchy 2 – Public Cloud:* Lowest security, designed for public cloud environments. Attestation provides a basic level of trust for cloud workloads.
*   **Dynamic Key Rotation:** RTM, based on ETS input, rotates the active key hierarchy. This happens during boot or when environmental conditions change.
*   **Attestation Protocol Enhancement:** Modified attestation protocol to include a ‘Trust Level Indicator’ (TLI) alongside the standard attestation data. This TLI indicates the current key hierarchy being used.
*   **Remote Provisioning:** Secure remote provisioning mechanism to update the RTM and ETS components.

**Pseudocode – RTM Component (Simplified):**

```
// Boot Sequence
Initialize_Hardware()
Load_RTM_Configuration()

// Main Loop
While (System_Running)
{
  Environmental_Trust_Level = ETS.Assess_Environment()

  If (Environmental_Trust_Level == HIGH)
  {
    Active_Key_Hierarchy = 0 // Secure Enclave
  }
  Else If (Environmental_Trust_Level == MEDIUM)
  {
    Active_Key_Hierarchy = 1 // Isolated VM
  }
  Else
  {
    Active_Key_Hierarchy = 2 // Public Cloud
  }

  // Respond to Attestation Requests using Active_Key_Hierarchy
  Process_Attestation_Request()
}
```

**Innovation Points:**

*   **Adaptive Trust:**  Moves beyond static trust anchors to a dynamic system.
*   **Increased Security Posture:**  Limits the impact of compromised environments. Even if one hierarchy is compromised, others remain secure.
*   **Enhanced Flexibility:** Allows devices to operate seamlessly across diverse environments.
*   **Future-Proofing:** Facilitates the adoption of new security technologies and protocols.
