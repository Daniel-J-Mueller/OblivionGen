## Modular Aerial Power Network – "Skyweave"

**Concept:** A system for creating a dynamically reconfigurable, localized aerial power grid utilizing swarms of UAVs – building upon the power-harvesting principle but expanding it to *distribute* power as well, not just consume/transfer.

**Specs:**

*   **UAV Type:** "Skyweave Node" –  approx. 50cm diameter hexacopter. Payload capacity: 2kg.
*   **Power Harvesting:** Induction coil array (similar to the patent) optimized for diverse AC frequency ranges and magnetic field orientations. Output: DC 48V.
*   **Power Distribution:**
    *   Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) Modules: Multiple high-efficiency WPT transmitters (focused beam). Range: 5-10 meters.  Frequency: 900 MHz - 5.8 GHz (dynamic selection). Output: Adjustable 5V, 12V, 24V, 48V.
    *   Physical Connector Ports:  Standardized high-current connector (e.g., Anderson Powerpole) for direct wired connections to other Skyweave Nodes or ground-based assets.
*   **Communication:**
    *   Mesh Networking: Dedicated 5 GHz communication link for inter-node communication (forming a dynamic mesh network).
    *   Ground Station Link: Long-range communication (LoRaWAN or similar) to ground control for monitoring, task assignment, and data logging.
*   **Swarm Intelligence:**
    *   Distributed Algorithm: Each Skyweave Node executes a distributed algorithm for self-organization, power routing, and fault tolerance. 
    *   Role Assignment: Nodes dynamically assign roles (e.g., "Power Source," "Relay," "Consumer") based on available power, proximity to other nodes, and task demands.
*   **Energy Storage:**  Solid-state batteries (48V, 10Ah) for temporary power buffering and emergency operation.
*   **Payload Integration:** Modular payload bay capable of accepting various sensors, communication devices, or small delivery packages (max 1kg).

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Node Initialization
function initializeNode() {
  connectToMeshNetwork();
  scanForPowerSources();
  scanForConsumers();
  determineNodeRole();
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  monitorPowerAvailability();
  monitorConsumerDemand();
  updateNodeRole();

  if (role == "Power Source") {
    broadcastPowerAvailability();
  } else if (role == "Relay") {
    routePowerToConsumer();
  } else if (role == "Consumer") {
    requestPower();
  }

  monitorNodeHealth();
  reportStatusToGroundStation();
  sleep(0.1 seconds);
}

// Power Routing Algorithm (Simplified)
function routePowerToConsumer() {
  // Find the shortest path to the consumer with available power
  shortestPath = findShortestPath(consumer, availablePowerNodes);

  // Establish a WPT link or physical connection
  establishLink(shortestPath);

  // Monitor link quality and adjust power transmission
  monitorLink(shortestPath);
}
```

**Applications:**

*   Temporary power for disaster relief or remote events.
*   Localized power grids for construction sites or agricultural operations.
*   Charging stations for other UAVs or electric vehicles.
*   Real-time monitoring of power grid infrastructure (using onboard sensors).
*   Mobile communication relay network.
