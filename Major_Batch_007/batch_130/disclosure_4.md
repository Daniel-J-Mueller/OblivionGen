## Adaptive Question Decomposition & Contextual Expansion

**Concept:** The patent focuses on handling questions the system *can't* answer. This design builds on that by proactively *breaking down* complex questions into smaller, more manageable sub-questions *before* attempting to answer, and then dynamically expanding the context around those sub-questions with related knowledge. It goes beyond simple decomposition to actively seek out relevant contextual information.

**Specs:**

1.  **Question Analyzer Module:**
    *   Input: User Question (text).
    *   Process:
        *   Syntax & Semantic Parsing: Identifies core entities, relationships, and intent.
        *   Complexity Assessment:  Assigns a “Complexity Score” based on sentence length, number of entities, ambiguity, and required reasoning steps.  Score ranges 1-10 (1=simple, 10=highly complex).
        *   Decomposition Trigger: If Complexity Score > 5, initiate Question Decomposition.
2.  **Question Decomposition Engine:**
    *   Input:  Original Question, Complexity Score.
    *   Process:
        *   Recursive Splitting:  Breaks down the question into smaller sub-questions based on identified clauses and relationships. Prioritizes splitting at conjunctions ("and," "or") and prepositional phrases.
        *   Sub-Question Generation: Creates a set of logically connected sub-questions.  Example: "What were the major causes of the French Revolution and how did they impact European society?"  -> Sub-questions: "What were the major causes of the French Revolution?", "How did the French Revolution impact European society?".
        *   Dependency Graph Creation:  Builds a graph representing the dependencies between sub-questions. This allows for parallel processing and reordering of sub-questions.
3.  **Contextual Expansion Module:**
    *   Input: Sub-Question, Knowledge Base.
    *   Process:
        *   Keyword Extraction: Identifies key terms in the sub-question.
        *   Semantic Search:  Performs a semantic search in the Knowledge Base (and external sources if enabled) using the extracted keywords. Prioritizes results based on semantic similarity, source authority, and recency.
        *   Contextual Snippet Generation:  Extracts relevant snippets of text from the search results.  These snippets provide context *around* the keywords, not just direct answers.
        *   Contextual Vector Embedding: Creates a vector embedding of the contextual snippets. This allows for similarity comparison with other contextual snippets and answers.
4.  **Answer Synthesis Engine:**
    *   Input: Answers to Sub-Questions, Contextual Vectors, Dependency Graph.
    *   Process:
        *   Contextual Enrichment:  Combines the answers to sub-questions with the relevant contextual snippets.
        *   Dependency Resolution:  Uses the dependency graph to order and connect the enriched answers.
        *   Natural Language Generation:  Generates a coherent and comprehensive answer to the original question.
5.  **Confidence Scoring:**
    *   Assigns a confidence score to the final answer based on the quality of the sub-answers, the relevance of the contextual snippets, and the coherence of the generated response.

**Pseudocode (Answer Synthesis Engine):**

```
function synthesizeAnswer(subQuestionAnswers, contextualVectors, dependencyGraph):
  enrichedAnswers = []
  for each subAnswer in subQuestionAnswers:
    relevantContext = findMostSimilarContext(subAnswer.keywords, contextualVectors)
    enrichedAnswer = combine(subAnswer.text, relevantContext)
    enrichedAnswers.append(enrichedAnswer)

  orderedAnswers = topologicalSort(enrichedAnswers, dependencyGraph) // Order based on dependencies

  finalAnswer = generateCoherentText(orderedAnswers)

  confidenceScore = calculateConfidence(finalAnswer, enrichedAnswers)

  return finalAnswer, confidenceScore
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply decomposing a question into solvable parts. The contextual expansion proactively gathers related knowledge *before* answering, increasing the richness and accuracy of the final response.  The dependency graph allows for a more nuanced understanding of the question and a more coherent answer synthesis. The confidence scoring provides a measure of answer reliability.
