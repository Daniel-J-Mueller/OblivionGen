**Decentralized Identity Propagation with Ephemeral Credentials**

**Concept:** Extend the account mapping concept beyond a centralized resource provider environment by leveraging a blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) to manage identity propagation and access control. Instead of relying on a central "identity pool", utilize a network of nodes to verify and authorize access based on short-lived, cryptographically signed credentials.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Credential Generation:**
    *   Upon successful user authentication (via the existing user pool), the authentication service doesn't just map to an identity pool. It generates a short-lived, digitally signed credential. This credential includes:
        *   User Identifier (UID) – from the user pool
        *   Resource Identifier (RID) – specifies the resource being accessed.
        *   Timestamp (valid from/to) – defines the credential’s lifespan (e.g., 5 minutes).
        *   Signature – generated using the resource provider’s private key.
    *   This credential is *not* stored in a centralized identity pool.

2.  **Distributed Credential Ledger (DCL):**
    *   A permissioned blockchain (or DLT) is established. Nodes on this network are operated by the resource provider and potentially trusted partners.
    *   The DCL’s sole purpose is to validate these ephemeral credentials.  It does *not* store user data.
    *   Nodes maintain a record of revoked credentials (based on expiry or explicit revocation).

3.  **Resource Access Flow:**
    *   When a user attempts to access a resource, the client presents the ephemeral credential.
    *   The resource server queries the DCL network.
    *   DCL nodes verify the credential's signature, check if it’s expired, and confirm it hasn’t been revoked.
    *   If valid, access is granted.

4.  **Smart Contract Integration:**
    *   Deploy smart contracts to the DCL to automate credential validation and revocation.
    *   Smart contracts can enforce fine-grained access control policies.

5.  **Credential Revocation:**
    *   Revocation can occur due to credential expiry, user account compromise, or policy changes.
    *   Revocation is recorded on the DCL, preventing further use of the compromised/expired credential.

**Pseudocode (Resource Access):**

```
function accessResource(userCredential):
  //Query DCL Network
  dclResponse = queryDCL(userCredential)

  if (dclResponse.valid == true):
    //Access Granted
    allowAccess()
  else:
    //Access Denied
    denyAccess()
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Ephemeral credentials reduce the window of opportunity for credential theft and misuse.
*   **Decentralization:** Eliminates reliance on a single point of failure (centralized identity pool).
*   **Scalability:** DLT can handle a large volume of credential validation requests.
*   **Privacy:** Minimizes the amount of user data stored on the DLT.
*   **Interoperability:**  Can enable seamless access across different resource providers.
