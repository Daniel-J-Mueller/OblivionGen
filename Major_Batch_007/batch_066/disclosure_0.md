## Dynamic Code Mutation for Robustness Testing

**Concept:** Extend the bug fixing approach to proactively *introduce* controlled mutations into code, then evaluate if the transformer model can *correct* them. This shifts the focus from fixing existing bugs to assessing the model's ability to handle novel (but syntactically valid) variations. This improves robustness and identifies edge cases the model hasn’t encountered.

**Specs:**

1.  **Mutation Engine:**
    *   Input: Source code (same format as bug fixing input).
    *   Mutation Types:  A configurable set of code transformations:
        *   Variable Renaming (local & global, with scope awareness)
        *   Constant Value Alteration (within a defined range, type-safe)
        *   Operator Substitution (e.g., `+` to `-`, `*` to `/`, boolean operators)
        *   Code Block Reordering (within functions, preserving dependency order)
        *   Conditional Inversion (e.g., `if (x > 5)` to `if (x <= 5)`)
        *   Dead Code Insertion (harmless but unnecessary code)
    *   Mutation Rate:  A parameter controlling the probability of applying a mutation to any given code element.
    *   Output: Mutated code variant.

2.  **Evaluation Pipeline:**
    *   Input: Original code & Mutated code variant.
    *   Process:
        1.  Feed the mutated code to the transformer-based bug fixing model.
        2.  Capture the model’s output (predicted edits).
        3.  Apply the edits to the mutated code.
        4.  Execute both the original code and the ‘fixed’ mutated code with a suite of test cases.
        5.  Compare the outputs of both executions.
        6.  Calculate a ‘Robustness Score’ based on the percentage of test cases that produce identical results.
    *   Output: Robustness Score, Edited Mutated Code, Diagnostic Report (indicating specific mutations the model struggled with).

3.  **Model Training Enhancement:**
    *   Generate a large dataset of original code + mutated code pairs.
    *   Train the transformer model to predict the *optimal edit* required to restore the mutated code to its original functionality. This is different from simply fixing bugs – the model must learn to *undo* specific types of mutations.
    *   Augment the training data with ‘negative examples’ – mutated code variants that are intentionally designed to be unfixable. This forces the model to learn the limits of its correction ability.

**Pseudocode (Evaluation Pipeline):**

```
function evaluate_robustness(original_code, mutation_rate):
  mutated_code = apply_mutations(original_code, mutation_rate)
  predicted_edits = bug_fixing_model(mutated_code)
  fixed_code = apply_edits(mutated_code, predicted_edits)
  original_results = run_tests(original_code)
  fixed_results = run_tests(fixed_code)
  robustness_score = compare_results(original_results, fixed_results)
  return robustness_score, fixed_code
```

**Novelty:**

This goes beyond reactive bug fixing. It creates a proactive assessment of the model's resilience and ability to generalize, generating a quantifiable metric for code understanding and correction. By deliberately perturbing the code, we expose weaknesses in the model that wouldn't be revealed through traditional bug fixing exercises. It transforms the model from a 'repair shop' into a 'stress-tester' for code.
