## Dynamic Vocal Source Localization & Personalization

**Concept:** Extend beamforming beyond simple directional capture to create a personalized audio ‘bubble’ around each speaker, dynamically adjusting to their movements and vocal characteristics. This isn't just about isolating *who* is speaking, but *how* they speak, and tailoring the audio experience *to* that speaker.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Circular array with a minimum of 32 microphones, high SNR, and a sampling rate of 96 kHz. Microphones should be individually calibrated for phase and amplitude response.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated DSP or GPU with sufficient processing power for real-time beamforming, source localization, and signal processing.  Minimum 8 cores, 32 GB RAM.
*   **Speaker Identification Module:**  Small wearable (earbud, clip-on) containing a bone conduction microphone and Bluetooth transmitter.  Used for initial speaker enrollment and continuous voiceprint verification.
*   **Haptic Feedback System:** Optional - small vibratory motors embedded in the wearable to indicate localization accuracy & bubble boundary.

**II. Software Architecture:**

*   **Voiceprint Enrollment:**
    *   User speaks a standardized phrase multiple times.
    *   AI model extracts unique vocal features (formants, pitch contours, spectral envelope) and creates a voiceprint profile.
*   **Real-time Source Localization:**
    *   **Phase-Based Beamforming:** Initial beamforming to identify potential sound sources.
    *   **Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) Estimation:**  Calculate TDoA between microphone pairs to estimate source position.  Utilize Generalized Cross Correlation (GCC-PHAT) for robust TDoA estimation in noisy environments.
    *   **Kalman Filter Tracking:**  Track source position over time using a Kalman filter to smooth trajectories and predict future positions.
    *   **Voiceprint Verification:**  Continuously compare incoming audio from the localized source to the enrolled voiceprint.  Alert system if mismatch occurs.
*   **Dynamic ‘Audio Bubble’ Creation:**
    *   **Bubble Radius:** Adjustable parameter (1-3 meters) defining the extent of the personalized audio zone.
    *   **Beamforming Steering:**  Dynamically steer the beamforming array to focus on the localized speaker's position, creating a narrow zone of high audio fidelity.
    *   **Noise Cancellation:**  Apply aggressive noise cancellation to signals originating from outside the bubble.
    *   **Reverberation Control:** Use adaptive filtering to minimize reverberation within the bubble.
*   **Personalized Audio Shaping:**
    *   **Frequency Response Equalization:**  Apply personalized EQ based on the speaker’s auditory profile (determined during enrollment).
    *   **Dynamic Range Compression:**  Adjust dynamic range compression based on the speaker’s speech dynamics.
    *   **Virtual Spatialization:**  Create a virtual spatial soundscape around the speaker (optional).

**III. Pseudocode – Real-time Source Localization & Bubble Steering:**

```
// Initialization
enrollSpeaker()
createAudioBubble(radius)

// Real-time Loop
while (true) {
    audioData = captureAudio()
    sourcePosition = estimateSourcePosition(audioData)
    verifySpeaker(sourcePosition, audioData)

    if (speakerVerified) {
        steerBeamformingArray(sourcePosition)
        applyNoiseCancellation()
        applyPersonalizedAudioShaping()
    } else {
        resetBeamformingArray()
    }
}

// Functions
estimateSourcePosition(audioData) {
    // Apply beamforming
    // Calculate TDoA
    // Kalman Filter Tracking
    return position
}

verifySpeaker(position, audioData) {
    // Extract vocal features from audioData
    // Compare to enrolled voiceprint
    return verificationResult
}

steerBeamformingArray(position) {
    // Calculate beamforming weights based on position
    // Apply weights to microphone signals
}
```

**IV.  Expansion:**

Future iterations should investigate using generative AI to create personalized audio filters based on speaker affect/emotional state, dynamically adapting the audio bubble based on conversation context.
