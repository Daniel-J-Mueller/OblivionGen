## Dynamic Network Access Control Based on Behavioral Biometrics

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Edge computing device (integrated into base stations or CPE), central server with scalable storage and processing, compatible with existing cellular network infrastructure. Device must support real-time data processing and machine learning inference.
*   **Software:** Machine learning models for behavioral biometrics (keystroke dynamics, app usage patterns, network traffic analysis), real-time data ingestion pipeline, policy engine, network access control module, secure communication protocols.
*   **Data Sources:** Call Detail Records (CDRs), application usage data, network traffic metadata (packet size, inter-packet timing, protocol types), device motion data (accelerometer, gyroscope – opt-in), location data (coarse-grained – opt-in).

**Innovation Description:**

This system creates a dynamic network access control layer based on *behavioral biometrics*. It moves beyond simple data usage thresholds to establish a baseline of “normal” network behavior for each user/device. Deviations from this baseline trigger adaptive network restrictions.

1.  **Baseline Creation:** Upon initial network connection, the system passively collects data about user/device network behavior (application usage, data transfer patterns, timing characteristics).  A behavioral profile is created using machine learning (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, recurrent neural networks). This profile represents the user's typical network “fingerprint”.
2.  **Real-time Anomaly Detection:** Incoming network traffic is continuously analyzed and compared to the established behavioral profile.  Statistical methods and machine learning algorithms identify anomalies – unusual application usage, atypical data transfer rates, or deviations in network timing.
3.  **Adaptive Network Restrictions:**  Based on the severity of the anomaly, the system dynamically adjusts network access.  
    *   **Low Severity:** Temporary throttling of non-essential applications.  Alert sent to the user.
    *   **Medium Severity:** Restriction of access to specific application categories (e.g., social media, streaming video). User prompted for verification.
    *   **High Severity:** Complete network disconnection.  Automated fraud reporting.
4.  **Continuous Learning:** The system continuously learns and adapts to evolving user behavior. The behavioral profile is updated over time, improving the accuracy of anomaly detection.
5.  **Privacy Considerations:**  All data collection is performed with user consent.  Data is anonymized and encrypted.  Users have the ability to review and control their data.

**Pseudocode – Anomaly Detection Module:**

```
function detectAnomaly(networkTrafficData, userProfile) {
  // Feature Extraction
  features = extractFeatures(networkTrafficData);  // Example: data rate, packet size distribution, app usage frequency

  // Calculate Anomaly Score
  anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(features, userProfile); // Using statistical distance or machine learning model

  // Threshold Comparison
  if (anomalyScore > threshold) {
    anomalyDetected = true;
    severity = determineSeverity(anomalyScore);
  } else {
    anomalyDetected = false;
    severity = "Normal";
  }

  return { anomalyDetected, severity };
}

function determineSeverity(anomalyScore) {
  if (anomalyScore > 0.9) {
    return "High";
  } else if (anomalyScore > 0.5) {
    return "Medium";
  } else {
    return "Low";
  }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Fraud Prevention
*   Data Leakage Prevention
*   Account Takeover Protection
*   Automated Threat Response
*   QoS Management
