## Adaptive Content Mirroring & Personalized Spatial Audio

**Concept:** Extend proximity detection beyond simple pausing/stopping of content. Instead, leverage multi-device proximity data to create a dynamic “content mirror” and deliver personalized spatial audio experiences based on user location *within* a space.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Proximity Sensor Network:** Each device (TV, speaker, mobile device) must incorporate a combination of sensors:
    *   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons for coarse location.
    *   Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio for precise indoor positioning (accuracy < 30cm).
    *   Optional: Low-resolution cameras for object/person recognition (to aid in UWB signal filtering).
*   **Spatial Audio System:** Support for object-based audio formats (Dolby Atmos, DTS:X) and a multi-speaker configuration (minimum 5.1.2).
*   **Processing Unit:** A central hub (likely integrated into the TV or a dedicated device) with sufficient processing power to handle proximity data, audio rendering, and content switching.
*   **Network Connectivity:** High-bandwidth, low-latency Wi-Fi 6E or equivalent.

**2. Software & Algorithms:**

*   **Proximity Data Fusion:** Algorithm to combine data from multiple sensors (BLE, UWB, cameras) to create a real-time map of user locations within a defined space. Kalman filtering or similar techniques for smoothing and predicting user movement.
*   **Spatial Audio Rendering Engine:** Advanced rendering engine capable of dynamically adjusting audio parameters (volume, panning, equalization, reverberation) based on user location. Utilize Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) for personalized audio experiences.
*   **Content Mirroring Logic:**
    *   **Seamless Handoff:**  As a user moves between devices (e.g., from TV to tablet), the content seamlessly transitions without interruption. The central hub manages content buffering and synchronization.
    *   **Adaptive Content Resolution:** Dynamically adjust content resolution/quality based on the device being used. (e.g. 4K to TV, 1080p to tablet).
    *   **Multi-Perspective Viewing:**  Allow multiple users to view the same content from different perspectives simultaneously (e.g. sports broadcasts with personalized camera angles).
*   **User Profile Management:**  Store user preferences (audio settings, preferred viewing angles) to personalize the experience.
*   **Privacy Controls:**  Provide users with granular control over data collection and sharing.

**3. Pseudocode - Core Logic:**

```
// Main Loop - Runs on Central Hub

while (true) {

    // 1. Collect Proximity Data
    proximityData = collectProximityDataFromDevices(); // Returns list of {deviceID, userID, x, y, z}

    // 2.  User Tracking & Mapping
    userLocations = trackUserLocations(proximityData); //Updates user locations in a spatial map

    // 3. Content Selection & Control
    for each (user in userLocations) {
      closestDevice = findClosestDevice(user.location);
      if(user.content != closestDevice.content){
           streamContentToDevice(closestDevice, user.content);
      }

      //Spatial Audio Adjustment
      spatialAudioParams = calculateSpatialAudioParams(user.location);
      sendSpatialAudioParamsToDevice(closestDevice, spatialAudioParams);
    }

    // Sleep for a short duration (e.g., 10ms)
}

// Function: calculateSpatialAudioParams(userLocation)
//  - Determines optimal volume, panning, and equalization settings based on user location and room acoustics.
//  - Uses HRTFs to personalize audio experience.
```

**4. Use Cases:**

*   **Home Entertainment:** Seamless content transition between TV, tablet, and mobile devices. Personalized spatial audio for immersive experiences.
*   **Retail:** Targeted advertising based on customer location within a store. Interactive displays that respond to user proximity.
*   **Museums/Exhibits:**  Personalized audio guides and interactive displays that adapt to visitor location.
*   **Smart Offices:**  Automated content sharing and presentation based on meeting participant location.
