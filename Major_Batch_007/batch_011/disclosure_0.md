## Dynamic Bioluminescence Integration

**Concept:** Integrate genetically engineered bioluminescent bacteria *within* the glass envelope of the light bulb, creating a living light source that shifts and changes based on environmental factors and internal bacterial processes.

**Specs:**

1.  **Bacterial Strain:** *Aliivibrio fischeri* (or similar) genetically modified for increased light output, extended lifespan within a confined space, and sensitivity to specific wavelengths of external light/vibration.  Encapsulation strategy crucial (see #4).
2.  **Nutrient Matrix:** A clear, biocompatible gel (agarose or similar) infused with essential nutrients for bacterial survival (glucose, amino acids, trace elements). Gel must be UV transparent to allow external light to influence bioluminescence.  Gel concentration optimized for diffusion of nutrients and waste products.
3.  **Envelope Construction:** The bulb envelope will be constructed in two parts:
    *   **Inner Sphere:** A borosilicate glass sphere containing the nutrient matrix and bioluminescent bacteria.  Surface treatment to enhance bacterial adhesion and prevent clumping.
    *   **Outer Shell:** A transparent, impact-resistant polymer shell (polycarbonate or acrylic) enclosing the inner sphere.  This creates a sealed environment and provides structural support.  The space between the inner sphere and outer shell will be filled with an inert gas (argon) to further enhance light output and prevent oxidation.
4.  **Encapsulation Strategy:** Bacteria will *not* be free-floating. They will be embedded within microcapsules constructed from a semi-permeable polymer (alginate or chitosan).  Each microcapsule will allow for nutrient/waste exchange, but prevent bacterial leakage in case of envelope fracture.  Microcapsule size optimized for light transmission.
5.  **Stimuli Response:** Incorporate light sensors and vibration sensors into the polymer shell. These sensors will regulate the bacterial growth rate and bioluminescence intensity.  
    *   **Light-Based Control:** Exposure to specific wavelengths of light will trigger increased or decreased bioluminescence.  Create 'mood lighting' presets using pre-programmed light sequences.
    *   **Vibration-Based Control:** Sound or physical vibrations will alter bioluminescence intensity, creating a 'living' response to the environment. 
6.  **Lifespan & Replenishment:** Expect bacterial lifespan to be limited (estimated 6-12 months). Design bulb with a replaceable nutrient cartridge. Cartridge replacement will introduce fresh nutrients and a controlled dose of new bacteria to rejuvenate light output.
7.  **Power Source:** While bioluminescence itself doesn't *require* electricity, a low-voltage power supply will be needed for the sensors, control circuitry, and potential external light stimulation. 

**Pseudocode (Control Logic):**

```
// Initialize sensors and light control parameters

loop {
  readLightSensorValue()
  readVibrationSensorValue()

  if (lightSensorValue > threshold_blue) {
    increaseBioluminescenceIntensity()
  } else if (lightSensorValue > threshold_red) {
    decreaseBioluminescenceIntensity()
  }

  if (vibrationSensorValue > threshold_high) {
    pulseBioluminescenceIntensity() // Rapidly increase/decrease
  } else if (vibrationSensorValue > threshold_low) {
    subtleBioluminescenceShift() // Gradual color/intensity change
  }

  monitorNutrientLevels()
  if (nutrientLevels < threshold_low) {
    alertUserReplaceCartridge()
  }
}
