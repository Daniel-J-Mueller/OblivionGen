## Adaptive Topology Ring Oscillator Array

**Concept:** Expand the ring oscillator concept beyond simply varying loop counts or multiplexer selections. Implement a physically reconfigurable array of ring oscillators where the *connectivity* of the elements changes dynamically, not just the configuration *within* each oscillator.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Size:** 8x8 array of ring oscillator elements. Each element contains an inverter and a multiplexer.
*   **Connectivity:** Each element has 4 bidirectional ports, allowing it to connect to its immediate neighbors (North, South, East, West).
*   **Switching Fabric:** Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based switches at each port. These switches enable/disable connections between elements. Each switch is individually addressable.
*   **Control:** A central control unit manages the switching fabric, defining the topology of the array. The control unit is programmable and can implement arbitrary topologies.
*   **Operating Modes:**
    *   **Grid Mode:** Standard grid-like topology. Useful for initial entropy accumulation.
    *   **Tree Mode:** Hierarchical tree topology. Allows for complex signal propagation and entropy focusing.
    *   **Mesh Mode:** Fully connected mesh topology. Maximizes connectivity and entropy mixing.
    *   **Custom Mode:** User-defined topology specified via a software interface.
*   **Entropy Accumulation Phase:** Array initialized in Grid Mode to promote initial entropy.
*   **Phase Lock Breaking:** Topology dynamically changed via the control unit to Mesh, Tree, or a user-defined configuration. The dynamic changes act as a far stronger 'break' than merely altering internal configurations.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** A feedback loop monitors the output entropy of the array. The control unit adjusts the topology in real-time to optimize entropy generation and randomness.
*   **Power Management:** Individual elements and switches are power-gated when not in use to minimize power consumption.

**Pseudocode (Topology Update):**

```
FUNCTION UpdateTopology(target_topology, entropy_feedback)

    // Calculate difference between current topology and target topology
    topology_difference = CalculateTopologyDifference(current_topology, target_topology)

    // Determine switch activation/deactivation sequence
    switch_sequence = GenerateSwitchSequence(topology_difference)

    // Apply switch sequence
    FOR each switch in switch_sequence:
        Activate/Deactivate Switch(switch)

    // Monitor entropy feedback
    current_entropy = MeasureEntropy()

    // Adjust topology based on feedback
    IF current_entropy < threshold:
        Increase Topology Complexity
    ELSE IF current_entropy > threshold:
        Decrease Topology Complexity

    current_topology = target_topology

END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This approach goes beyond varying the internal configuration of ring oscillators. It introduces a physically reconfigurable array that allows for dynamic adjustment of the *network* itself, drastically increasing the complexity and unpredictability of the entropy source. It shifts the focus from static randomization to dynamic, network-level randomness.
