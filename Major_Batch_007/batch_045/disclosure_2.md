## Dynamic Trust-Weighted Recommendation Ecosystem

**Concept:** Expand the trust level system beyond individual member weighting to a dynamic ecosystem where trust propagates based on recommendation agreement *and* subsequent user action. This aims to create a self-correcting, more accurate trust network.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Structures:**

*   `User`: (Existing) Stores user profile, purchase/view history.
*   `Item`: (Existing) Stores item details, associated categories.
*   `Recommendation`: Stores recommendation details (user, item, timestamp, source – see below).
*   `TrustNode`: Represents a user within the trust network. Stores:
    *   `UserID`: Link to `User` record.
    *   `TrustScore`: Base score (initial/default).
    *   `CategoryTrust`: Dictionary mapping item categories to category-specific trust scores.
    *   `AgreementCount`: Number of times this user’s recommendations have been positively agreed with.
    *   `DisagreementCount`: Number of times this user’s recommendations have been negatively disagreed with.
    *   `ConnectedNodes`: List of `TrustNode` IDs representing users this node has interacted with (agreed/disagreed with).

**II. Recommendation Source:**

*   Extend the `Recommendation` object to include:
    *   `SourceType`: (e.g., "SocialNetwork", "Unfiltered", "Ecosystem"). "Ecosystem" indicates a recommendation originating from the trust-weighted system.
    *   `SourceNodeID`: ID of the `TrustNode` originating the recommendation.

**III. Ecosystem Recommendation Generation:**

1.  **Node Selection:** When generating recommendations for a user:
    *   Identify a set of potential `TrustNode`s within the user's social network and beyond (based on similar purchase history, demographic data, etc.).
    *   Rank these nodes based on a combination of:
        *   `TrustScore`.
        *   `CategoryTrust` (relevant to the item being recommended).
        *   Recency of positive/negative interactions with the target user.
2.  **Recommendation Aggregation:**
    *   Each selected `TrustNode` generates a ranked list of potential items based on its own preferences and purchase history.
    *   Aggregate these ranked lists, weighting each node's list by its calculated trust score.
    *   Generate a final ranked list of recommendations.
3.  **Feedback Loop:**
    *   When a user interacts with a recommendation (purchases, views, reviews), update the trust scores of the originating `TrustNode`s.
    *   *Positive Interaction*: Increase `AgreementCount` and `TrustScore`. Propagate a small trust increase to the node’s connections (nodes it has previously agreed with).
    *   *Negative Interaction*: Increase `DisagreementCount` and decrease `TrustScore`.  Propagate a small trust decrease to the node’s connections.
    *   Apply decay factors to ensure that old interactions have less impact.

**IV. Pseudocode - Ecosystem Recommendation Generation**

```pseudocode
function generateEcosystemRecommendations(userID, itemCategory, numRecommendations):
  // 1. Identify potential TrustNodes
  potentialNodes = findRelevantTrustNodes(userID, itemCategory)

  // 2. Rank TrustNodes based on TrustScore and CategoryTrust
  rankedNodes = sort(potentialNodes, by: TrustScore + CategoryTrust)

  // 3. Generate individual recommendation lists from each node
  nodeRecommendations = []
  for node in rankedNodes:
    recommendations = generateRecommendationsFromNode(node) //existing function, refined
    nodeRecommendations.append(recommendations)

  // 4. Aggregate recommendations, weighted by TrustScore
  aggregatedRecommendations = {}
  for recommendations in nodeRecommendations:
    for item, score in recommendations:
      if item in aggregatedRecommendations:
        aggregatedRecommendations[item] += score * getNodeTrustScore(node)
      else:
        aggregatedRecommendations[item] = score * getNodeTrustScore(node)

  // 5. Sort and return top N recommendations
  sortedRecommendations = sort(aggregatedRecommendations, by: score, descending: true)
  return topN(sortedRecommendations, numRecommendations)
```

**V. Refinements:**

*   **Trust Decay:** Implement a decay mechanism for TrustScores to account for changes in user preferences over time.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify and flag TrustNodes exhibiting unusual behavior (e.g., consistently recommending low-quality items).
*   **Category Specialization:** Allow TrustNodes to specialize in specific item categories, further refining the accuracy of recommendations.
*   **Dynamic Network Growth:**  Enable the trust network to expand organically by allowing users to connect with each other based on shared preferences.
