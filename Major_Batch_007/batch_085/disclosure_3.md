## Adaptive Resource Group 'Shadowing' & Predictive Migration

**Concept:** Extend the resource group comparison/migration functionality to include a 'shadow' resource group that proactively learns from the primary group, allowing for near-instantaneous migration in response to predicted performance dips or cost increases. This goes beyond reactive switching to *predictive* adaptation.

**Specifications:**

**I. Shadow Resource Group Creation & Initialization:**

1.  **Trigger:** Automatically create a shadow resource group when a primary resource group is established.
2.  **Configuration Mirroring:** Initially mirror the primary group’s configuration (instance types, software versions, networking).  Record all configuration parameters.
3.  **Data Collection Start:** Begin collecting the *same* computing usage metrics and user-defined metrics as the primary group. *Also* collect detailed system logs (CPU utilization, memory access patterns, network I/O) from the primary group.
4.  **Initial 'Cold' Training Phase:**  The shadow group remains idle (or runs a minimal workload) for a defined ‘cold’ training period (e.g., 24-48 hours). During this time, it receives and analyzes the primary group’s data to build a performance/cost model.  This is essential for calibration.

**II. Predictive Modeling & Anomaly Detection:**

1.  **Model Building:** Employ machine learning (time series forecasting, regression) to create a predictive model of the primary group’s performance (latency, throughput) and cost, *based on* the collected metrics and system logs.  This model should predict future values with a defined confidence interval.
2.  **Anomaly Detection:** Continuously monitor the primary group’s *actual* performance and cost against the model’s predictions.  Identify anomalies (significant deviations from predicted values).  Use a statistical threshold for anomaly determination (e.g., 3 standard deviations).
3.  **Root Cause Analysis (Simplified):**  While not fully comprehensive, attempt to identify likely root causes of anomalies.  Correlate anomalies with specific system logs (e.g., increased disk I/O, network latency spikes).

**III. Proactive Migration & Load Balancing:**

1.  **Migration Threshold:** Define a 'migration threshold' based on the severity and persistence of anomalies. If the predicted performance/cost of the primary group falls *below* this threshold, trigger a migration.
2.  **Warm-Up Phase:** Before fully switching traffic, initiate a 'warm-up' phase for the shadow group. Route a *small* percentage of traffic to the shadow group to allow it to adjust to the live load.
3.  **Traffic Shifting:** Gradually shift traffic from the primary group to the shadow group, monitoring performance and cost at each step. Use a load balancer to manage the traffic shift.
4.  **Primary Group Standby:**  Once the shadow group is handling the full load, put the primary group into a standby mode. It remains configured but receives minimal traffic.
5.  **Continuous Learning:** The shadow group *continues* to learn from the live load, refining its predictive model. It now becomes the new primary group, and a *new* shadow group is created.

**IV. Pseudocode (Migration Trigger):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION CheckMigrationTrigger(primaryMetrics, predictedMetrics, anomalyThreshold):
    // Calculate deviation between actual and predicted values
    deviation = ABS(primaryMetrics - predictedMetrics)

    // Check if deviation exceeds the threshold
    IF deviation > anomalyThreshold THEN
        // Trigger migration process
        InitiateMigration()
        RETURN TRUE
    ELSE
        RETURN FALSE
    ENDIF
```

*   Sufficient compute resources to run both primary and shadow resource groups.
*   Load balancer capable of dynamic traffic shifting.
*   Machine learning platform for model training and anomaly detection.
*   Monitoring tools for collecting metrics and system logs.
*   Automated orchestration tools for managing resource group creation, configuration, and migration.
