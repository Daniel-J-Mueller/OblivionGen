## Adaptive Radiance Mapping for Multi-Camera Systems

**Concept:** Extend the single-camera radiance detection to a networked multi-camera system, creating a dynamic radiance map of an environment. This map isn't just *detecting* sunlight, but *modeling* light distribution and predicting overexposure *before* it happens, enabling proactive camera adjustments or object repositioning.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Nodes:** Multiple cameras (minimum 3), each with onboard processing capable of running radiance detection algorithms (as per the provided patent).
*   **Central Coordinator:** A dedicated processing unit (edge server or cloud-based) responsible for aggregating radiance data from all cameras and constructing the environmental radiance map.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Low-latency, high-bandwidth communication between cameras and the central coordinator (e.g., 5G, Wi-Fi 6E, wired Ethernet).

**2. Data Acquisition & Processing:**

*   **Individual Camera Radiance Calculation:** Each camera calculates a local radiance value (using the patentâ€™s method), and importantly, also sends *raw image data* (or a compressed version) to the central coordinator.
*   **Coordinate Transformation:** Each camera's field of view is defined and mapped onto a 3D coordinate system managed by the central coordinator. This requires initial calibration using known markers or feature detection.
*   **Radiance Map Construction:**
    *   The central coordinator receives raw image data and radiance values from all cameras.
    *   Using the camera coordinate transformations, the system "projects" radiance values onto the 3D space.
    *   Radiance values from overlapping camera views are averaged or blended, using a weighting function based on camera distance, angle, and image quality.  A Bayesian approach to combining data is preferred.
    *   This creates a volumetric radiance map representing the light intensity at any point in the monitored area.
*   **Predictive Overexposure Modeling:**
    *   Based on the radiance map, the system can predict potential overexposure *before* it occurs. This requires modeling the relationship between radiance intensity, camera parameters (integration time, gain), and predicted pixel values.
    *   A machine learning model (trained on historical data) can be used to refine these predictions, accounting for environmental factors like atmospheric conditions and object reflectivity.

**3. Actionable Insights & Control:**

*   **Dynamic Camera Parameter Adjustment:** The system automatically adjusts camera parameters (integration time, gain) to optimize image quality and prevent overexposure, based on the predicted radiance values.
*   **Object Repositioning Guidance:** The system provides guidance (visual or automated) on repositioning objects within the monitored area to minimize sunlight exposure.  This is particularly useful in environments with movable objects (e.g., robotic arms, conveyor belts).
*   **Adaptive Lighting Control:** Integration with smart lighting systems to dynamically adjust ambient lighting levels to compensate for sunlight variations.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Detect sudden changes in radiance levels, indicating potential events like the ignition of a fire or the appearance of a bright light source.

**4. Pseudocode (Radiance Map Update):**

```
// For each camera:
ReceiveImageData(cameraID)
ReceiveRadianceValue(cameraID)

// For each pixel in ImageData:
    3DPoint = PixelTo3DPoint(pixelCoordinates, cameraID)
    RadianceAtPoint = RadianceValue + (LocalRadianceMap[3DPoint] * weight)
    LocalRadianceMap[3DPoint] = RadianceAtPoint // update local map.

// Merge Local Maps (with weighting) to create Global Radiance Map
```

**5. Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-resolution cameras with adjustable integration time and gain.
*   Edge computing devices with sufficient processing power and memory.
*   High-bandwidth network infrastructure.
*   Calibration markers or feature detection system.

**6. Future Enhancements:**

*   Integration with weather forecasting data to anticipate sunlight variations.
*   Implementation of advanced rendering techniques to visualize the radiance map in real-time.
*   Development of a user interface for monitoring and controlling the system.
