## Dynamic Policy Orchestration via Predictive Resource Modeling

**Specification:** A system for proactively adjusting authorization policies based on predicted resource consumption, utilizing time-series forecasting and a dynamic graph structure.

**Core Innovation:**  Instead of solely reacting to authorization requests and evaluating policies at that moment, this system *predicts* future resource needs based on historical usage patterns, current system load, and the *type* of operation being requested.  It then dynamically adjusts authorization policies *before* the operation is fully initiated, preemptively granting or restricting access to optimize resource allocation.

**System Components:**

1.  **Resource Historian:**  Collects time-series data on resource usage (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, disk I/O, specific service metrics) associated with each type of operation and user.

2.  **Predictive Model:**  Employs time-series forecasting algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict future resource demand for a given operation type, user, and time window.  Model selection is automated based on historical forecast accuracy.

3.  **Policy Graph:**  Extends the authorization data structure from the reference patent. The graphâ€™s nodes represent not just service operations, but also *resource constraints* (e.g., "CPU usage < 80%", "Network Bandwidth > 10 Mbps"). Edges represent relationships between operations, resources, and policies. Crucially, edge weights are *dynamic* and adjusted by the Predictive Model.

4.  **Policy Orchestrator:**  Monitors incoming operation requests. Based on the request, the Orchestrator:
    *   Queries the Predictive Model to obtain resource demand forecasts.
    *   Traverses the Policy Graph, considering the forecasted resource demand.
    *   Dynamically adjusts edge weights in the Policy Graph to reflect predicted resource contention. This influences the authorization outcome.
    *   Authorizes or denies the request based on the adjusted Policy Graph.
    *   Logs actual resource usage to refine the Predictive Model.

**Pseudocode (Policy Orchestrator):**

```
function authorize_request(request):
  operation_type = request.operation
  user_id = request.user
  forecasted_demand = PredictiveModel.predict(operation_type, user_id)
  policy_graph = load_policy_graph()

  // Update edge weights based on forecasted demand
  for each edge in policy_graph:
    if edge.resource_constraint:
      edge.weight = calculate_weight(edge.resource_constraint, forecasted_demand)

  // Traverse the Policy Graph to determine authorization
  authorization_result = traverse_graph(policy_graph, request)

  if authorization_result == authorized:
    log_resource_usage(request, actual_usage)
  else:
    deny_request(request)

function calculate_weight(resource_constraint, forecasted_demand):
  // Logic to adjust edge weight based on forecasted demand and resource constraint
  // Example: Higher forecasted demand -> lower weight (more restrictive)
  if forecasted_demand > resource_constraint.threshold:
    return resource_constraint.penalty
  else:
    return 1.0
```

**Novelty:**  The key difference from existing authorization systems is the *proactive* adjustment of policies based on *predicted* resource usage, rather than reactive evaluation. This allows for more efficient resource allocation and prevents resource contention before it occurs.  The Policy Graph's dynamic edge weights enable fine-grained control over authorization decisions based on forecasted demand.
