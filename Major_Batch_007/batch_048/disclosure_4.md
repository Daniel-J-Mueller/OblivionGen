## Adaptive Request Shaping with Predictive Client State

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting request characteristics *before* they reach the request router, based on predicted client state and anticipated back-end node capacity.

**Core Concept:** The current patent focuses on *reacting* to load. This builds on that by *proactively shaping* requests to avoid overload *before* it happens. It moves beyond simply choosing a node to *altering the request itself*.

**Components:**

*   **Client State Predictor (CSP):** A module residing on the client-side (browser, application) or a dedicated intermediary. It analyzes client behavior (recent requests, device type, network conditions, user interaction patterns) to predict upcoming request patterns. Outputs include:
    *   Request Volume (high, medium, low)
    *   Request Complexity (simple data fetch, complex computation)
    *   Acceptable Latency (strict, moderate, relaxed)
*   **Request Shaper (RS):**  A module (potentially integrated with the CSP) responsible for modifying requests *before* sending them.  It operates on the predicted client state and communicates with the request router to establish shaping parameters.
*   **Request Router Integration:** The existing request router is extended with an API to receive "shaping hints" from the Request Shaper.
*   **Back-end Node Capacity Predictor (BNCP):** A module running on the back-end that forecasts future capacity based on historical data, current load, and anticipated events (e.g., scheduled maintenance). This isn't strictly *necessary*, but improves accuracy.

**Operation:**

1.  **Prediction:** The CSP predicts the client's upcoming request characteristics.
2.  **Shaping Parameter Negotiation:** The CSP/RS communicates with the request router (via a new API) proposing shaping parameters based on the prediction. These parameters include:
    *   **Data Granularity:** Requesting only necessary data fields (reducing payload size).
    *   **Computation Offload:** Offloading simple computations to the client.
    *   **Caching Hints:**  Indicating data the client can cache locally.
    *   **Request Throttling:**  Suggesting a maximum request rate.
    *   **Compression Level:**  Adjusting data compression.
3.  **Router Adjustment:** The request router adjusts the request based on the shaping parameters.
4.  **Node Selection:** The standard load balancing algorithm is applied.
5.  **Back-end Processing:** The back-end node processes the adjusted request.

**Pseudocode (Request Shaper):**

```
function shapeRequest(request, clientState) {
    predictedVolume = clientState.predictRequestVolume()
    predictedComplexity = clientState.predictRequestComplexity()
    acceptableLatency = clientState.predictAcceptableLatency()

    shapingParams = {}

    if (predictedVolume == "high") {
        shapingParams.requestRateLimit = 5  // Requests per second
    }

    if (predictedComplexity == "complex") {
        shapingParams.computationOffload = true
    }

    if (acceptableLatency == "relaxed") {
        shapingParams.dataGranularity = "minimal"
        shapingParams.compressionLevel = "high"
    }

    // Communicate shaping params to request router
    sendShapingParams(shapingParams)

    // Modify request based on shaping params (example)
    if (shapingParams.dataGranularity == "minimal") {
        request.fields = request.fields.filter(field => field.essential)
    }
    
    return request
}
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond passive load balancing to *proactive request optimization*. It addresses overload *before* it occurs by tailoring requests to the client's needs and the back-end's capacity.  It is adaptive, learning from client behavior and adjusting accordingly.  It isn’t about simply routing traffic – it’s about *shaping the traffic itself*. This could create a more efficient and responsive system.
