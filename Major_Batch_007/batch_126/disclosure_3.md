## Dynamic Feature Interaction Graphs

**Concept:** Extend the decoupled analysis beyond individual columns to analyze *relationships* between columns, constructing a dynamic graph of feature interactions. This allows the system to identify complex, non-linear feature combinations potentially predictive of a target variable *before* any model training.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Interaction Analyzer Module:**  A new analyzer module added to the existing architecture. This module doesn't operate on single columns, but on *pairs* or *triplets* of columns.  It generates "interaction facts" describing the relationship between the values in those columns. These facts could include correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman), mutual information, or statistical tests for association (e.g., Chi-squared).

2.  **Graph Construction Engine:**  A component responsible for building a directed graph. Nodes represent columns. Edges represent statistically significant interactions (determined by a user-defined threshold based on the interaction facts). Edge weight corresponds to the strength of the interaction.

3.  **Dynamic Graph Pruning:**  Introduce a pruning mechanism to manage graph complexity.  Based on the target variable (provided during graph construction - optionally a proxy for future tasks), employ a relevance scoring function to assess the importance of each edge.  Edges with low relevance scores are removed. This creates a smaller, more focused graph.

4.  **Graph-Based Feature Engineering Pipelines:** Interpretation engines are modified to consume the interaction graph.  Instead of generating pipelines for individual columns, they generate pipelines that leverage interactions:
    *   **Interaction Term Creation:**  Automatically create new features that are the product or sum of interacting columns (e.g., `feature_A * feature_B`).
    *   **Conditional Feature Application:** Generate pipelines that apply transformations to `feature_A` *only if* `feature_B` exceeds a certain threshold.  This creates highly tailored features based on column interactions.
    *   **Graph Embedding Pipeline:**  Utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) to create feature embeddings based on the graph structure. The node embeddings can then be used as features in downstream machine learning models.

5.  **Pipeline Prioritization:**  Assign a “complexity score” to each generated pipeline (based on the number of operations, transformations, and interactions).  Allow the user to specify a maximum complexity score, effectively filtering out overly complex pipelines.

**Pseudocode (Graph Construction):**

```
function build_interaction_graph(dataset, significance_threshold):
  graph = empty_graph()
  columns = dataset.columns()

  for col1 in columns:
    for col2 in columns:  // can extend to triplets/n-plets
      interaction_fact = calculate_interaction(col1, col2, dataset)
      if interaction_fact.significance > significance_threshold:
        edge = create_edge(col1, col2, interaction_fact.strength)
        graph.add_edge(edge)
  return graph
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `InteractionFact`: `{significance: float, strength: float, type: string}`.
*   `Edge`: `{source: string, destination: string, weight: float}`.
*   `Graph`:  Adjacency list/matrix representation.
