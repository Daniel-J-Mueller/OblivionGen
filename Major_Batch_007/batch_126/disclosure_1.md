## Adaptive Resource Sharding Based on Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the load balancer's ability to dynamically route traffic not just based on account pools and load, but also based on real-time behavioral biometrics of the user. This enables a significantly more granular level of security and resource allocation, improving performance for legitimate users and proactively mitigating malicious activity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Biometric Data Collection Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate with client-side data collection (JavaScript) to capture:
    *   Typing dynamics (key press duration, intervals, velocity)
    *   Mouse movements (speed, acceleration, patterns, hesitation)
    *   Scrolling behavior (speed, patterns)
    *   Touchscreen gestures (speed, pressure, complexity) - if applicable
*   **Data Preprocessing:**
    *   Noise filtering and outlier removal.
    *   Feature extraction: Convert raw data into quantifiable features.
    *   Normalization: Scale features to a consistent range.
*   **Data Transmission:** Securely transmit processed data to the load balancer via encrypted channels (TLS 1.3+). Minimize data transmission size through compression algorithms.

**2. Behavioral Profile Creation & Management:**

*   **User Profiles:** Maintain a behavioral profile for each authenticated user. The profile stores:
    *   Baseline behavioral data (established during initial sessions).
    *   Rolling averages of behavioral features.
    *   Deviation thresholds (calculated dynamically based on user behavior).
*   **Profile Learning:** Implement machine learning algorithms (e.g., anomaly detection, clustering) to:
    *   Continuously update the baseline profile.
    *   Detect deviations from normal behavior.
    *   Adapt to evolving user patterns.
*   **Profile Storage:** Store profiles in a secure, scalable database (e.g., Redis, Cassandra).

**3. Adaptive Resource Sharding Logic:**

*   **Real-time Anomaly Scoring:** Calculate an anomaly score for each request based on the deviation of the current behavioral data from the user’s profile.
*   **Sharding Categories:** Define multiple resource sharding categories based on anomaly score thresholds:
    *   **Tier 1 (Normal):**  Route requests to high-performance resources (e.g., in-memory caches, geographically closest servers).
    *   **Tier 2 (Suspicious):** Route requests to resources with increased security measures (e.g., stricter rate limiting, CAPTCHA challenges).
    *   **Tier 3 (High Risk):** Route requests to dedicated security analysis resources (e.g., sandboxing environments, intrusion detection systems).
*   **Dynamic Shard Assignment:** The load balancer dynamically assigns each request to the appropriate shard based on the user’s anomaly score.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Integrate with security systems to receive feedback on malicious activity. Use this feedback to refine anomaly detection models and adjust sharding categories.

**4. Pseudocode:**

```
// On Request Received
anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(request, user_profile)

if anomaly_score < threshold_1:
    shard = select_shard(shard_pool_1) // High Performance
elif anomaly_score < threshold_2:
    shard = select_shard(shard_pool_2) // Increased Security
else:
    shard = select_shard(shard_pool_3) // Security Analysis

forward_request_to_shard(shard, request)
```

**5. API Extensions:**

*   `/profiles/{user_id}`:  API for managing user profiles (creation, updates, retrieval).
*   `/anomalydetection/configure`: API for configuring anomaly detection settings (thresholds, algorithms).
*   `/health/anomalydetection`: Endpoint for monitoring the health of the anomaly detection system.

**6. Security Considerations:**

*   Protect user data with strong encryption (at rest and in transit).
*   Implement robust access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to user profiles.
*   Regularly audit the system for vulnerabilities and security flaws.
*   Anonymize or pseudonymize behavioral data whenever possible to protect user privacy.
