**Dynamic Contextual Border Generation – ‘Living Borders’**

**Concept:** Expand the concept of supplemental content within borders to create actively updating ‘living borders’ that respond to user interaction *and* external data streams.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion Modules:**
    *   **Real-time Sentiment Analysis:** Integrate a module that analyzes user facial expressions (via camera) and/or voice tone (via microphone) to determine emotional state.
    *   **External Data Feeds:** Connect to APIs providing live data streams – news, weather, stock prices, sports scores, social media trends – relevant to content being displayed.
    *   **Content Metadata Analysis:**  Deep dive into content metadata – genre, actors, location, historical context, associated themes – to identify relevant supplementary data.

*   **Border Generation Engine:**
    *   **Dynamic Layout System:**  The border isn’t a static area. It is divided into configurable ‘cells’ or ‘zones’ of varying size and shape.
    *   **Content Prioritization Algorithm:**  An AI-driven system that ranks the relevance and visual impact of potential supplemental content.  Factors include:  User emotional state, real-time data importance, content metadata relevance, aesthetic compatibility.
    *   **Visual Style Library:**  A collection of pre-defined border visual styles (minimalist, ornate, futuristic, etc.).  The style library is customizable via user preferences.
    *   **Animation/Transition Library:**  A collection of dynamic animations and transitions used to update border content smoothly and engagingly.

*   **Content Rendering Modules:**
    *   **Text Rendering:** Dynamic text display with adjustable fonts, colors, and animations.
    *   **Image/Video Rendering:** Support for displaying relevant images and short video clips within border cells.
    *   **Interactive Elements:**  Inclusion of clickable buttons or icons within the border to provide quick access to related information or services.

**Pseudocode – Main Loop:**

```
// Initialization: Load user preferences, visual style library

LOOP:
    // 1. Data Acquisition:
    user_emotion = analyze_user_emotion()
    external_data = fetch_relevant_data()
    content_metadata = analyze_content_metadata()

    // 2. Content Prioritization:
    prioritized_content = prioritize_content(user_emotion, external_data, content_metadata)

    // 3. Border Layout Generation:
    border_layout = generate_border_layout(prioritized_content, current_content_resolution)

    // 4. Content Rendering:
    render_border(border_layout, prioritized_content)

    // 5. Display Frame:
    display_frame(scaled_primary_content, rendered_border)

    // 6. Delay/Loop
    wait(frame_rate)
```

**Example Scenario:**

A user is watching a historical documentary. The ‘living border’ might display:

*   A real-time map showing the location depicted in the documentary.
*   Brief news headlines related to the historical event.
*   A ‘mood’ indicator reflecting the emotional tone of the scene (e.g., ‘tense’, ‘hopeful’).
*   If the user appears frustrated (based on facial expression analysis), the border might display a calming image or suggest taking a break.
