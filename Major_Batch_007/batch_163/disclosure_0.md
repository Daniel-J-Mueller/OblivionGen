## Dynamic Item ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Availability

**Concept:** Extend the system to not just *find* available items, but to create a real-time “shadow” inventory across multiple local merchants, and *predict* availability based on historical data and external factors. This moves beyond reactive searching to proactive fulfillment.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Aggregation Layer:** Expand data sources to include:
    *   Point-of-Sale (POS) data from willing merchants (API integration or secure data transfer).
    *   Real-time foot traffic data (aggregated, anonymized from mobile devices – opt-in required).
    *   Local event schedules (concerts, sporting events) impacting demand.
    *   Weather data (impacting demand for specific items – umbrellas, snow shovels, etc.).
    *   Social media trends (identifying emerging demands – e.g., a viral TikTok product).
*   **‘Shadow Inventory’ Database:** A geographically-indexed database containing:
    *   Reported inventory levels from merchants (POS data).
    *   Estimated inventory levels based on historical sales patterns (time of day, day of week, seasonality).
    *   Calculated probability of an item being in stock at a given merchant.
    *   Dynamic ‘heatmaps’ visually representing item availability across a city/region.
*   **Predictive Modeling Engine:**
    *   Machine learning algorithms to forecast demand for specific items at specific locations.
    *   Consideration of historical sales data, POS data, real-time foot traffic, event schedules, weather data, and social media trends.
    *   Output: Predicted probability of an item being available at a given merchant in the future (e.g., within the next hour, tomorrow).
*   **User Interface/API Integration:**
    *   Present predicted availability to users in real-time (e.g., "This item is likely in stock at Store A within 15 minutes").
    *   API access for third-party integrations (e.g., delivery services, online retailers).
*   **Automated "Scout" System:** Deploy virtual 'scouts' that continuously query merchants (via phone or app if available) to verify inventory levels and gather data that refines the predictive models. The voice recognition should *also* listen for price changes or promotional offers.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Availability Calculation):**

```
function calculate_predicted_availability(item_id, merchant_id, current_time):
  // Fetch historical sales data for item_id at merchant_id
  historical_data = fetch_historical_sales(item_id, merchant_id)

  // Fetch real-time foot traffic data for merchant_id
  foot_traffic = fetch_foot_traffic(merchant_id)

  // Fetch local event schedule for merchant_id
  events = fetch_local_events(merchant_id)

  // Fetch weather data for merchant_id
  weather = fetch_weather(merchant_id)

  // Calculate base probability based on historical data
  base_probability = calculate_base_probability(historical_data)

  // Adjust probability based on foot traffic
  foot_traffic_adjustment = calculate_foot_traffic_adjustment(foot_traffic)
  adjusted_probability = base_probability + foot_traffic_adjustment

  // Adjust probability based on events
  event_adjustment = calculate_event_adjustment(events)
  adjusted_probability = adjusted_probability + event_adjustment

  // Adjust probability based on weather
  weather_adjustment = calculate_weather_adjustment(weather)
  adjusted_probability = adjusted_probability + weather_adjustment

  // Cap probability at 1.0 and floor at 0.0
  predicted_probability = clamp(adjusted_probability, 0.0, 1.0)

  return predicted_probability
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus on *finding* what’s currently available. This goes further by *predicting* future availability, enabling proactive fulfillment and improved customer experience. This creates a continuously updating "digital twin" of local inventory, far beyond a simple search.
