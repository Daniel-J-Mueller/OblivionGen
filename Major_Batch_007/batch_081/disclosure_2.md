## Modular Kinetic Docking System

**Concept:** A device dock that isn’t *static*, but dynamically adjusts its interface to accommodate different devices *and* user preferences through small, controlled kinetic movements. Think beyond just physical connection; incorporate haptic feedback and subtle visual cues.

**Specs:**

*   **Base Unit:** Cylindrical base (10cm diameter, 5cm height) constructed of brushed aluminum. Internal weighted core for stability. Wireless charging coil integrated into the top surface.
*   **Kinetic “Petals”:** Six independently controlled "petals" extend from the base unit. Each petal is approximately 7cm long and 3cm wide. Constructed of a flexible, durable polymer with a soft-touch coating.
*   **Actuation:** Each petal driven by a miniature linear actuator (piezoelectric preferred for speed and precision) housed *within* the base unit.  Actuators controlled by a microcontroller (ESP32 or similar).
*   **Sensing:** Each petal incorporates a capacitive touch sensor and a force sensor. These sensors feed data to the microcontroller, allowing it to detect the presence, size, and shape of a device.
*   **Interface Adaptation – Algorithmic Control:**
    *   **Device Detection:** Upon sensing a device, the microcontroller initiates a scanning sequence. The petals *slowly* extend and retract, feeling for edges and contours.
    *   **Profile Matching:** The sensor data is compared to a pre-loaded database of device profiles (stored locally and updated via Wi-Fi).
    *   **Kinetic Adjustment:** Based on the profile match, the microcontroller commands the actuators to adjust the petals, forming a custom cradle for the device.
    *   **Haptic Confirmation:** When the cradle is formed, the petals gently “pulse” to provide tactile confirmation.
*   **User Customization:**
    *   **Profile Creation:** Users can define custom profiles for devices not in the database, "teaching" the dock the device's shape through manual petal adjustment.
    *   **Mood Lighting:** RGB LEDs integrated into each petal can be controlled via a mobile app, allowing for customizable lighting effects.
    *   **Gesture Control:** Capacitive touch sensors on the base allow for basic gesture control (e.g., swipe to change lighting mode).
*   **Power:** Powered by a standard USB-C connection. Supports Power Delivery for fast charging.
*   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n) for software updates and profile synchronization. Bluetooth 5.0 for mobile app control.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Actuation Control):**

```
FUNCTION adjustPetal(petalID, targetPosition):
  currentPosition = getPetalPosition(petalID)
  IF currentPosition < targetPosition:
    WHILE currentPosition < targetPosition:
      moveActuator(petalID, 1mm) // Small incremental movement
      currentPosition = getPetalPosition(petalID)
      delay(10ms)
  ELSE IF currentPosition > targetPosition:
    WHILE currentPosition > targetPosition:
      moveActuator(petalID, -1mm)
      currentPosition = getPetalPosition(petalID)
      delay(10ms)

FUNCTION createCradle(deviceProfile):
  FOR petalID = 1 TO 6:
    targetPosition = deviceProfile.petalPositions[petalID]
    adjustPetal(petalID, targetPosition)

//Example Usage:
deviceProfile = getDeviceProfile("iPhone 14")
createCradle(deviceProfile)
```
