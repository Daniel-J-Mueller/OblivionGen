## Predictive Proximity & Behavioral Modeling

**Concept:** Leverage presence detection data, not just for current location, but to *predict* likely future locations and behavioral patterns. This goes beyond simple presence/absence; it anticipates needs and proactively prepares environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Presence signals (as in the provided patent - regular interval & ad hoc)
    *   Historical location data (GPS, WiFi triangulation, Bluetooth beacons)
    *   Calendar data (user appointments, meetings)
    *   Device usage patterns (app usage, time of day)
    *   Environmental sensor data (temperature, lighting, sound)
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Behavioral Profile Creation:**  Establish a baseline behavioral profile for each user based on historical data. This profile includes common locations, routines, preferred environmental settings, and anticipated needs.  The system should use time series analysis and machine learning (e.g., recurrent neural networks) to model these patterns.
    *   **Predictive Modeling:** Based on the behavioral profile and real-time data, predict the user’s likely future location and activities.  This involves assigning probabilities to different potential outcomes.
    *   **Confidence Scoring:**  Assign a confidence score to each prediction based on the strength of the supporting data and the consistency with the behavioral profile.
    *   **Proactive Adjustment:**  Based on the predictions and confidence scores, proactively adjust the environment to meet the user’s anticipated needs. This could include:
        *   Pre-heating/cooling a room.
        *   Adjusting lighting levels.
        *   Preparing a presentation on a display.
        *   Initiating a frequently used app on a device.
        *   Preloading content (music, videos, documents).
        *   Adjusting smart home devices (coffee maker, thermostat).
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   **Edge Processing:** Initial data processing and basic prediction performed on edge devices (smartphones, smart speakers, IoT devices) to minimize latency and bandwidth usage.
    *   **Cloud Processing:** More complex analysis, behavioral profile management, and long-term data storage performed in the cloud.
    *   **API Integration:** Provide APIs for third-party developers to integrate the predictive proximity engine into their own applications.
*   **Pseudocode (Proactive Adjustment):**

```
FUNCTION ProactiveAdjustment(User, CurrentTime, CurrentLocation, Predictions)
    FOREACH Prediction IN Predictions
        IF Prediction.Confidence > Threshold
            IF Prediction.Action = "AdjustTemperature"
                AdjustTemperature(Prediction.TargetTemperature)
            ELSE IF Prediction.Action = "LoadPresentation"
                LoadPresentation(Prediction.PresentationFile)
            ELSE IF Prediction.Action = "StartApp"
                StartApp(Prediction.AppName)
            // ... other actions
        ENDIF
    ENDFOREACH
ENDFUNCTION
```

*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Time-series database optimized for storing and querying historical location and environmental data.
    *   User profile database to store behavioral profiles and preferences.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   Data encryption both in transit and at rest.
    *   User privacy controls to allow users to opt-in/out of data collection and sharing.
    *   Anonymization and aggregation of data to protect user privacy.
