## Dynamic Trust Score & Tiered Access

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple code verification to implement a dynamic trust score for devices accessing a user account, influencing access tiers and feature availability.

**Specs:**

*   **Trust Score Components:**
    *   *Verification Success Rate:* Track successful code verifications (like the patent details).
    *   *Device Health:* Integrate with device diagnostics (battery health, OS integrity, known vulnerabilities – accessed with user permission).
    *   *Usage Patterns:* Monitor typical usage times, locations, and application access. Deviations lower the score.
    *   *Network Signals:* Assess network security (public WiFi vs. private, VPN usage).
    *   *Biometric/Behavioral Data (Optional):* Incorporate user biometric or behavioral analysis (typing speed, swipe patterns) for further score refinement *with explicit user consent and data privacy safeguards*.
*   **Score Calculation:** Implement a weighted average formula for the Trust Score. Weights are configurable and adjustable via server-side parameters. The algorithm will be opaque to the end user.
*   **Access Tiers:** Define tiered access levels based on Trust Score ranges.
    *   *Tier 1 (High Trust - Score 80-100):* Full access to all features and content.
    *   *Tier 2 (Medium Trust - Score 50-79):* Access to core features. Limited access to sensitive content or functionalities. May require additional verification steps (multi-factor authentication) for certain actions.
    *   *Tier 3 (Low Trust - Score 0-49):* Restricted access. Limited functionality. Requires significant verification and may trigger security alerts.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Trust Score is *not* static. It adjusts continuously based on real-time data and user behavior.
*   **Alerting & Remediation:** Low Trust Scores trigger alerts to the user (via email/app notification) with suggestions for improving their score (e.g., update software, enable 2FA).
*   **Pseudocode – Trust Score Calculation:**

```
function calculateTrustScore(deviceId) {
  verificationSuccessRate = getVerificationSuccessRate(deviceId); // 0-1
  deviceHealthScore = getDeviceHealthScore(deviceId); // 0-1
  usagePatternScore = getUsagePatternScore(deviceId); // 0-1
  networkSignalScore = getNetworkSignalScore(deviceId); // 0-1
  biometricScore = getBiometricScore(deviceId); // 0-1 (optional)

  // Define Weights (Configurable)
  weightVerification = 0.3
  weightHealth = 0.2
  weightUsage = 0.2
  weightNetwork = 0.15
  weightBiometric = 0.15

  trustScore = (weightVerification * verificationSuccessRate) +
               (weightHealth * deviceHealthScore) +
               (weightUsage * usagePatternScore) +
               (weightNetwork * networkSignalScore) +
               (weightBiometric * biometricScore);

  trustScore = Math.min(100, Math.max(0, trustScore * 100)); // Scale to 0-100

  return trustScore;
}

function getAccessTier(trustScore) {
  if (trustScore >= 80) {
    return "Tier 1";
  } else if (trustScore >= 50) {
    return "Tier 2";
  } else {
    return "Tier 3";
  }
}
```

*   **Integration with Existing System:** This system seamlessly integrates with the passcode verification detailed in the patent. The Trust Score serves as an additional layer of security and access control *beyond* simple code matching.
*   **Server-Side Configuration:** All weights, thresholds, and parameters are configurable on the server side, allowing administrators to fine-tune the system's sensitivity and behavior.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  Data collection for Trust Score calculation must be transparent to the user, with clear opt-in/opt-out options and adherence to all relevant privacy regulations. Minimize data retention and anonymize data whenever possible.
