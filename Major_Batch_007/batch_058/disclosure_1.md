## Delegated Access with Temporal Policy Fragments

**Concept:** Extend the delegation model to incorporate *temporal policy fragments* â€“ small, time-bound access grants layered *on top* of the existing delegated permissions. This allows for highly granular, short-lived access control without altering the core, long-term delegated policy. Think 'just-in-time' or 'emergency' access.

**Specification:**

1.  **Fragment Creation API:** A new API endpoint for authorized administrators (or even delegated creators with limited scope) to define temporal policy fragments. Input parameters:
    *   `resource_id`: Identifier of the resource being accessed.
    *   `delegate_id`: Identifier of the delegate receiving the temporary access.
    *   `permissions`: List of permissions granted by the fragment (may be a subset or extension of existing delegated permissions).
    *   `start_time`:  Timestamp indicating when the fragment becomes active (UTC).
    *   `end_time`: Timestamp indicating when the fragment expires (UTC).
    *   `reason`: Textual justification for the fragment creation (for auditing).

2.  **Policy Resolution Engine Modification:** The existing policy resolution engine is modified to check for active temporal policy fragments *before* applying the core delegated policy.

    ```pseudocode
    function resolveAccess(resource_id, delegate_id, requested_permission) {
      // 1. Check for active temporal fragments
      active_fragments = getActiveTemporalFragments(resource_id, delegate_id);

      if (active_fragments.exists(fragment where fragment.permission == requested_permission)) {
        return ALLOW;
      }

      // 2. Resolve against the core delegated policy (as in the original patent)
      if (corePolicyAllows(delegate_id, resource_id, requested_permission)) {
        return ALLOW;
      }

      return DENY;
    }
    ```

3.  **Fragment Storage:** Temporal policy fragments are stored in a dedicated data store (e.g., time-series database) indexed by `resource_id`, `delegate_id`, `start_time`, and `end_time`.  Data store must support efficient querying for active fragments.

4.  **Auditing & Monitoring:**  All fragment creation, modification, and expiration events are logged for auditing. Real-time monitoring of active fragment counts and durations provides insight into temporary access patterns.

5.  **Automatic Expiration:** A scheduled process automatically removes expired fragments from the data store.  Cleanup should be idempotent.

6. **Delegation Chain Awareness:** The fragment resolution engine needs to understand the delegation chain.  If the delegate is itself a delegate, the fragment must be valid *in addition* to the policies inherited through the chain.

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Emergency Access:** Grant temporary access to a support engineer to troubleshoot a critical issue.
*   **Time-Limited Campaigns:**  Grant access to a marketing team to modify content for a specific campaign duration.
*   **Auditing & Compliance:**  Temporarily elevate permissions for auditors to access specific data sets.
