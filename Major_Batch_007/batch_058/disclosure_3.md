## Dynamic Predictive Mesh Network for Object Localization

**Concept:** Expand beyond stationary A/V devices to create a self-organizing, predictive mesh network using low-power, mobile “beacon” devices attached to tracked objects. This moves from reactive location to proactive anticipation.

**Specs:**

*   **Beacon Device:**
    *   Size: < 2cm x 2cm x 0.5cm
    *   Weight: < 10g
    *   Communication: Bluetooth 5.2, UWB (Ultra-Wideband)
    *   Power: Rechargeable via inductive charging. Estimated battery life: 72 hours.
    *   Sensors: 9-axis IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer), ambient light sensor, temperature sensor.
    *   Processor: Low-power ARM Cortex-M7.
    *   Storage: 8MB Flash Memory
*   **Network Nodes (Existing A/V Devices & New Mesh Nodes):**
    *   UWB Receiver/Transmitter
    *   Bluetooth Receiver/Transmitter
    *   Processing power to run predictive algorithms (described below).
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    1.  **Beacon Data Collection:** Each beacon continuously broadcasts its ID, IMU data, and ambient light/temperature readings.
    2.  **Mesh Network Formation:** Network nodes automatically discover and connect to nearby beacons and other nodes, forming a self-healing mesh network.
    3.  **Predictive Modeling:** Each node runs a localized Kalman filter or particle filter to predict the beacon’s future location based on historical movement data.
    4.  **Zone-Based Alerting:** Define “zones” within the environment. Nodes monitor predicted beacon trajectories and issue alerts *before* a tracked object enters or exits a zone.
    5.  **Dynamic Map Creation:** The system creates a dynamic map of the environment, incorporating beacon positions and movement patterns.
    6.  **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual movement patterns (e.g., rapid acceleration, unexpected direction changes) to trigger alerts.
    7.  **Federated Learning:** Each node locally trains its predictive model using its own data. Periodically, models are aggregated on a central server to improve overall accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Node Processing):**

```
LOOP:
    Receive Beacon Data
    Update Kalman Filter with New Data
    Predict Next Beacon Position
    Check if Predicted Position is Within Zone Boundaries
    IF Zone Boundary Crossed:
        Send Alert to Central Server & Mobile Client
    Update Dynamic Map with Predicted Position
    Train Local Predictive Model
    Periodically:
        Send Local Model to Central Server for Aggregation
        Receive Updated Global Model from Central Server
END LOOP
```

**Innovation:**

This design shifts from *finding* lost objects to *anticipating* where they will be. By leveraging a dynamic mesh network and predictive algorithms, the system can proactively alert users to potential issues before they occur.  The use of federated learning allows the system to continuously improve its accuracy without requiring centralized data storage. This system expands the scope of the patent from object retrieval to proactive security and management. Think pet monitoring, elderly care, inventory management, and theft prevention.
