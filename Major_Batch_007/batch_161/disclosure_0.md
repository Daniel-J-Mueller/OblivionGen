## Dynamic Acoustic Zoning

**Concept:** Implement a system that creates localized ‘acoustic zones’ within a room, dynamically adjusting audio output and noise cancellation to focus sound precisely on individual users, even in shared spaces. This expands on the idea of adjusting volume *before* a command, but instead of simple attenuation, it creates directional audio bubbles.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-element speaker array (minimum 8 speakers) – capable of beamforming and phased array techniques.
    *   High-sensitivity microphone array (minimum 4 microphones) – for sound source localization and noise profiling.
    *   Dedicated DSP (Digital Signal Processor) – for real-time audio processing.
    *   User tracking system – could integrate with existing camera systems or utilize UWB/Bluetooth for location awareness.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **User Localization:** Continuously track the location of each user within the space.
    *   **Acoustic Modeling:**  Create a real-time acoustic model of the environment, accounting for surfaces, obstacles, and background noise.
    *   **Beamforming & Phased Array Control:**  Utilize beamforming and phased array techniques to steer audio towards each user's location. This creates a focused "beam" of sound.
    *   **Noise Cancellation:** Implement adaptive noise cancellation, identifying and suppressing sounds originating *outside* of the user’s acoustic zone.
    *   **Dynamic Zone Adjustment:** Continuously adjust the size and shape of each acoustic zone based on user movement and changing environmental conditions.
    *   **Priority System:**  Allow users to prioritize their acoustic zone, increasing the focus and clarity of audio directed towards them.
    *   **'Whisper Mode'**:  An ultra-focused zone capable of delivering audio at extremely low volumes, perceivable only by the intended user.
*   **Operation:**
    1.  The system identifies the location of each user in the space.
    2.  Based on the user’s location and the acoustic model of the environment, the system creates a personalized acoustic zone around each user.
    3.  Audio content is directed towards each user's acoustic zone using beamforming and phased array techniques.
    4.  Adaptive noise cancellation suppresses sounds originating outside of the user’s zone.
    5.  The system continuously adjusts the acoustic zones based on user movement and changing environmental conditions.
*   **Pseudocode (Zone Adjustment):**

```
// UserMovementDetected(userID, newX, newY)
FUNCTION AdjustAcousticZone(userID, x, y)
    GET CurrentZoneParameters(userID)  //Get existing parameters: radius, center, shape
    CALCULATE NewZoneCenter(x, y)
    RESIZE ZoneRadius(userID) //Adjust based on proximity to other users
    UPDATE ZoneShape(userID) //Optimize for room geometry and obstacles
    APPLY BeamformingParameters(userID)
    APPLY NoiseCancellationProfile(userID)
END FUNCTION

// RoomConditionChangeDetected(obstacleAdded, soundEvent)
FUNCTION AdjustAllZones()
    FOR EACH UserID IN ActiveUsers
        RECALCULATE AcousticModel
        ADJUST ZoneShape(UserID)
        APPLY NoiseCancellationProfile(UserID)
    END FOR
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Open-plan offices – providing privacy and focused audio for each worker.
*   Shared living spaces – allowing multiple users to enjoy audio content without disturbing others.
*   Classrooms – delivering targeted audio to individual students.
*   Interactive exhibits – creating personalized audio experiences for visitors.
