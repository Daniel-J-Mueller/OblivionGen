## Dynamic Event Payload Reconstruction

**Specification:** A system for dynamically reconstructing event payloads based on receiver-specified requirements, decoupling event producers from detailed receiver needs.

**Concept:** The patent describes event handling within a visual scripting context, focusing on defining actions *in response* to events. This inspires a system where the event *itself* is not fixed, but rather assembled on the fly based on what the receiver requests. Think of it as "just-in-time" event data generation.

**Components:**

1.  **Event Schema Registry:** A central store defining potential data fields for all events within the system. Fields have data types and optional validation rules.  (e.g., `player_id: integer`, `location: vector3`, `item_type: enum`).
2.  **Event Producer:**  Responsible for emitting *base* event notifications – signals that *something* happened (e.g., "Player Moved", "Item Dropped").  These base events contain minimal information – enough to identify the event type.
3.  **Event Receiver:** Registers its data requirements with an Event Broker. The requirements are expressed as a list of desired fields from the Event Schema Registry.
4.  **Event Broker:**  The central routing and assembly point.  It receives base event notifications and receiver requirements.  It then queries the Event Schema Registry and dynamically builds the event payload according to the receiver’s specifications.
5.  **Data Source Adapters:** Modules responsible for sourcing data to populate the dynamic event payload. These adapters could connect to game state, databases, external APIs, or any other relevant data source.

**Workflow:**

1.  An event occurs in the game (e.g., Player Moved).
2.  The Event Producer emits a "Player Moved" base event.
3.  The Event Broker receives the base event.
4.  The Event Broker identifies registered receivers for "Player Moved" events.
5.  For each receiver, the Event Broker retrieves the receiver's requested data fields.
6.  The Event Broker uses Data Source Adapters to fetch the required data. (e.g., Player's current location, Player's speed, Timestamp).
7.  The Event Broker constructs a dynamic event payload containing the requested data.
8.  The Event Broker delivers the dynamic event payload to the receiver.

**Pseudocode (Event Broker):**

```
function handleEvent(baseEvent):
  receivers = getReceiversForEvent(baseEvent.eventType)

  for receiver in receivers:
    requestedFields = receiver.getRequestedFields()
    eventPayload = {}

    for fieldName in requestedFields:
      dataSource = getDataSourceForField(fieldName)
      if dataSource:
        fieldValue = dataSource.getData(baseEvent)
        eventPayload[fieldName] = fieldValue
      else:
        //Log error: Data source not found for field

    //Create complete event object
    event = {
      eventType: baseEvent.eventType,
      payload: eventPayload
    }

    deliverEvent(event, receiver)
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Network Bandwidth:** Only necessary data is transmitted.
*   **Decoupling:** Event producers don't need to know what data receivers need.
*   **Flexibility:** Receivers can request different data for the same event.
*   **Scalability:** Easily add new data fields without breaking existing systems.
*   **Adaptability:** Event payloads can evolve over time without requiring changes to producers or consumers.
