**Dynamic Resource Tag Inheritance & Predictive Scaling**

**Specification:**

**Core Concept:** Extend the resource tagging system to allow *inheritance* of tags between resources, combined with a predictive scaling engine that leverages tag-based resource behavior to proactively adjust capacity.

**Components:**

1.  **Tag Inheritance Engine:**
    *   Allows definition of parent-child relationships between resource tags.  For example, a tag "Environment:Production" could be a parent to "Service:Web" and "Database:MySQL".
    *   When a tag is applied to a parent, the system offers to propagate it to all child tags.  Optional manual override is always available.
    *   Inheritance is directional. A child tag cannot modify the parent tagâ€™s values.
    *   Configuration via API and GUI.  GUI displays tag inheritance graph.

2.  **Behavioral Profile Database:**
    *   A time-series database that stores resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O) *categorized by resource tag*.
    *   Data is collected passively from monitoring systems.
    *   Stores statistical data: mean, standard deviation, percentiles, and predictive models for resource demand based on tag combinations.  For example, the database learns that resources tagged "Environment:Production" and "Service:Web" exhibit a predictable spike in CPU usage between 9 AM and 11 AM.

3.  **Predictive Scaling Engine:**
    *   Analyzes the Behavioral Profile Database to forecast resource demand based on current tags.
    *   Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, regression) to predict future resource utilization.
    *   Can trigger automated scaling actions (e.g., launching new instances, adjusting instance sizes) to proactively meet anticipated demand.
    *   Scaling policies are defined based on tag combinations.  Example: "If resources tagged 'Environment:Production' and 'Service:Database' are predicted to exceed 80% CPU utilization in the next hour, add two new database instances."
    *   Supports both horizontal and vertical scaling.
    *   Provides a feedback loop:  actual resource utilization is used to refine the predictive models.

**API Endpoints:**

*   `POST /tags/{tagKey}/inheritance`: Define a parent-child relationship between tags.
*   `GET /tags/{tagKey}/children`: Retrieve a list of child tags.
*   `GET /tags/{tagKey}/parents`: Retrieve a list of parent tags.
*   `GET /predictions/{tagCombination}`: Retrieve predicted resource utilization for a specific tag combination.
*   `POST /scalingPolicies`: Create a new scaling policy based on tag combinations and predicted utilization.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Scaling Engine):**

```
function predictResourceUtilization(tagCombination, timeHorizon):
  // Query Behavioral Profile Database for historical data for tagCombination
  historicalData = queryDatabase(tagCombination)

  // Train a time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) using historicalData
  model = trainModel(historicalData)

  // Predict resource utilization for the next timeHorizon
  predictedUtilization = model.predict(timeHorizon)

  return predictedUtilization
```

**Workflow:**

1.  User applies tags to resources.
2.  Tag Inheritance Engine propagates tags as configured.
3.  Behavioral Profile Database collects resource utilization metrics categorized by tags.
4.  Predictive Scaling Engine analyzes tag combinations and predicts future resource demand.
5.  Based on scaling policies, the system automatically adjusts capacity to meet anticipated demand.
