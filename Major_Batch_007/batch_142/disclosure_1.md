## Dynamic E-Paper Texture Generation

**Concept:** Extend the grey-scale mapping beyond simple shades to generate the *illusion* of texture on an e-paper display. Instead of just controlling brightness, manipulate the pixel patterns to mimic materials like paper grain, cloth, or even subtle 3D effects.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** E-paper display capable of individual pixel control (required). Processor with sufficient RAM to store and process texture maps.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Texture Map Library:** A collection of pre-defined texture maps represented as small arrays defining pixel pattern offsets or modulation values. Examples: "Linen," "WatercolorPaper," "Canvas," "WoodGrain," "Stone".
    *   **Content Analysis Engine:** Identifies content type within a page (text, image, vector graphic) and applies appropriate texture map selection criteria.
    *   **Pixel Pattern Generator:** Takes a base grey-scale value for a pixel and modifies it based on the selected texture map. This modification doesn't change the *overall* grey-scale level significantly, but it introduces subtle variations.
    *   **Waveform Optimization:** Critically, the system must generate optimized waveforms for the e-paper display to render these textured patterns efficiently.  Standard waveforms will likely result in ghosting or poor contrast.

**Pseudocode (Pixel Pattern Generator):**

```
function generate_textured_pixel(base_grey_value, texture_map):
  texture_width = texture_map.width
  texture_height = texture_map.height
  pixel_x = pixel_x % texture_width
  pixel_y = pixel_y % texture_height

  texture_offset = texture_map[pixel_x, pixel_y] //Small value, +/- 5-10 grey levels
  
  final_grey_value = clamp(base_grey_value + texture_offset, 0, 255)
  
  return final_grey_value
```

**Detailed Implementation:**

1.  **Texture Map Creation:**  Texture maps are small (e.g., 8x8, 16x16) arrays of integer values. Each value represents a small offset to be added to the base grey-scale level of a pixel. These values are carefully chosen to create the desired visual texture. Values should be relatively small to maintain readability and contrast.

2.  **Content Analysis:**  The system analyzes the content on each page to determine the appropriate texture map. For example:
    *   Text pages: Subtle "paper" texture.
    *   Images:  Texture can be applied based on the image content (e.g., "canvas" for paintings, "linen" for portraits).
    *   Vector graphics:  Potential for more complex texture mapping based on the shapes and colors.

3.  **Pixel Rendering:**  For each pixel on the page, the following steps are performed:
    *   Determine the base grey-scale value.
    *   Select the appropriate texture map based on the content analysis.
    *   Calculate the pixel's x and y coordinates within the texture map.
    *   Retrieve the texture offset from the texture map.
    *   Add the texture offset to the base grey-scale value.
    *   Clamp the result to the valid grey-scale range.
    *   Generate a custom waveform for the e-paper display to render the pixel with the modified grey-scale value.

4.  **Waveform Optimization:**  This is critical. Standard e-paper waveforms are optimized for solid grey-scale values. Textured patterns require waveforms that can accurately render subtle variations in grey-scale. This might involve:
    *   Using shorter pulse widths.
    *   Adjusting the voltage levels.
    *   Implementing a custom waveform generator.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Dynamic Texture Adjustment:**  Adjust the texture based on the viewing angle or ambient lighting.
*   **User-Customizable Textures:** Allow users to create and upload their own textures.
*   **Procedural Texture Generation:**  Generate textures algorithmically instead of relying on pre-defined maps.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:** Combine the visual texture with haptic feedback to create a more immersive experience.
