## Dynamic Haptic Feedback via Electrophoretic Manipulation

**Concept:** Extend the electrophoretic display technology to provide localized haptic feedback by dynamically altering the physical texture of the display surface. Instead of *just* changing color/grayscale, we'll manipulate the particle arrangement to create subtle bumps, ridges, or depressions under the user's finger.

**Specs:**

*   **Particle Variety:** Utilize a mix of electrophoretic particles with differing sizes and magnetic properties. Standard color-changing particles plus micro-magnetic spheres capable of being individually addressed.
*   **Electrode Matrix:** Implement a high-resolution electrode matrix *beneath* the electrophoretic layer. Each electrode controls a small area (e.g., 1mm x 1mm). Crucially, these electrodes aren't just for color change; they control the *height* of the particle layer.
*   **Magnetic Field Layer:** Integrate a layer capable of generating localized magnetic fields *above* the electrode matrix. This can be achieved using micro-coils or a grid of individually addressable electromagnets.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated controller manages the voltages applied to the electrodes, the currents in the electromagnets, and the overall display refresh rate.
*   **Firmware & API:** Provide a software API allowing developers to define "texture maps" - essentially grayscale images where pixel brightness corresponds to the desired height of the surface at that location. The API would handle converting these maps into the necessary electrode and magnetic field control signals.
*   **Material Composition:** The encapsulated particles must be robust enough to withstand repeated deformation and movement without cracking or leaking. A polymer shell with high elasticity is essential.
*   **Display Stack:**
    1.  Protective Outer Layer
    2.  Transparent Electrode Layer (ITO or similar)
    3.  Electrophoretic Particle Layer (mixed sizes & magnetic)
    4.  Magnetic Field Generation Layer (micro-coils or electromagnets)
    5.  High-Resolution Electrode Matrix
    6.  Backplane (containing drivers and control logic)

**Pseudocode:**

```
function create_haptic_effect(texture_map, duration):
  // texture_map is a 2D array representing desired surface height (0-255)
  // duration is the length of the effect in milliseconds

  for each pixel(x, y) in texture_map:
    height = texture_map[x, y]
    voltage = map(height, 0, 255, min_voltage, max_voltage) //Map height to voltage
    magnetic_field_strength = calculate_magnetic_field(height) //Determine field needed
    set_electrode(x, y, voltage)
    set_magnetic_field(x, y, magnetic_field_strength)

  wait(duration)

  //Return surface to flat state
  for each pixel(x, y):
    set_electrode(x, y, zero_voltage)
    set_magnetic_field(x, y, zero_field)
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Button Feedback:** Create a tactile "click" sensation when a virtual button is pressed.
*   **Texture Simulation:** Simulate the feel of different materials (wood grain, fabric, etc.).
*   **Accessibility:** Provide haptic cues for visually impaired users.
*   **Gaming:** Enhance immersion by providing tactile feedback for in-game events.
*   **Braille Display:** Enable a dynamically updated Braille display.
