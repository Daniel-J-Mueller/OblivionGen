## Predictive Partitioning & Dynamic Metric Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the existing partitioned metric storage system with predictive capabilities to anticipate storage needs *and* dynamically adjust metric granularity based on predicted resource utilization, reducing storage overhead and improving query performance.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive Partitioning Module:**

*   **Input:** Time-series data of incoming metric measurements, historical metric data, auto-scaling group configuration (desired capacity, minimum/maximum instances), load balancer metrics (requests per second, latency).
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to predict future metric volume for each logical partition.  The model ingests historical data, auto-scaling group configuration, and load balancer metrics.
    *   Calculate predicted storage requirements for each partition over a configurable time window (e.g., 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours).
    *   Dynamically adjust partition size or number of replicas based on predicted storage needs. If a partition is predicted to exceed capacity, automatically split it or increase replication *before* it becomes overloaded.
    *   Utilize a cost function that balances storage costs, query performance, and operational overhead.
*   **Output:** Adjusted partition configuration (size, number of replicas) for each logical partition.

**2. Dynamic Metric Granularity Module:**

*   **Input:** Predicted resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) for each virtual machine instance in the auto-scale group, the current metric granularity setting, a configurable sensitivity threshold.
*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor resource utilization and compare it to a configurable sensitivity threshold.
    *   If utilization is consistently low (below the threshold) for a given instance, dynamically reduce the granularity of the metrics being collected for that instance. For example, reduce the sampling rate, or aggregate metrics over longer intervals.
    *   If utilization is consistently high, dynamically increase the granularity of the metrics being collected.
    *   Employ a feedback loop that monitors the impact of granularity changes on auto-scaling decisions and adjusts the sensitivity threshold accordingly.
    *   Implement a mechanism to prevent "thrashing" – rapid oscillations between high and low granularity settings.
*   **Output:** Adjusted metric granularity settings for each virtual machine instance.

**3. Data Serialization Enhancement:**

*   Extend the existing binary serialization format to include a "granularity level" field for each measurement. This field indicates the sampling rate or aggregation interval used when collecting the measurement.
*   Include a “prediction confidence” field in the serialization to indicate the confidence level of the predictive partitioning module.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Granularity Adjustment):**

```
function adjust_granularity(instance_id, current_granularity, utilization, threshold):
    if utilization < threshold:
        new_granularity = current_granularity * 2  // Reduce sampling rate
        if new_granularity > MAX_GRANULARITY:
            new_granularity = MAX_GRANULARITY
    else:
        new_granularity = current_granularity / 2 // Increase sampling rate
        if new_granularity < MIN_GRANULARITY:
            new_granularity = MIN_GRANULARITY
    
    return new_granularity
```

**System Integration:**

*   Integrate the Predictive Partitioning Module and Dynamic Metric Granularity Module into the existing metric collection pipeline.
*   Expose configuration options for setting sensitivity thresholds, time windows, and granularity levels.
*   Implement monitoring and alerting to track the performance of the predictive and dynamic adjustment mechanisms.
