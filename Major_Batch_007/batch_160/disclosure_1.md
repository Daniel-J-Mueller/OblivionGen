## Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Predictive Steering

**Concept:** Expand the multi-device arbitration beyond simple selection to create dynamically adjustable acoustic zones within a space. This goes beyond just *who* responds, to *where* the response originates, optimizing for both clarity and user experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Each voice-enabled device (VECD) will be equipped with an array of microphones *and* directional speakers. Minimum of 4 microphones per VECD, and a speaker capable of beamforming/directional audio output.
*   **Software - Zone Mapping Module:**
    *   **Spatial Audio Analysis:** Continuous real-time analysis of the acoustic environment utilizing microphone arrays on each VECD. This includes:
        *   Sound source localization (identifying where sounds originate from).
        *   Reverberation mapping (understanding the acoustic properties of the space).
        *   Noise floor analysis (determining ambient noise levels).
    *   **Occupancy Detection:** Integration with existing or new sensor data (e.g., cameras, motion sensors) to identify the location of users within the space.
    *   **Zone Creation:** Automatic or user-defined creation of acoustic zones. Zones are defined by spatial coordinates and represent areas where a targeted audio response should be prioritized. Example: "Living Room", "Kitchen", "Bedroom".  Zones can be overlapping or nested.
*   **Software - Predictive Steering Module:**
    *   **User History:** Track user location patterns. If a user is consistently in the "Kitchen" during specific times, the system anticipates their location.
    *   **Command Analysis:**  Analyze the *content* of the speech command.  Example: "Play music" implies a desire for broader audio distribution, while "Set a timer for 5 minutes" might be better suited to a localized response from the nearest VECD.
    *   **Arbitration Algorithm:** Modified arbitration process.
        1.  Wake word detected.
        2.  Identify all VECDs detecting the wake word and their respective audio qualities.
        3.  Determine the *most likely* user location based on user history, sensor data, and command analysis.
        4.  Select the VECD best positioned to serve the identified user location *and* fulfill the command.  This isn't just about signal strength, but about directional audio capability.
        5.  Initiate directional audio output from the selected VECD, focusing the response towards the predicted user location.
*   **Pseudocode (Arbitration Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION arbitrate_response(wake_word_data, speech_input):
  devices = get_devices_detecting_wake_word(wake_word_data)
  user_location = predict_user_location() // Utilizes history + sensors
  command_type = analyze_command(speech_input)

  best_device = NULL
  best_score = -1

  FOR EACH device IN devices:
    score = calculate_device_score(device, user_location, command_type)
    IF score > best_score:
      best_score = score
      best_device = device

  IF best_device != NULL:
    best_device.play_directional_response(speech_input)
  ELSE:
    //Fallback - broadcast to all devices
    broadcast_response(speech_input)
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculate_device_score(device, user_location, command_type):
  score = 0
  score += device.signal_strength * 0.4
  score += distance_to_user(device.location, user_location) * 0.3 // Negative score
  score += device.directional_audio_capability * 0.2
  score += command_compatibility(command_type, device.capabilities) * 0.1
  RETURN score
END FUNCTION
```

*   **Future Expansion:** Integration with spatial audio rendering to create immersive soundscapes, personalized to each user within the space.
