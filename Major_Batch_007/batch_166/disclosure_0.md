## Dynamic Device Persona Generation & Predictive Querying

**Concept:** Extend the search index to not just *store* device attributes, but to dynamically construct "device personas" and *predict* likely user queries *before* they are made. This shifts the system from reactive search to proactive information delivery.

**Specs:**

**1. Persona Construction Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw device information (as per the patent), user interaction data (app usage, feature engagement, time of day, location if permitted), and a configurable ‘persona depth’ parameter (determines complexity – e.g., basic = ‘mobile gamer’, advanced = ‘productivity focused professional frequently traveling’).
*   **Process:** Employ a weighted scoring system based on device attributes and user interaction data.  Attributes and interactions are categorized (e.g., processing power, screen size, app categories, typical usage times). Weights are adjustable via a management interface.  The scoring system outputs a persona profile (a vector of persona attributes, e.g. [gamer:0.8, professional:0.2, social_media:0.6]).
*   **Output:** A dynamic "persona profile" associated with each customer ID.  This profile is updated continuously based on incoming data.

**2. Predictive Query Engine:**

*   **Input:** Persona profile, historical query data (anonymized and aggregated), trending search terms, and a ‘prediction horizon’ parameter (how far ahead to predict – e.g., 1 hour, 1 day).
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) trained on historical query data. The model maps persona profiles to likely search queries.
    *   Employ collaborative filtering – identify customers with similar personas and predict queries based on their recent search history.
    *   Consider external factors (e.g., time of day, location, trending news) to refine predictions.
*   **Output:** A prioritized list of predicted queries for each customer, ranked by probability.

**3.  Proactive Information Delivery System:**

*   **Input:** Predicted queries, search index.
*   **Process:** Pre-fetch search results for top predicted queries and cache them for rapid delivery.
*   **Output:**
    *   **Proactive Notifications:** Display relevant information to the user before they initiate a search (e.g., "Traffic is heavy on your commute route," "New features available in your favorite app").
    *   **Personalized App Suggestions:** Recommend apps based on predicted needs.
    *   **Adaptive UI:** Adjust the user interface to prioritize frequently accessed features based on predicted tasks.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Persona Construction Module:**  Runs as a microservice, consuming device information and user interaction data from data streams (e.g., Kafka).
*   **Predictive Query Engine:**  Runs as a separate microservice, periodically retraining the machine learning model and generating predicted queries.
*   **Proactive Information Delivery System:** Integrated into the customer-facing application (mobile app, web portal) to deliver proactive notifications and personalized experiences.
*   **Data Store:** A distributed database (e.g., Cassandra) to store persona profiles and predicted queries.
*   **API:** A RESTful API to expose the system's functionality to other applications.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Query Engine):**

```
function predictQueries(personaProfile, historicalData, trendingTerms, predictionHorizon):
  // Load trained machine learning model
  model = loadModel()

  // Generate initial predictions using the model
  predictedQueries = model.predict(personaProfile)

  // Refine predictions using collaborative filtering
  similarUsers = findSimilarUsers(personaProfile, historicalData)
  for user in similarUsers:
    addRecentQueries(predictedQueries, user.recentQueries)

  // Incorporate trending terms
  addTrendingTerms(predictedQueries, trendingTerms)

  // Sort queries by probability
  sortedQueries = sortQueriesByProbability(predictedQueries)

  return sortedQueries
```
