## Dynamic Content Stitching with Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Extend the temporal overlap handling to *predictively* buffer content based on anticipated playback scenarios. Instead of reacting to overlaps, proactively prepare for them.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** "Scenario Buffer." A multi-tiered buffer system designed to hold fragments of both live and advertising content *before* the actual transition point.
*   **Predictive Engine:** AI-driven module analyzes manifest data (duration, type, content provider) and historical user behavior to predict the likelihood of each playback scenario (playing both fragments, dropping one). It assigns a 'confidence score' to each scenario.
*   **Buffer Allocation:**  The Predictive Engine dynamically allocates buffer space to each likely scenario based on its confidence score.  Higher confidence = more space allocated.
*   **Prefetching:** Fragments for the most likely scenarios are prefetched *before* the transition.  This minimizes latency and ensures seamless switching.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously monitor actual playback behavior and adjust buffer allocation/prefetching in real-time.
*   **Buffering Tiers:**
    *   **Tier 1 (Critical):** Fragments for the *most likely* scenario – guaranteed prefetch & immediate availability.
    *   **Tier 2 (Probable):** Fragments for scenarios with moderate confidence. Prefetched but may require a short loading time.
    *   **Tier 3 (Contingency):** Fragments for less likely scenarios – available on demand.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
ScenarioBuffer = new ScenarioBuffer()
PredictiveEngine = new PredictiveEngine()

// Main Loop (runs continuously)
function processManifest(manifestData) {
  predictedScenarios = PredictiveEngine.predictScenarios(manifestData)

  // Allocate buffer space based on prediction confidence
  for (scenario in predictedScenarios) {
    ScenarioBuffer.allocateSpace(scenario, predictedScenarios[scenario].confidence)
    // Prefetch fragments for the scenario
    ScenarioBuffer.prefetchFragments(scenario, manifestData)
  }
}

function handlePlaybackTransition(transitionData) {
  // Check which scenario actually occurred
  actualScenario = determineActualScenario(transitionData)

  // Retrieve fragments from the ScenarioBuffer (should be readily available)
  fragments = ScenarioBuffer.retrieveFragments(actualScenario)

  // Play fragments
  playFragments(fragments)

  // Adjust Predictive Engine based on actual scenario (learning)
  PredictiveEngine.learn(actualScenario, transitionData)
}

// Function to determine the actual scenario.
function determineActualScenario(transitionData) {
    // Analyze the playback data to determine if the live event fragment or the advertisement fragment was actually played.
    // Consider timing, content type, and other relevant factors.
    // Return the identified scenario.
}
```

**Novelty:**

Traditional overlap handling is reactive. This system *proactively* prepares for multiple scenarios, minimizing latency and improving the user experience. It introduces a layer of AI-driven prediction and dynamic resource allocation to streaming media, moving beyond simple buffering. The tiered buffer system provides a flexible and efficient way to manage resources.
