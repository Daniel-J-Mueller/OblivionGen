## Adaptive Haptic Projection System

**Core Concept:** Expand the depth mapping and projection system to *actively* create localized haptic feedback by modulating the projected light’s thermal properties. Instead of *just* seeing a projected interface, the user feels temperature variations corresponding to interface elements, creating a more immersive and intuitive experience.

**System Specs:**

*   **Projector Modification:** Standard RGB projector augmented with an array of micro-heaters positioned directly in front of the projection lenses. Each micro-heater is individually addressable.
*   **Depth Sensor Integration:** Existing depth sensor (ToF preferred) provides real-time depth data *and* surface material estimation (rough approximation via reflected light intensity/wavelength).
*   **Thermal Map Generation:**
    *   Based on the projected image and depth map, a corresponding "thermal map" is generated. High-intensity pixels or interface elements are assigned higher thermal values.
    *   Material estimation influences thermal map generation.  Materials known to quickly absorb/radiate heat receive higher initial thermal values.
    *   User-defined "thermal profiles" can be applied to customize the haptic experience.
*   **Micro-Heater Control:**  Each micro-heater’s output is individually controlled based on the corresponding thermal map value and the distance to the detected surface (from depth map). This allows for dynamic temperature modulation.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  A secondary IR sensor array, integrated into the image sensor, detects the surface temperature. This data is fed back into the system, allowing for real-time calibration and stabilization of the thermal projection.
*   **Safety Mechanisms:**  Temperature limits are strictly enforced. The system continuously monitors surface temperatures and automatically reduces or stops heating if thresholds are exceeded.

**Pseudocode (Thermal Map Generation & Heater Control):**

```
// Input: Projected Image (imageArray), Depth Map (depthArray), Surface Material Estimation (materialArray)
// Output: Micro-Heater Control Signals (heaterSignals)

function generateThermalMap(imageArray, depthArray, materialArray):
  thermalMap = new array(width, height)

  for i from 0 to width - 1:
    for j from 0 to height - 1:
      // Base thermal value based on image intensity
      thermalValue = imageArray[i][j].intensity * scalingFactor

      // Adjust based on depth (closer = higher value)
      distance = depthArray[i][j]
      if distance > maxDepth:
        distance = maxDepth  // Cap distance to prevent extreme values
      thermalValue += (1 - (distance / maxDepth)) * depthScalingFactor

      //Adjust based on material
      materialCoefficient = materialArray[i][j] // between 0 and 1.
      thermalValue += materialCoefficient * materialScalingFactor

      thermalMap[i][j] = thermalValue

  return thermalMap

function controlHeaters(thermalMap):
  heaterSignals = new array(numHeaters)

  for i from 0 to numHeaters - 1:
    // Map thermal map value to heater output (0-maxOutput)
    heaterSignals[i] = map(thermalMap[heaterIndex[i]], 0, maxThermalValue, 0, maxOutput)

  return heaterSignals
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Interactive holographic displays with tactile feedback.
*   Enhanced gaming experiences.
*   Medical training simulations (surgical tools with temperature sensations).
*   Accessibility tools for visually impaired users.
*   Remote manipulation with haptic feedback.
