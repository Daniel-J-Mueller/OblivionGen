## Adaptive Network 'Shadowing' for Proactive User Experience Management

**Concept:** Extend the adverse event detection and notification system to proactively 'shadow' user network sessions, creating a synthetic, parallel data stream to predict and mitigate impacts *before* the user experiences degradation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow Session Creation Module:**

*   **Trigger:** Initiated upon detection of a potential adverse network event (as per the original patent) *and* based on a user-defined 'sensitivity' level (e.g., high, medium, low - affecting how aggressively shadowing is initiated).
*   **Process:** For selected users (based on sensitivity and event type), create a parallel network session – a ‘shadow’ – mimicking the user’s traffic. This is done by intercepting initial connection requests (TCP SYN, UDP association) and replicating them to a dedicated ‘shadow’ infrastructure.
*   **Infrastructure:**  Shadow infrastructure consists of virtual network devices (routers, switches, firewalls) mirroring the production network topology, but isolated from live user traffic.
*   **Traffic Replication:** Replicate initial packets (SYN, UDP) to the shadow network. Subsequent traffic is generated *synthetically* based on observed patterns in the user’s initial connection and application-level handshake data (e.g., HTTP GET requests, DNS queries).  Use a Markov model, trained on historical user traffic data, to predict subsequent packet sequences.
*   **Data Collection:**  Collect performance metrics (latency, packet loss, jitter) from both the live user session *and* the shadow session.

**2. Predictive Impact Analysis Module:**

*   **Differential Analysis:** Continuously compare performance metrics between the live session and the shadow session. A significant divergence indicates an impact from the adverse event *before* it's fully manifested for the user.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Employ statistical anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Z-score, moving average) on the differential data to identify subtle performance degradations.
*   **Impact Prediction:**  Based on the degree of divergence and the type of adverse event, predict the potential impact on the user’s experience (e.g., increased latency, dropped calls, stalled video streams).

**3. Proactive Mitigation Module:**

*   **Dynamic Path Adjustment:** If a negative impact is predicted, dynamically adjust the user’s network path *before* the impact is felt. This can involve:
    *   **Traffic Redirection:**  Redirecting traffic to an alternative path that bypasses the affected network area.
    *   **QoS Prioritization:** Increasing the Quality of Service (QoS) priority for the user’s traffic.
    *   **Adaptive Bitrate Adjustment:** Adjusting the bitrate of streaming media to compensate for reduced bandwidth.
*   **Preemptive Caching:**  Preemptively cache frequently accessed content closer to the user to reduce latency.
*   **User Notification (Optional):**  Notify the user about the potential impact and the proactive measures taken.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Event Loop
while (true) {
  event = detectAdverseNetworkEvent()
  if (event != null) {
    userList = getUsersMatchingEvent(event)
    for (user in userList) {
      if (user.sensitivity > threshold) {
        createShadowSession(user)
        shadowData = collectShadowData(user)
        liveData = collectLiveData(user)
        impact = analyzeImpact(liveData, shadowData)
        if (impact > threshold) {
          mitigateImpact(user)
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

function mitigateImpact(user) {
  //Implement path adjustment, QoS prioritization, or caching
}

function analyzeImpact(liveData, shadowData) {
  //Compare latency, packet loss, jitter.
  //Return impact score.
}
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Dedicated server infrastructure for shadow network.
*   High-performance packet processing engine.
*   Machine learning models for traffic prediction and anomaly detection.
*   Integration with existing network management systems.
*   Scalability to support a large number of concurrent users.
