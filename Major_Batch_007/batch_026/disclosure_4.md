## Adaptive Credential Rotation with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of managing multiple credentials to include dynamic, behaviorally-informed rotation of those credentials, enhancing security beyond static key management.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component Integration:** Integrate with existing authentication systems (like Kerberos) and add a Behavioral Biometrics Engine (BBE). The BBE analyzes user interactions (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scrolling speed, touch pressure, etc.) to create a behavioral profile.
*   **Credential Pool:** Maintain a pool of credentials (TGTs, passwords, API keys, etc.) associated with a user, similar to the patent, but managed dynamically.
*   **Risk Scoring:**  The BBE continuously monitors user behavior and assigns a risk score. This score is a weighted combination of various behavioral metrics. 
*   **Adaptive Rotation Trigger:** Define thresholds for the risk score. When the score exceeds a threshold, trigger credential rotation *before* a potential compromise is detected.  Rotation is prioritized for components with higher sensitivity.
*   **Rotation Mechanism:** When rotation is triggered:
    1.  Generate new credentials for the affected component(s).
    2.  Seamlessly update the client-side credential cache (leveraging existing Kerberos ticket renewal mechanisms where applicable).  For non-Kerberos components, employ a secure channel for credential delivery.
    3.  Revoke the old credentials.
*   **User Profiling & Baseline:** The system needs an initial learning phase to establish a baseline behavioral profile for each user. This profile is continuously updated to account for natural variations.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  The BBE uses statistical analysis and machine learning to detect anomalies in user behavior. Significant deviations from the baseline profile contribute to the risk score.
*   **Component Sensitivity Mapping:**  Administrators can assign sensitivity levels to different components/applications.  Higher sensitivity components trigger more frequent credential rotation or stricter anomaly detection.
*   **Pseudocode (Rotation Trigger):**

```
FUNCTION TriggerCredentialRotation(user, component, riskScore, sensitivityLevel):
  IF riskScore > GetThreshold(sensitivityLevel) OR
     HasSignificantAnomaly(user, component):
    GenerateNewCredential(component)
    UpdateClientCache(user, component, newCredential)
    RevokeOldCredential(component)
    LogRotationEvent(user, component)
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:**  Standard server infrastructure, BBE processing power (GPU acceleration recommended for real-time analysis).
*   **Software Requirements:**  Integration with existing authentication frameworks, machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch), secure communication protocols.
*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   **Predictive Rotation:**  Use machine learning to predict potential compromise based on historical data and external threat intelligence.
    *   **Geolocation Integration:** Factor in user location as part of the risk assessment.
    *   **Device Fingerprinting:** Identify and authenticate user devices.
