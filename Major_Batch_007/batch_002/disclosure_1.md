## Dynamic Creator "Trust Networks" & Content Provenance

**Specification:** A system extending the core verification process to create dynamically adjusting "trust networks" for content creators, and a robust content provenance system leveraging blockchain-inspired immutability.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of solely relying on designated third-party verifiers (publishers, studios), the system allows *verified* creators to vouch for *other* creators, building a web of trust.  This introduces a layer of community-driven verification alongside institutional verification. Furthermore, all content submissions, verifications, and "trust votes" are immutably logged for provenance tracking.

**System Components:**

1.  **Trust Score Calculation:** Each creator has a "Trust Score" derived from:
    *   Initial Verification (via publisher/studio – weight: 60%)
    *   "Trust Votes" from other Verified Creators (weight: 40% – decaying over time to prevent gaming).  A creator can "vouch" for another, assigning a trust level (Low/Medium/High).
    *   Content Dispute Resolution (negative impact on Trust Score if content is flagged & successfully disputed).

2.  **"Vouching" Interface:**  Verified creators access an interface to "vouch" for other creators. This requires a brief explanation of *why* they are vouching for the individual (e.g., "Worked with them on Project X, highly professional"). This explanation is also immutably logged.

3.  **Immutability Layer (Inspired by Blockchain):**  All key actions (Verification, Vouching, Content Submission, Dispute Resolution) are recorded as "transactions" in a distributed, append-only log. This isn’t necessarily a full blockchain implementation, but mimics its core properties.  (Consider a Merkle tree structure for efficient data verification.)

4.  **Content Provenance Tracking:** Every piece of submitted content is linked to the creator’s identity *and* the chain of verifications that validate their authorship. This creates a "digital lineage" for the content.

5.  **Dynamic Visibility Control:**  Content visibility can be tiered based on Trust Score. Higher scores grant wider distribution, while lower scores may result in content being flagged or require manual review.

**Pseudocode (Trust Score Update):**

```
function updateTrustScore(creatorID):
  initialVerificationWeight = 0.6
  trustVoteWeight = 0.4

  // Fetch data
  initialVerificationScore = getInitialVerificationScore(creatorID)
  trustVotes = getTrustVotes(creatorID)
  disputeCount = getDisputeCount(creatorID)

  // Calculate trust vote component
  totalTrustVoteValue = 0
  for each vote in trustVotes:
    voterTrustScore = getTrustScore(voterID) //recursive
    voteValue = voterTrustScore * vote.strength //strength: Low=0.25, Medium=0.5, High=0.75
    totalTrustVoteValue += voteValue

  trustVoteComponent = totalTrustVoteValue / count(trustVotes)

  // Dispute penalty
  disputePenalty = disputeCount * 0.1 //adjust as needed

  // Calculate final trust score
  trustScore = (initialVerificationWeight * initialVerificationScore) + (trustVoteWeight * trustVoteComponent) - disputePenalty

  // Ensure score stays within bounds (0-1)
  trustScore = clamp(trustScore, 0, 1)

  // Store updated trust score
  storeTrustScore(creatorID, trustScore)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Combating Misinformation:**  Clear provenance and trust scores help users assess the credibility of content.
*   **Supporting Independent Creators:** Allows creators without traditional institutional backing to build trust through community vouching.
*   **Enhanced Content Licensing:** Immutable provenance simplifies rights management and licensing.
*   **NFT Integration:**  Provides a robust verification layer for NFTs, ensuring authenticity and provenance.
