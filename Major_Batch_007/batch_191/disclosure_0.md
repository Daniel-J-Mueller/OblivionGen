## Adaptive Ambient Lighting System – ‘Aura’

**Concept:** Extend the coordinated lighting control beyond simple on/off/dimming to create a fully adaptive ambient lighting experience responsive to environmental conditions *and* user biometrics.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** ‘Aura’ Node – A standalone unit, functionally similar to the ‘first power device’ in the patent, but with extended sensor capabilities and processing power.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   Ambient Light Sensor (wide spectrum).
    *   Sound Level Sensor (dB range: 30-120dB).
    *   Temperature/Humidity Sensor.
    *   Passive Infrared (PIR) Motion Sensor.
    *   Optional: Low-resolution camera for basic object/people detection (privacy-focused processing – see ‘Processing & AI’ below).
    *   Optional: Bio-sensor array (integrated into a compatible wearable – e.g., smart watch/band) measuring heart rate variability (HRV) and skin conductance. This requires a secure, low-latency communication channel.
*   **Light Source Control:**  Supports multiple light sources – standard bulbs (AC/DC), LED strips, and networked ‘smart’ lights (Zigbee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth).
*   **Communication:** Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Mesh, Zigbee/Z-Wave (for compatibility with existing smart home ecosystems).
*   **Power:**  Standard AC power input, optional battery backup.

**Processing & AI:**

*   **Local Processing:** The Aura Node performs initial sensor data processing and runs a lightweight AI model for basic environmental response (e.g., brighten lights during low ambient light, adjust color temperature based on temperature).
*   **Biometric Integration (Optional):** If biometric data is available, the AI model analyzes HRV and skin conductance to infer user stress levels, mood, and alertness.
*   **Adaptive Lighting Profiles:** Based on sensor data and biometric analysis, the AI dynamically adjusts:
    *   **Brightness:** Adjusts to maintain consistent illumination levels, compensating for ambient light changes.
    *   **Color Temperature:** Warmer tones for relaxation, cooler tones for alertness.
    *   **Light Patterns:** Gentle, rhythmic patterns for calming effects (inspired by bioluminescence).
    *   **Directional Lighting:** Focuses light on areas of activity, enhancing visibility and reducing eye strain.
*   **Privacy Focus:** All image processing is performed locally on the Aura Node.  Raw image data is *never* stored or transmitted.  Object detection is limited to basic shapes and movement.
*   **Learning Algorithm:** The system learns user preferences over time, adapting its lighting profiles based on user feedback (explicit – e.g., manual adjustments – and implicit – e.g., observed behavior).

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
loop:
  read_sensor_data()
  biometric_data = receive_biometric_data()  //Optional
  environmental_state = analyze_sensor_data()
  user_state = analyze_biometric_data(biometric_data) //Optional
  lighting_profile = generate_lighting_profile(environmental_state, user_state)
  apply_lighting_profile()
  delay(100ms)
endloop

function generate_lighting_profile(environmental_state, user_state):
  //Default Lighting Profile
  profile = DEFAULT_PROFILE

  //Environmental Adjustments
  if environmental_state.ambient_light < threshold:
    profile.brightness = increase(profile.brightness, amount)
  if environmental_state.sound_level > threshold:
    profile.color_temperature = cool(profile.color_temperature)

  //User State Adjustments (If available)
  if user_state.stress_level > threshold:
    profile.brightness = decrease(profile.brightness, amount)
    profile.color_temperature = warm(profile.color_temperature)
  if user_state.alertness < threshold:
    profile.color_temperature = cool(profile.color_temperature)

  return profile
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simple coordinated lighting control to create a truly *adaptive* ambient lighting experience that responds to both the environment *and* the user’s physiological state.  The integration of biometric data (optional) allows for personalized lighting profiles that promote well-being, reduce stress, and enhance alertness. The local processing and privacy focus address growing concerns about data security and privacy.
