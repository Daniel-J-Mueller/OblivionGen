## Adaptive Address Scrambling with Dynamic Seed Derivation

**Concept:** Expand on the address scrambling idea by making the random seed *not* static, but dynamically derived from environmental factors and/or operational state of the compute node itself. This increases security by reducing predictability and adds a layer of tamper-resistance.

**Specs:**

*   **Seed Generation Module:**
    *   Input Sources:
        *   Real-Time Clock (RTC) – Millisecond precision.
        *   Temperature Sensor – On-chip temperature reading.
        *   Voltage Sensor – On-chip voltage reading.
        *   Processor Load – Current CPU/GPU utilization percentage.
        *   Network Activity – Timestamp of last network packet received/sent.
    *   Algorithm:
        1.  Combine raw sensor readings and timestamps into a single data stream.
        2.  Apply a cryptographic hash function (SHA-256 or similar) to this data stream.
        3.  Use the output of the hash function as the random seed for the address scrambling function.
        4.  Periodically re-generate the seed (e.g., every 10 milliseconds) to adapt to changing environmental conditions.
*   **Scrambling Function:** Remains a one-to-one mapping, but now utilizes the dynamically generated seed.
*   **Seed Storage/Distribution:** Seed is *not* stored persistently. It is generated on-demand and used immediately. A secure, ephemeral key exchange protocol (e.g., Diffie-Hellman) can be used to establish a shared seed between the compute node and the device before data transmission.
*   **Tamper Detection:** Monitor the input sources to the Seed Generation Module. Significant deviations from expected values indicate potential tampering. Trigger a security alert or system shutdown.
*   **Integration:** This module integrates directly with the existing encryption/scrambling logic within the integrated circuit.

**Pseudocode (Seed Generation):**

```
function generate_seed():
    rtc_time = get_rtc_timestamp()
    temp = get_temperature()
    voltage = get_voltage()
    load = get_processor_load()

    data_stream = string(rtc_time) + string(temp) + string(voltage) + string(load)

    seed = SHA256(data_stream) //Cryptographic hash function

    return seed
```

**Innovation Detail:**

This allows for a highly adaptable security system. A static seed is vulnerable to reverse engineering. This system changes the seed constantly, making it significantly harder to predict and compromise. The reliance on multiple environmental factors makes it much more difficult to spoof the seed generation process. It adds a layer of resilience against physical attacks, as tampering with any of the monitored sensors would be immediately detected.
