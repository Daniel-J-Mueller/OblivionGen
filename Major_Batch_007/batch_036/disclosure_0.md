**Dynamic Narrative Stitching for Live Events**

**Concept:** Expand the dynamic content stream generation to not just *select* segments based on event detection and subscription profiles, but to *re-sequence* and *stitch* those segments together to create personalized narrative arcs *within* the live stream. Think beyond simply showing highlights; create different story versions *concurrently*, tailored to the viewer.

**Specs:**

*   **Narrative Engine:** A new software module integrated with the existing video packaging and origination service. It operates on the encoded segments *before* stream formation.
*   **Narrative Templates:** Pre-defined templates dictating potential narrative structures (e.g., "Rivalry Focus," "Underdog Story," "Statistical Breakdown"). Each template outlines a preferred sequence of event types and contextual information.
*   **Event Type Weighting:** Each event type (score, foul, player interaction, audience reaction) receives a weighting within each narrative template. This determines the relative importance of that event in building the chosen story arc.
*   **Contextual Layering:**  Context information (player stats, historical rivalries, expert commentary) is treated as a separate data layer that can be dynamically inserted *between* video segments.
*   **Stitching Algorithm:** An algorithm that selects encoded segments based on:
    *   Event type matching the current narrative template.
    *   Event weighting within the template.
    *   Smooth transitions between segments (based on visual and audio cues).
    *   Dynamic insertion of contextual data.
*   **Real-time Adjustment:** The stitching algorithm must operate in near real-time to accommodate unfolding events.
*   **Subscription Profile Integration:** Subscription profiles determine *which* narrative template is applied to a userâ€™s stream. Premium tiers could offer access to more complex or detailed narratives.
*   **AI-Driven Narrative Adaptation:**  Utilize machine learning to:
    *   Learn viewer preferences for different narrative styles.
    *   Dynamically adjust narrative templates based on unfolding events.
    *   Generate *new* narrative templates based on detected patterns.

**Pseudocode (Stitching Algorithm Core):**

```
FUNCTION StitchStream(encodedSegments[], subscriptionProfile, narrativeTemplate, currentEvent)

    // Filter segments based on event type matching the template
    filteredSegments = FILTER(encodedSegments, WHERE eventType MATCHES narrativeTemplate.preferredEvents)

    // Score segments based on event weight and currentEvent context
    scoredSegments = MAP(filteredSegments, FUNCTION(segment)
        score = segment.eventWeight * contextSimilarity(segment.eventData, currentEvent)
        RETURN (segment, score)
    END)

    // Select top N segments (N determined by template/profile)
    selectedSegments = SORT(scoredSegments, BY score DESCENDING)
    selectedSegments = TAKE(selectedSegments, N)

    // Dynamically insert contextual data between segments
    finalStream = INTERLEAVE(selectedSegments, GENERATE_CONTEXTUAL_DATA(selectedSegments, subscriptionProfile))

    RETURN finalStream
END
```

**Possible Applications:**

*   **Sports:**  A viewer subscribing to the "Rivalry Focus" profile would see a stream emphasizing interactions between opposing players, historical clashes, and expert analysis of the rivalry.
*   **Gaming:** A stream highlighting a player's strategic decisions, key moments, and interactions with teammates.
*   **News/Events:** Personalized coverage of a breaking story, focusing on specific angles or perspectives.
