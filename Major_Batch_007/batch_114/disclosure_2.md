## Adaptive Debugging Granularity via Request-Time Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic debugging approach to include request-time performance profiling, enabling *adaptive* debugging granularity based on initial performance characteristics. Instead of a binary ‘debug on/off’ or fixed levels, the system would initially profile a small subset of the request’s execution path and *dynamically* adjust debugging detail based on measured latency and resource usage.

**Specifications:**

**1. Profiling Agent Integration:**

*   Modify service entry points to include a lightweight profiling agent. This agent has minimal overhead in its default state.
*   The agent intercepts the request and immediately begins measuring execution time for a pre-defined “critical path” – the essential steps to fulfill the request.
*   The critical path is configurable per service, allowing prioritization of performance-sensitive operations.
*   Collected metrics include: CPU time, memory allocation, and function call counts within the critical path.
*   A “profiling threshold” is set globally. If the critical path exceeds this threshold, detailed debugging is activated.

**2. Debugging Granularity Control:**

*   Introduce a “debug detail level” parameter, ranging from 0 (no debugging) to N (maximum debugging).
*   The initial detail level is determined by the ‘debug-requested’ field in the original request.
*   If the profiling agent detects performance issues (exceeding the threshold), the debug detail level is *incremented* dynamically. The increment amount is configurable.
*   Conversely, if performance is within acceptable limits, the debug detail level can be *decremented* to reduce overhead.
*   The system records the initial, and dynamically adjusted, debug detail levels for each request.

**3. Context Propagation:**

*   The dynamically adjusted debug detail level, alongside the unique call-id, is propagated to downstream services.
*   Each service honors the received detail level, adjusting its logging and instrumentation accordingly.

**4. Log Aggregation & Analysis:**

*   Logs include the initial debug request, dynamically adjusted detail levels, and key performance metrics from the profiling agent.
*   Analysis tools can correlate performance bottlenecks with debugging granularity, identifying areas where over-debugging introduces significant overhead.

**Pseudocode (Service Entry Point):**

```
function handleRequest(request):
  debugRequested = request.debugRequested
  uniqueCallId = request.uniqueCallId

  // Initialize profiling agent
  profilingAgent = new ProfilingAgent()

  // Start profiling critical path
  profilingAgent.startProfiling(criticalPath)

  // Get initial debug detail level
  debugDetailLevel = determineDebugDetailLevel(debugRequested)

  // If profiling detects issues:
  if (profilingAgent.executionTimeExceedsThreshold()):
    debugDetailLevel = increaseDebugDetailLevel(debugDetailLevel)

  // Propagate debug detail level and uniqueCallId to downstream services
  newRequest = cloneRequest(request)
  newRequest.debugDetailLevel = debugDetailLevel
  newRequest.uniqueCallId = uniqueCallId

  // Process request
  response = processRequest(newRequest)

  // Log performance metrics and debug level
  logRequestDetails(uniqueCallId, debugDetailLevel, profilingAgent.metrics)

  return response
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Profiling agent should be implemented as a lightweight library minimizing impact on service performance.
*   Log aggregation and analysis tools should support filtering and correlation based on debug detail level and unique call-id.
*   The profiling threshold and debug detail level increment/decrement values should be configurable via a central configuration management system.
*   Consider asynchronous logging to minimize impact on request processing time.
