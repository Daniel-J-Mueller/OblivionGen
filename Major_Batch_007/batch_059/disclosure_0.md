## Dynamic Regional Power Allocation & Frequency Scaling

**Concept:** Expand on the temperature-aware frequency scaling by introducing *regional* power allocation and frequency control, tied to workload prediction. Instead of globally reacting to temperature, proactively adjust power and frequency *per region* of the chip based on predicted heat generation from anticipated workloads.

**Specs:**

*   **Regional Breakdown:** Divide the integrated circuit into a grid of thermal regions (e.g., 16x16, configurable). Each region will have dedicated temperature sensors (minimum 2 per region).
*   **Workload Prediction Engine:** A dedicated hardware module (or tightly coupled software) which analyzes running processes and predicts future CPU usage *per core*.  This engine uses historical data, process affinity information, and potentially AI/ML models. Output:  A predicted heat map (heat generation per core, averaged over short time windows - 10ms - 100ms)
*   **Dynamic Voltage/Frequency Domain (DVFD) Controller:** Each thermal region has a DVFD controller allowing independent voltage and frequency scaling.
*   **Power Allocation Manager:** A hardware module responsible for allocating the total power budget amongst the DVFD controllers, guided by the predicted heat map and current temperature readings.
*   **Inter-Regional Power Borrowing:**  Mechanism to temporarily 'borrow' power from cooler regions to boost frequency in hotter regions, within safe thermal limits, and with a power repayment schedule.
*   **Fine-Grained Clock Gating:** Complementary to DVFS, allowing individual cores to be completely clock-gated (powered off) based on workload prediction.
*   **Thermal Modeling:**  Develop a detailed thermal model of the chip, incorporating thermal resistance values for each region and interconnects. This model will be used by the Power Allocation Manager to accurately predict temperature and prevent thermal runaway.

**Pseudocode (Power Allocation Manager):**

```
// Global variables:
totalPowerBudget
thermalModel
predictedHeatMap
currentTemperatureReadings
regionalDVFDControllers

function allocatePower():
  // 1. Calculate Baseline Power Allocation
  for each region:
    baselinePower = predictedHeatMap[region] * thermalModel.powerPerHeatUnit
    regionalDVFDControllers[region].setPowerLimit(baselinePower)

  // 2. Adjust for Current Temperature
  for each region:
    tempDelta = currentTemperatureReadings[region] - targetTemperature
    powerAdjustment = tempDelta * thermalModel.powerPerTempUnit
    regionalDVFDControllers[region].adjustPowerLimit(powerAdjustment)

  // 3. Inter-Regional Power Balancing
  while powerImbalance > threshold:
    borrowingRegion = findCoolestRegionWithSurplusPower()
    receivingRegion = findHottestRegionWithDeficitPower()
    borrowedPower = calculateSafeBorrowedPower(borrowingRegion, receivingRegion)
    transferPower(borrowingRegion, receivingRegion, borrowedPower)
    scheduleRepayment(receivingRegion, borrowingRegion, borrowedPower)

  // 4. Optimize Frequency/Voltage based on Power Limits
  for each region:
    regionalDVFDControllers[region].optimizeFrequencyVoltage(powerLimit)

  return
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Utilize machine learning models to improve workload prediction accuracy and optimize power allocation strategies.
*   **Power Harvesting:** Explore the possibility of integrating energy harvesting technologies (e.g., thermoelectric generators) to supplement the power budget.
*   **Real-Time Monitoring:** Implement a comprehensive real-time monitoring system to track power consumption, temperature, and performance metrics.
*   **Security Hardening:** Protect the power allocation system from malicious attacks that could lead to denial-of-service or thermal exploits.
