## Dynamic Policy Inheritance & Data Sharding

**Concept:** Extend the forced data transformation policy to enable dynamic inheritance of policies *between* logical data containers, coupled with a data sharding mechanism that distributes transformed data across multiple containers based on policy requirements and data sensitivity levels. This creates a hierarchical, self-segregating data storage system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Policy Inheritance Module:**

*   **Function:**  Allows defining parent-child relationships between logical data containers.  A child container inherits policies from its parent, which can then be overridden or extended.
*   **Data Structure:**  Policy objects include a field `parent_container_id`.  When a policy is applied to a container, the system recursively resolves inherited policies from parent containers.
*   **Inheritance Rules:**
    *   Policies are merged, with child-specific policies taking precedence.
    *   Conflict resolution: Define a priority order for policies (e.g., security > compliance > performance).
    *   Policy propagation: Changes to a parent policy automatically propagate to child containers (with optional approval workflow).

**2. Data Sharding Engine:**

*   **Function:**  Distributes data objects across multiple logical data containers based on a sharding key derived from the policy and data content.
*   **Sharding Key Generation:**
    *   Input: Data object content, policy associated with the original logical data container.
    *   Algorithm:  A hash function incorporating policy attributes (e.g., encryption algorithm, retention period, access controls) and data sensitivity labels (user-defined or automatically detected).
    *   Output: Shard ID â€“ indicates the destination logical data container for the data object.
*   **Shard Mapping Table:**  Maintains a mapping between Shard IDs and logical data container IDs.  Allows dynamic rebalancing of shards.
*   **Data Replication:**  Optionally replicate shards across multiple containers for high availability and disaster recovery.

**3.  API Extensions:**

*   `create_container(parent_container_id, policy)`: Creates a new logical data container, inheriting policies from the specified parent.
*   `store_data(data, container_id)`: Stores data in a logical data container. The system automatically determines the destination shard using the policy and data content.
*   `retrieve_data(data_id)`: Retrieves data from the system. The system locates the appropriate shard and retrieves the data.
*   `get_policy(container_id)`:  Returns the effective policy for a given container (including inherited policies).
*   `update_policy(container_id, policy_delta)`: Updates a policy. The system automatically propagates changes to child containers.

**Pseudocode (store_data):**

```
function store_data(data, container_id):
  policy = get_policy(container_id)
  sharding_key = generate_sharding_key(data, policy)
  shard_id = hash(sharding_key) % number_of_containers
  target_container_id = shard_mapping_table[shard_id]
  
  //Encrypt data if required by policy
  if policy.encryption_enabled:
    encrypted_data = encrypt(data, policy.encryption_key)
  else:
    encrypted_data = data

  store(encrypted_data, target_container_id)
  return success
```

**Refinement Considerations:**

*   **Dynamic Policy Adjustment:** Implement a mechanism to dynamically adjust policies based on real-time data sensitivity or security threats.
*   **Automated Data Classification:** Utilize machine learning to automatically classify data and apply appropriate policies.
*   **Compliance Reporting:** Generate reports to demonstrate compliance with data privacy regulations.
*   **Multi-Tenancy Support:** Adapt the system to support multiple tenants with isolated policies and data.
