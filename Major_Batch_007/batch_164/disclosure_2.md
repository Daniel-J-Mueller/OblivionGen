## Adaptive Camouflage Smart Plug

**Concept:** A smart plug with an exterior surface comprised of micro-e-ink displays capable of dynamically changing color and pattern to blend with its surroundings, or display information. 

**Specs:**

*   **Housing Material:** Durable, slightly flexible polymer (TPU recommended) to accommodate the embedded e-ink display.  Housing dimensions approximately 5cm x 5cm x 7cm (adjustable).
*   **Display:**  Full-surface micro-e-ink display. Resolution: 128x128 pixels minimum. Refresh rate: 2-3 seconds. Color palette: Full RGB, or grayscale with color accent options.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   RGB Color Sensor: Detects ambient colors for camouflage. Sampling rate: 5Hz.
    *   Light Sensor: Detects ambient light levels to adjust display brightness.
    *   Proximity Sensor: Detects nearby objects to activate/deactivate camouflage or display information. Range: 10cm.
*   **Microcontroller:** ESP32-S3 or similar.  WiFi & Bluetooth connectivity.  Local processing for camouflage algorithms.
*   **Power:** Standard AC plug input.  Output: 120V/15A (adjustable for regional standards).
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Camouflage Algorithm: Analyzes color sensor data and dynamically adjusts display to match surrounding environment.  Options for color averaging, pattern matching (texture replication), and dynamic blending.
    *   User Interface: Mobile app (iOS and Android) for customization. Options include:
        *   Camouflage Mode: Automatic environment blending.
        *   Information Display Mode: User-defined text, images, or animations. 
        *   Thematic Modes: Pre-defined camouflage patterns (e.g., wood grain, brick, floral) and information displays (e.g., weather, time, energy usage).
        *   API Access: Enable integration with smart home ecosystems.
*   **Power Consumption:** Optimized firmware for low standby power consumption. Target: < 0.5W in standby mode.

**Pseudocode (Camouflage Algorithm):**

```
function camouflage() {
  colorData = readColorSensor(); // Returns RGB values
  brightness = readLightSensor();

  // Adjust display brightness based on ambient light
  displayBrightness = map(brightness, 0, 1000, 0, 100);

  // Average surrounding color
  avgRed = colorData.red / 3;
  avgGreen = colorData.green / 3;
  avgBlue = colorData.blue / 3;
    
  // Apply to display
  setPixelColor(0, 0, avgRed, avgGreen, avgBlue);
  setPixelColor(width-1, height-1, avgRed, avgGreen, avgBlue);
  //Repeat for all pixels... (optimized for speed)
}

loop:
  camouflage()
  delay(100ms)
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   Explore the use of advanced image processing techniques (e.g., edge detection, texture analysis) to improve camouflage accuracy.
*   Investigate the feasibility of using a miniature camera to capture more detailed surrounding information.
*   Consider incorporating haptic feedback to provide users with confirmation of actions or changes in status.
*   Evaluate the use of different display technologies (e.g., OLED, LED) to optimize brightness, contrast, and power consumption.
*   The housing could incorporate a slight texture to further assist with camouflage and visual blending.
