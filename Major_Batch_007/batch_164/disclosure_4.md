## Dynamic Migration Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the server migration template concept to include 'migration personas' - pre-defined configurations not just for *how* to migrate, but *as if* migrated by a specific user or department, automatically adapting configurations based on anticipated usage patterns.

**Specification:**

**1. Persona Definitions:**

*   A new database table/object store to house ‘Migration Personas.’
*   Each Persona defined by:
    *   `PersonaID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `PersonaName`: e.g., "DatabaseAdmin," "WebDev," "DataScientist," "MarketingAnalyst"
    *   `DefaultKernelVersion`: Preferred kernel.
    *   `DefaultDistributionVersion`: Preferred OS distribution.
    *   `DefaultDriverSet`: Pointer to a pre-defined driver set optimized for that persona’s workload.
    *   `ResourceAllocationProfile`: Baseline CPU/Memory/Storage allocation.
    *   `NetworkProfile`: Baseline network settings (bandwidth, security groups).
    *   `PostMigrationScript`: Optional script to run *after* migration to configure software or services specific to the persona.
    *   `MonitoringTags`: Tags applied to the migrated VM for monitoring/billing.
*   API endpoints to create, read, update, and delete Personas.
*   User interface to manage Personas.

**2. Template Integration:**

*   Server Migration Templates modified to include a `PersonaID` field.
*   When a migration is initiated with a Template and a Persona:
    *   The system reads the Persona definition.
    *   It *overwrites* or *appends* configurations in the Template with those from the Persona, prioritizing Persona settings.
    *   If a setting exists in both the Template *and* the Persona, the Persona setting takes precedence.
    *   If a setting exists in the Persona but *not* in the Template, it’s automatically applied.

**3. Dynamic Adaptation:**

*   Introduce a ‘Migration Analyzer’ component.
*   Before migration, the Analyzer scans the source VM.
*   It identifies installed software, common usage patterns (CPU, memory, network I/O).
*   Based on this analysis, it suggests a *best-fit* Persona to the user.  If no good fit is found, it suggests creating a new Persona.
*   The system could also automatically *learn* Persona preferences over time based on user feedback or observed VM behavior.

**4. Implementation Pseudocode:**

```
function MigrateVM(TemplateID, VMID, PersonaID):
  Template = GetTemplate(TemplateID)
  Persona = GetPersona(PersonaID)

  // Merge Persona settings into Template settings, prioritizing Persona
  MergedTemplate = MergeTemplateAndPersona(Template, Persona)

  // Execute Migration workflow based on MergedTemplate
  MigratedVM = ExecuteMigration(MergedVM, VMID)

  return MigratedVM
```

**5. Advanced Features:**

*   **Persona Recommendations:** System analyzes running VMs and recommends appropriate Personas.
*   **Automated Persona Creation:** System automatically creates Personas based on VM characteristics.
*   **Persona Marketplace:** Allow users to share and sell custom Personas.
*   **Multi-Persona Support:** Allow a single VM to be associated with multiple Personas for different use cases.
