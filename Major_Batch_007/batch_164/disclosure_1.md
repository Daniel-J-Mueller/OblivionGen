## Dynamic Feature Weighting via User Gaze Tracking

**Concept:** Enhance combined feature vector generation by dynamically adjusting feature weights based on user gaze tracking during search refinement. The system will interpret where a user is *looking* on a search results page (or within an item preview) as an indication of feature importance, and adjust weights accordingly.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Eye-tracking hardware integrated into the display device (monitor, VR headset, phone screen). Resolution of at least 30Hz.
*   Standard processing unit capable of running the feature vector generation and weighting algorithms concurrently with display rendering.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Gaze Data Acquisition Module:**  Captures and preprocesses gaze data (x, y coordinates, timestamps) from the eye-tracking hardware. Filters noise and compensates for calibration errors.
*   **Region of Interest (ROI) Definition:**  Defines ROIs within the search results display. These could correspond to:
    *   Item thumbnails
    *   Item titles
    *   Price indicators
    *   Specific item attributes (e.g., color, size)
    *   Filtering options
*   **Gaze-Weight Mapping Function:**  A function that maps gaze duration and frequency within each ROI to a weight adjustment value.
    *   `weight_adjustment =  k * (gaze_duration_ROI / total_gaze_duration) + offset`
        *   `k`: Scaling factor determining the maximum weight adjustment.
        *   `offset`: Baseline weight adjustment.
    *   The function should include a decay factor to prevent over-emphasis on initial gaze fixations.
*   **Feature Vector Weight Adjustment Module:** Applies the calculated weight adjustments to the feature vectors generated for the initial query and refinement query. The module should have safeguards to prevent weights from exceeding pre-defined limits (e.g., 0.0 - 1.0).
*   **Combined Feature Vector Generation:** Combines the weighted feature vectors to create the final combined feature vector for refined search.
*   **Machine Learning Integration (Optional):** Use reinforcement learning to optimize the gaze-weight mapping function based on user engagement metrics (click-through rate, conversion rate).

**3. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
define ROI_list = [ROI_1, ROI_2, ..., ROI_n]
define k = 0.5 // Scaling factor for weight adjustment
define offset = 0.1 // Baseline weight adjustment
define initial_query_vector = generate_feature_vector(initial_query)
define refinement_query_vector = generate_feature_vector(refinement_query)

// Main Loop (during refinement search)
while (user is refining search) {
    // 1. Capture gaze data
    gaze_data = capture_gaze_data()

    // 2. Determine gaze fixation durations within each ROI
    for each ROI in ROI_list {
        fixation_duration[ROI] = calculate_fixation_duration(gaze_data, ROI)
    }

    // 3. Calculate weight adjustments for each feature based on gaze data
    for each feature in feature_list { // Assuming features correspond to ROIs
        weight_adjustment[feature] = k * (fixation_duration[feature] / total_fixation_duration) + offset
    }

    // 4. Apply weight adjustments to feature vectors
    weighted_initial_vector = apply_weights(initial_query_vector, weight_adjustments)
    weighted_refinement_vector = apply_weights(refinement_query_vector, weight_adjustments)

    // 5. Generate combined feature vector
    combined_vector = combine_vectors(weighted_initial_vector, weighted_refinement_vector)

    // 6. Execute search based on combined vector
    search_results = execute_search(combined_vector)
    display_results(search_results)
}
```

**4. Considerations:**

*   **Calibration:** Accurate eye-tracking calibration is critical. Implement a robust calibration procedure.
*   **User Fatigue:** Continuous gaze tracking can be fatiguing. Implement mechanisms to minimize eye strain.
*   **Privacy:** Handle gaze data responsibly and ensure user privacy.
*   **Edge Cases:**  Account for situations where the user is not actively looking at the display (e.g., multitasking).
*   **Multi-modality Integration:** Extend the framework to incorporate gaze data with other user input modalities (e.g., voice, gestures).
