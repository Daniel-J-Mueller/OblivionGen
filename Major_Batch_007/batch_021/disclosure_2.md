## Dynamic Data Weaving & Predictive Schema Generation

**Concept:** Leverage historical operation logs (as noted in claim 16) *not* just for inclusion criteria, but to proactively generate *predicted* relational schemas based on anticipated query patterns. This moves beyond representing existing data to *preparing* for future data access needs. The system will dynamically ‘weave’ data from the non-relational sources into a relational structure *before* a query is even made, optimizing for anticipated access.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Schema Engine (PSE)
*   **Input:**
    *   Historical Operation Logs (from non-relational data sources).
    *   Non-Relational Data Source Metadata (schema, data types, etc.).
    *   Real-time Operation Stream (ongoing operations against data sources).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Query Pattern Analysis:** PSE analyzes historical logs to identify frequent query patterns, including:
        *   Frequently accessed attributes.
        *   Common join conditions.
        *   Typical filtering criteria.
        *   Data aggregation patterns.
    2.  **Schema Prediction:** Based on the query patterns, PSE predicts the optimal relational schema to support those queries. This includes:
        *   Table definitions (names, columns, data types).
        *   Primary and foreign key relationships.
        *   Indexes to optimize query performance.
        *   Materialized views for frequently accessed data combinations.
    3.  **Dynamic Weaving:** PSE utilizes a “Data Weaver” component to transform data from non-relational sources into the predicted relational schema. This transformation happens in the background, populating a dedicated in-memory cache.
    4.  **Adaptive Schema Refinement:** PSE continuously monitors real-time operation streams and refines the predicted schema based on new query patterns. The Data Weaver adjusts accordingly, dynamically updating the in-memory cache.
*   **Output:**
    *   Predicted Relational Schema (metadata).
    *   Populated In-Memory Cache (with data transformed into the predicted schema).
*   **Pseudocode (Data Weaver):**

```
function weaveData(nonRelationalData, predictedSchema):
  // Map non-relational data fields to relational schema columns
  relationalData = {}
  for each field in predictedSchema.columns:
    if field.sourceDataField exists in nonRelationalData:
      relationalData[field.name] = nonRelationalData[field.sourceDataField]
    else:
      relationalData[field.name] = field.defaultValue // Or handle missing data

  // Apply any necessary data transformations (e.g., data type conversion, formatting)
  transformedData = applyTransformations(relationalData, predictedSchema)

  return transformedData
```

*   **Cache Management:**
    *   Cache eviction policies based on access frequency and age.
    *   Cache partitioning and replication for scalability and high availability.
*   **API Integration:**
    *   Standard SQL interface for querying the relational schema.
    *   API for managing the predictive schema and cache.

**Novelty:** This design shifts from reacting to queries to proactively preparing for them. It moves beyond simply representing data to *anticipating* data access needs and optimizing for those needs *before* they are expressed. The continuous adaptation based on real-time operation streams provides a self-tuning system that improves performance over time.
