## Adaptive Terrain Modulation - 'Chameleon Wheels'

**Concept:** Implement wheels capable of dynamically altering their effective diameter and tread pattern to optimize traction and maneuverability across diverse terrains. This goes beyond simply reducing drag during turns – it proactively adapts to the *anticipated* terrain.

**Specifications:**

*   **Wheel Construction:** Modular wheel comprised of independently actuating segments. Each segment is roughly 15 degrees of the full wheel circumference.
*   **Segment Actuation:** Each segment is driven by a small, high-torque electric motor and a miniature rack-and-pinion gear system.  This allows for individual radial extension/retraction of each segment, altering the wheel's overall diameter.
*   **Tread Adaptation:** The exterior surface of each segment utilizes a 'smart material' – a polymer composite containing embedded micro-actuators. These actuators can selectively raise or lower small tread elements (think miniature, independent lugs) to create different tread patterns.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrated IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), LIDAR/Radar for short-range terrain mapping, and wheel-force sensors.
*   **Control System:** Real-time terrain analysis and predictive algorithms.
    *   **Input:** Sensor data (terrain mapping, wheel force, IMU data, AGV speed, planned path).
    *   **Processing:** AI-driven model predicts optimal wheel configuration for upcoming terrain.  Example:  Loosely packed dirt -> extended diameter & aggressive lug pattern.  Smooth concrete -> retracted diameter & minimal lug pattern.  Turning -> asymmetric diameter adjustment (smaller diameter on inner wheels).
    *   **Output:**  Commands to segment motors and smart material actuators.
*   **Power:** Dedicated battery pack for wheel actuation system.  Regenerative braking to recapture energy during segment retraction.
*   **Communication:** CAN bus integration with AGV’s main control system.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Loop):**

```
// Initialization
initialize_sensors()
initialize_actuators()

while (AGV is operating) {
  terrain_data = read_terrain_sensors()
  wheel_force_data = read_wheel_force_sensors()
  planned_path = get_planned_path()
  
  optimal_wheel_config = calculate_optimal_config(terrain_data, wheel_force_data, planned_path)

  for each wheel segment {
    set_segment_radius(optimal_wheel_config.segment_radius)
    set_segment_tread(optimal_wheel_config.segment_tread)
  }
}
```

**Operational Modes:**

*   **Auto:** AI-driven dynamic adjustment based on sensor data.
*   **Manual:** Operator can override AI and manually adjust wheel parameters.
*   **Terrain Lock:**  "Locks" wheel configuration for consistent performance on specific terrain types.
