## Dynamic Resource Access Profiles with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend secure remote access by incorporating continuous behavioral biometric authentication *after* initial passwordless access is granted, and dynamically adjusting resource access privileges based on real-time behavioral analysis. This shifts from static, pre-defined permissions to a fluid system that adapts to the user’s typical behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Keyboard dynamics (typing speed, pressure, rhythm), mouse/trackpad movements (speed, acceleration, patterns), scrolling behavior, application usage patterns, and (optionally, with explicit user consent) subtle voice analysis during any integrated communication features.
*   **Collection Frequency:** Continuous, low-overhead data capture during active resource usage.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Noise filtering, normalization, and feature extraction to create a behavioral profile.  Emphasis on deriving features resistant to deliberate mimicry.
*   **Profile Storage:** Encrypted, secure storage of individual user behavioral profiles.  Profiles are continuously updated with recent behavior, employing a sliding window approach (e.g., last 30 days).

**2. Real-Time Behavioral Analysis Engine:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., autoencoders, one-class SVMs, recurrent neural networks) trained on individual user profiles to identify deviations from established behavioral norms.
*   **Risk Scoring:**  Assigns a continuous risk score based on the severity and frequency of detected anomalies.  Higher scores indicate potentially compromised access.
*   **Dynamic Privilege Adjustment:** Based on the risk score, the system dynamically adjusts resource access privileges.  This includes:
    *   **Tiered Access:** Resources are categorized into tiers (e.g., read-only, limited access, full access). The system lowers the access tier if the risk score exceeds a threshold.
    *   **Session Monitoring:** Higher risk scores trigger increased session monitoring (e.g., recording of screen activity, keystrokes, and mouse movements – for auditing purposes only, with appropriate user notifications).
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Challenge:** If the risk score reaches a critical threshold, the system prompts for an immediate MFA challenge.
    *   **Automatic Session Termination:** Extreme anomalies automatically terminate the session.

**3.  Resource Access Control Interface:**

*   **Policy Engine:** Allows administrators to define policies that map risk scores to specific access control actions.
*   **Auditing and Reporting:** Provides comprehensive audit logs of all access control events, including risk score changes and policy enforcement actions.
*   **User Management:**  Includes tools for managing user profiles, behavioral data, and access control policies.

**Pseudocode for Dynamic Privilege Adjustment:**

```
function adjustPrivileges(user, resource, riskScore) {
  if (riskScore > highThreshold) {
    terminateSession(user);
    logEvent("Session terminated due to high risk score");
  } else if (riskScore > mediumThreshold) {
    requestMFA(user);
    logEvent("MFA requested due to medium risk score");
  } else if (riskScore > lowThreshold) {
    downgradeResourceAccess(resource);
    logEvent("Resource access downgraded due to low risk score");
  } else {
    //Normal Operation
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This approach goes beyond static resource access controls by layering continuous authentication and dynamic privilege adjustment.  It addresses the risk of compromised credentials or insider threats by proactively adapting to user behavior *after* initial access is granted. It’s a shift from “verify once” to “verify continuously,” creating a more resilient and secure remote access system. The dynamic nature of privilege adjustments, based on real-time behavioral analysis, is a key differentiator.
