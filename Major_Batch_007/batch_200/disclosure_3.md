## Isolated Runtime Environment Attestation via Decentralized Identity & Verifiable Credentials

**Concept:** Expand upon the host attestation process by integrating a Decentralized Identity (DID) framework and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to create a more robust, trustless, and auditable system for isolated runtime environment verification.  Instead of a centralized resource verifier, the system leverages a network of independent attesters.

**Specifications:**

**1. DID Generation & Registration:**

*   Each virtualization host (the entity establishing the isolated runtime) generates a DID, uniquely identifying it.
*   The DID is registered on a distributed ledger (e.g., a blockchain or similar DLT).
*   The host's public key is associated with the DID, enabling cryptographic verification of attestations.

**2. VC Issuance – Host Attestation:**

*   Upon successful completion of preliminary environment setup (as described in the original patent), the host generates a VC.
*   The VC asserts specific claims about the environment:
    *   Host DID
    *   Hypervisor Version
    *   TPM Status (if applicable)
    *   Boot Integrity Hash (measured boot)
    *   Isolated Runtime Configuration (memory allocation, network restrictions – critical parameters)
    *   Timestamp of Attestation
*   The VC is digitally signed by the host’s private key (associated with its DID).

**3.  Attestation Network & Validator Selection:**

*   A network of independent validators (attestation nodes) exists. These validators are distributed and potentially operated by different entities (e.g., cloud providers, security firms, clients).
*   The client (or the virtualized computing service) specifies a desired level of attestation confidence (e.g., requiring signatures from *n* validators).
*   A selection algorithm (e.g., based on reputation, geographic diversity, or other criteria) chooses validators to participate in the attestation process.

**4. VC Verification & Aggregation:**

*   The host transmits the VC to the selected validators.
*   Each validator verifies the VC’s signature using the host’s public key (obtained from the DID).
*   Upon successful verification, the validator signs the original VC, creating a chained signature.  (VC + Validator Signature). This chaining adds layers of trust.
*   The client collects the chained VCs from the validators.

**5. Threshold Verification & Environment Launch:**

*   The client verifies that the number of valid validator signatures meets the pre-defined threshold.
*   If the threshold is met, the client receives the key needed to decrypt the machine image, and the isolated runtime environment is launched.

**6. Continuous Attestation & Revocation:**

*   The system implements a mechanism for periodic re-attestation of the runtime environment. This helps detect drift from the original trusted state.
*   A revocation list is maintained on the distributed ledger. This list identifies compromised hosts or revoked credentials, preventing unauthorized access.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function launchIsolatedRuntime(machineImage, clientDID):
  // 1. Select Validators (based on criteria & client requirements)
  validators = selectValidators(requiredCount: n)

  // 2. Request Attestation from Host & Validators
  attestationVC = host.getAttestationVC()
  validatorVCs = []
  for validator in validators:
    validatorVC = validator.verifyAndSign(attestationVC)
    validatorVCs.append(validatorVC)

  // 3. Verify Threshold
  if (countValidSignatures(validatorVCs) >= n):
    key = extractDecryptionKey(validatorVCs)
    decryptedImage = decryptImage(machineImage, key)
    launchRuntime(decryptedImage)
  else:
    // Attestation failed
    logError("Attestation failed: insufficient validator signatures")
    abortLaunch()
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Decentralized Trust:** Eliminates reliance on a single centralized resource verifier.
*   **Verifiable Credentials:** Leverages a standardized, interoperable credential format.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Chain of signatures from multiple validators strengthens security and auditability.
*   **Resilience:** Reduces the risk of single points of failure.
*   **Interoperability:** VCs can be shared and verified by different parties.
