## Dynamic Cache Profile Synthesis via Predictive User Modeling

**Concept:** Instead of *reacting* to request patterns to build cache profiles, proactively *predict* user needs and synthesize cache profiles *before* requests are even made. This moves from a reactive caching system to a predictive, personalized caching system, dramatically increasing hit rates and reducing latency.

**Specs:**

**1. User Modeling Component:**

*   **Input:** User identifier (login, cookie, device ID), historical request data (URLs, timestamps, device type, location – anonymized/aggregated where appropriate), contextual data (time of day, day of week, trending topics).
*   **Process:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to model user request sequences. The LSTM will learn to predict the next likely request(s) given the user’s history and current context.  This isn’t about predicting *exact* URLs, but *types* of resources – e.g., “news article related to technology,” “product page for running shoes,” “social media feed update.”
*   **Output:** A “predicted request vector” representing the probability distribution over different resource types the user is likely to request next.  This vector informs the Cache Profile Synthesis Component.

**2. Cache Profile Synthesis Component:**

*   **Input:** Predicted request vector from the User Modeling Component, existing cache profiles (as a baseline), a knowledge graph of web resources (categorizing URLs by type, topic, dependencies, etc.).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Profile Candidate Generation:** Based on the predicted request vector, identify a set of *candidate* cache profiles. If the prediction is strong for a specific resource type (e.g., 90% probability of requesting news articles), prioritize creating or updating profiles for that type.
    2.  **Content Pre-fetching & Analysis:**  Initiate pre-fetching of content associated with the predicted request vector (e.g., headlines from technology news sites). Analyze this content to identify temporally invariable parts, similar to the original patent.
    3.  **Dynamic Profile Creation/Update:**  Create new cache profiles or update existing ones based on the analyzed content and the predicted request vector.  The profile will include:
        *   Resource Type (e.g., “technology news article”)
        *   Temporally Invariable Parts (identified content fragments)
        *   Probability Weight (based on the predicted request vector)
        *   Dependencies (other resources this profile relies on)
*   **Output:** A dynamically synthesized cache profile ready for use by the caching system.

**3. Caching System Integration:**

*   The caching system will maintain a prioritized list of cache profiles based on their probability weights.
*   When a request arrives, the system will:
    1.  Identify the user and obtain their predicted request vector.
    2.  Match the request to the highest-priority cache profiles.
    3.  Serve cached content from those profiles if available.
    4.  If content is missing, fetch it and update the corresponding cache profile.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// User Modeling Component
function predictNextRequest(userID, history, context) {
  // LSTM model predicts resource type probabilities
  return resourceTypeProbabilities;
}

// Cache Profile Synthesis Component
function synthesizeCacheProfile(resourceTypeProbabilities, existingProfiles) {
  // Identify candidate profiles
  candidateProfiles = selectProfilesBasedOnProbabilities(resourceTypeProbabilities);

  // Prefetch content and analyze
  prefetchContent(candidateProfiles);
  invariableParts = analyzeContent(candidateProfiles);

  // Create/Update profile
  newProfile = createOrUpdateProfile(invariableParts, resourceTypeProbabilities);

  return newProfile;
}

// Caching System
function processRequest(request, userID) {
  predictedProbabilities = predictNextRequest(userID, history, context);
  bestProfile = findBestProfile(predictedProbabilities, cacheProfiles);

  if (bestProfile.hasCachedContent(request)) {
    return bestProfile.getCachedContent();
  } else {
    // Fetch content and update profile
    content = fetchContent(request);
    bestProfile.updateCache(content);
    return content;
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This system isn’t simply reacting to observed patterns; it’s proactively *predicting* user needs and preparing the cache *before* the request arrives. This moves beyond traditional caching techniques and opens the door to a truly personalized and predictive caching experience. The use of RNNs (LSTMs) for user modeling and dynamic profile synthesis is a key differentiator.
