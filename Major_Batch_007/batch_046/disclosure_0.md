## Transactional Code Mirroring & Predictive Retries

**Concept:** Extend the snapshot/retry concept to not just revert *to* a prior state, but to *actively mirror* transaction execution in a parallel, read-only virtual environment. This mirror can be used to *predict* potential transaction failures *before* they occur, allowing for preemptive adjustments or alternative code paths.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** *Predictive Transaction Mirror (PTM)* – A system component residing within the on-demand code execution framework.
*   **Trigger:** Activation occurs alongside normal transactional code execution (as defined by metadata tags within user-submitted code).
*   **Snapshotting:**  Upon reaching the transaction start point (first statement), two snapshots are generated:
    *   *Execution Snapshot*: As currently implemented – used for standard retries.
    *   *Mirror Snapshot*: A read-only copy of the virtual environment’s state.
*   **Mirror Execution:**  The user-submitted code is *simultaneously* executed in both the primary and mirror environments. The mirror environment is configured to *not* write any changes to persistent storage or external systems. All actions are logged/observed.
*   **Predictive Analysis Module (PAM):** Continuously analyzes the mirror environment’s execution. The PAM uses a rules engine and potentially machine learning models to identify potential failure scenarios based on:
    *   Resource contention (e.g., database locks) – observable in the mirror.
    *   Data validation errors – observable in the mirror.
    *   External service timeouts – predicted based on mirror response times.
    *   Deviation from expected behavior – based on pre-defined baselines or learned models.
*   **Preemptive Adjustment:** If the PAM predicts a high probability of failure:
    *   **Code Path Diversion:** If the transaction allows for alternative execution paths (defined in metadata), the primary execution can be diverted *before* the failure occurs.  This is akin to a circuit breaker pattern.
    *   **Parameter Adjustment:**  Transaction parameters (e.g., retry count, timeout values) can be dynamically adjusted in the primary execution.
    *   **Resource Allocation:**  Request additional resources (e.g., increased memory, CPU) for the primary execution.
*   **Metadata Requirements:**
    *   `transaction_id`: Unique identifier for the transaction.
    *   `failure_prediction_enabled`: Boolean flag to enable/disable the feature.
    *   `alternative_paths`: List of alternative code paths to take in case of predicted failure (code snippets or function names).
    *   `resource_requirements`: Suggested resources for the primary execution.
    *   `success_criteria`: (As currently implemented)

**Pseudocode (PAM):**

```
function analyze_mirror_execution(mirror_environment_state, transaction_id):
  failure_probability = 0.0

  // Check for resource contention
  if resource_contention_detected(mirror_environment_state):
    failure_probability += 0.2

  // Check for data validation errors
  if data_validation_error_detected(mirror_environment_state):
    failure_probability += 0.4

  // Check for predicted timeouts
  predicted_timeout = predict_timeout(mirror_environment_state)
  if predicted_timeout > acceptable_timeout:
    failure_probability += 0.3

  // Check deviation from expected behavior (using learned models)
  deviation_score = calculate_deviation_score(mirror_environment_state)
  if deviation_score > threshold:
    failure_probability += 0.1

  return failure_probability
```

**Rationale:** This proactively addresses transaction failures *before* they happen, potentially improving application reliability and reducing latency. It allows for more intelligent handling of transactions beyond simple retries. The predictive analysis module is a key component, leveraging data from the mirror environment to anticipate and mitigate problems.
