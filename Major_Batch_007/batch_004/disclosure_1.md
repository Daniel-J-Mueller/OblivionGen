## Dynamic Trust Scoring with Behavioral Biometrics & Network Metadata

**Concept:** Extend the network metadata validation concept by incorporating real-time behavioral biometrics of the computing resource accessing the cloud network.  This creates a dynamic trust score, influencing access authorization *beyond* simple network identifier matching.

**Specification:**

**1. Behavioral Biometric Profiling:**

*   **Data Collection:** Implement agents on computing resources (or within virtual machines) that collect behavioral data. This includes:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure)
    *   Mouse movement patterns (speed, acceleration, trajectory)
    *   System call frequency & patterns.
    *   Resource utilization patterns (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
*   **Profile Creation:** Establish a baseline behavioral profile for each authorized computing resource *during* initial access or a trusted state.  This profile is encrypted and securely stored within the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** During ongoing access, continuously collect behavioral data and compare it against the stored baseline profile.  Calculate a 'Behavioral Deviation Score' - a numerical representation of how much the current behavior deviates from the established baseline.

**2. Network Metadata Integration:**

*   **Enhanced Session Token:**  Modify the session token generated by the security token service.  Include not only the virtual private network (VPN) identifier but also:
    *   A hash of the initial behavioral profile.
    *   A timestamp of the profile creation.
*   **Header Information Augmentation:** The VPN endpoint adds the standard VPN identifier to header information.  Also include:
    *   A cryptographic signature of the current behavioral data.
    *   A unique session ID.

**3. Dynamic Trust Score Calculation:**

*   **IAM Service Logic:** The IAM service receives the request, session token, and header information.
*   **Validation Steps:**
    1.  **Network Identifier Match:** Verify that the VPN identifiers in the session token and header match, as in the original patent.
    2.  **Behavioral Signature Verification:** Decrypt the initial behavioral profile hash from the session token. Verify the signature in the header against the current behavioral data. If the signature is invalid, assign a high behavioral deviation score.
    3.  **Deviation Score Calculation:** Combine the network identifier match result (binary - pass/fail) with the behavioral deviation score. Use a weighted formula to calculate a Dynamic Trust Score (DTS):

        `DTS = (NetworkMatchWeight * NetworkMatchResult) + (BehavioralWeight * (1 - NormalizedBehavioralDeviationScore))`

        *   `NetworkMatchWeight` & `BehavioralWeight` are configurable parameters to prioritize network or behavioral data.
        *   `NormalizedBehavioralDeviationScore` is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 represents perfect profile adherence.

**4. Adaptive Access Control:**

*   **Policy Integration:**  Modify IAM policies to incorporate the DTS. Policies can define access thresholds based on the DTS.  For example:
    *   **High DTS (e.g., > 0.9):**  Grant full access.
    *   **Medium DTS (e.g., 0.5 - 0.9):**  Grant limited access or require multi-factor authentication.
    *   **Low DTS (e.g., < 0.5):**  Deny access or initiate an alert.
*   **Real-time Adjustment:** Continuously monitor the DTS during the session. If the DTS falls below a defined threshold, dynamically adjust access privileges or terminate the session.

**Pseudocode (IAM Service Policy Evaluation):**

```
function evaluatePolicy(request, sessionToken, headerInfo) {
  networkMatch = verifyNetworkIdentifiers(sessionToken, headerInfo)
  behavioralDeviation = calculateBehavioralDeviation(sessionToken, headerInfo)
  DTS = (NetworkMatchWeight * networkMatch) + (BehavioralWeight * (1 - behavioralDeviation))

  if (DTS > HighDTSThreshold) {
    return ALLOW
  } else if (DTS > MediumDTSThreshold) {
    // Request MFA
    return CHALLENGE
  } else {
    return DENY
  }
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:** Use machine learning to detect anomalous behavior patterns that deviate significantly from the established baseline.
*   **Contextual Analysis:** Incorporate contextual information, such as user location, time of day, and device type, to refine the DTS calculation.
*   **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Integrate threat intelligence feeds to identify known malicious actors or compromised devices.
