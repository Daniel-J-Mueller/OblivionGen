## Dynamic Network Slicing Based on User Behavioral Prediction

**System Overview:**

This system extends the concept of edge computing and container deployment by dynamically adjusting network slices *before* a mobility event occurs, anticipating user needs based on predicted behavior. It moves beyond reacting to mobility; it proactively prepares the network.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Prediction Engine (BPE):** A machine learning model trained on user data (location history, application usage, time of day, etc.) to predict future mobility patterns and application demands. This operates *separate* from the control plane described in the patent, feeding predictions *to* it.  The BPE outputs a “demand profile” for each user/device.

2.  **Proactive Slice Orchestrator (PSO):**  This component sits *between* the BPE and the control plane. It receives demand profiles and translates them into requests for network slice adjustments.  It maintains a "slice readiness map" showing available resources in different edge locations.

3.  **Control Plane Adaptation:** The existing control plane (from the patent) is modified to accept "pre-emptive slice requests" from the PSO, in addition to the existing reactivity.

4.  **Edge Resource Pool:** Expanded to include more granular resource allocation – not just containers, but also dedicated bandwidth, QoS parameters, and even dedicated processing cores – all configurable *before* a user arrives.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  The BPE continuously analyzes user data and generates demand profiles (e.g., "User A will likely move from location X to location Y within 15 minutes, and will be streaming high-bandwidth video").

2.  The PSO receives the demand profile and queries the slice readiness map.

3.  If resources are available at the predicted destination edge location, the PSO sends a pre-emptive slice request to the control plane.  This request specifies:
    *   Target edge location.
    *   Required bandwidth.
    *   QoS parameters (latency, jitter).
    *   Container image to pre-stage (optional, can be fetched on demand, but pre-staging reduces latency).
    *   A “time to live” (TTL) – if the user doesn't arrive within the TTL, the slice is released.

4.  The control plane provisions the requested resources at the target edge location, launching/configuring containers and allocating bandwidth.

5.  When the user actually arrives at the new location, the system seamlessly switches the user to the pre-provisioned slice.

6.  If the pre-provisioned slice isn't used (user changed plans), it's automatically released after the TTL expires.

**Pseudocode (PSO - core logic):**

```
function processDemandProfile(user, demandProfile):
  predictedLocation = demandProfile.predictedLocation
  requiredBandwidth = demandProfile.requiredBandwidth
  qosParameters = demandProfile.qosParameters
  ttl = demandProfile.ttl

  availableResources = querySliceReadinessMap(predictedLocation, requiredBandwidth, qosParameters)

  if availableResources:
    sliceRequest = createSliceRequest(predictedLocation, requiredBandwidth, qosParameters, ttl)
    sendSliceRequestToControlPlane(sliceRequest)
  else:
    //Log resource unavailability. Explore options like scaling up resources or queuing the request.
    logResourceUnavailability(predictedLocation, requiredBandwidth, qosParameters)
```

**Innovation & Differentiation:**

*   **Proactive vs. Reactive:** Moves beyond reacting to mobility events to proactively preparing the network.
*   **Behavioral Prediction:** Utilizes machine learning to anticipate user needs, improving the user experience.
*   **Granular Resource Allocation:** Allocates resources *before* a user arrives, reducing latency and improving performance.
*   **Dynamic Slice Management:**  Automatically adjusts network slices based on user behavior, optimizing resource utilization.
*   **Time-to-Live (TTL):** Prevents resource wastage by automatically releasing unused slices.
