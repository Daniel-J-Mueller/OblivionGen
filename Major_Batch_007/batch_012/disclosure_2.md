## Dynamic Contextual Highlighting & 'Emotional Resonance' Mapping

**Specification:** Implement a system that goes beyond simple passage favoriting to build a dynamic, user-specific 'emotional resonance' map *within* the text, expressed through contextual highlighting. 

**Core Concept:** Instead of just marking a passage as "favorite", the system analyzes user interaction (time spent, re-reads, sensor data - holding the device, proximity) *in relation to the surrounding text*. This allows it to infer not just *what* the user likes, but *why* – the specific phrasing, concepts, or context that trigger engagement.

**System Components:**

1.  **Granular Interaction Tracking:** Track time spent on *every sentence/phrase* (determined via text segmentation) along with all existing tracked metrics (total time, re-reads). Integrate sensor data – device angle (indicating focus), grip pressure (indicating emotional response), and proximity to the user's face (indicating intense reading).
2.  **Contextual Analysis Engine:** Analyze the immediate surrounding text (N sentences before/after the currently viewed passage). Extract key entities, concepts, and sentiment using NLP.  This creates a 'context vector' for each passage.
3.  **Resonance Vector Generation:** Combine interaction metrics and context vectors to generate a 'resonance vector' for each passage. This vector represents the user’s engagement with that specific context.  Weighting factors can be adjusted based on user preference.
4.  **Dynamic Highlighting System:**  Implement a multi-layered highlighting scheme.
    *   **Base Layer:**  Standard highlighting for passages identified as ‘favorites’ based on current methods.
    *   **Resonance Layer:**  Dynamic highlighting based on the resonance vector.  Colors could represent:
        *   *Intensity*: How strongly the user engaged with the passage and its context.
        *   *Emotional Tone*:  Sentiment analysis of the surrounding text, projected onto the passage.  (e.g., passages associated with positive sentiment are highlighted in warmer colors, negative in cooler colors).
        *   *Conceptual Affinity*:  Highlight passages with shared concepts, regardless of 'favorite' status, to show thematic connections.
5.  **User Interface:**  Allow users to customize the highlighting scheme (colors, intensity, layers). Provide a 'resonance map' visualization – a heatmap of the text showing engagement levels and emotional tones.  Allow exploration of the resonance map – clicking on a highlighted passage reveals the contributing factors (time spent, sensor data, surrounding context).
6.  **Predictive Engagement Engine:** Use the resonance vectors to predict future engagement. Suggest related passages based on conceptual affinity and emotional tone.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each passage:
passageResonanceVector = calculateResonanceVector(passage, interactionData, contextData)

// Calculate Resonance Vector
function calculateResonanceVector(passage, interactionData, contextData):
    timeSpentWeight = 0.5
    reReadWeight = 0.3
    sensorDataWeight = 0.2

    timeScore = interactionData.timeSpent * timeSpentWeight
    reReadScore = interactionData.reReadCount * reReadWeight
    sensorScore = calculateSensorScore(interactionData.sensorData) * sensorDataWeight

    contextVector = analyzeContext(passage) // NLP Analysis

    resonanceVector = timeScore + reReadScore + sensorScore + contextVector

    return resonanceVector

// Apply Highlighting
function applyHighlighting(text, resonanceVectors):
    for each passage in text:
        resonance = resonanceVectors[passage]
        if resonance > threshold:
            highlightColor = determineHighlightColor(resonance)
            highlightPassage(passage, highlightColor)
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Cross-Book Resonance:**  Extend the resonance map across multiple books to identify recurring themes and emotional triggers for the user.
*   **Social Resonance:**  Share resonance maps with other users to discover shared interests and recommendations.
*   **Adaptive Difficulty:**  Adjust the complexity of the text based on the user’s resonance map.

This system aims to go beyond simple preference tracking and provide a more nuanced understanding of *how* and *why* a user engages with text, creating a truly personalized reading experience.
