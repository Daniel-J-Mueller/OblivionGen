## Personalized Content 'Ecosystem' with Dynamic Rights Management

**Concept:** Extend the remote storage idea into a full-fledged, user-controlled content ecosystem where rights aren't just about *access*, but about *usage* and *modification*.  Think beyond simply storing movies or music; envision a space for interactive stories, modifiable game assets, or remixable creative content—all managed by the user with granular control.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Storage:**  Utilize the existing remote storage framework as the foundation. Scalable, secure, and accessible across devices.
*   **Content 'Containers':**  Introduce the concept of 'Content Containers'. These aren't simple files; they encapsulate the content *and* a rights manifest. The manifest defines *what* the user (and potentially, authorized others) can do with the content.  Examples of rights:  View, Play, Edit (with limitations – see below), Remix, Share (with limitations), Distribute (limited), Commercial Use (explicitly granted/denied).
*   **Dynamic Rights Engine:** A server-side engine that enforces the rights manifest. Every access request goes through this engine.
*   **‘Edit Sandboxes’:** If ‘Edit’ rights are granted, access happens within a sandbox environment. This prevents malicious modifications from affecting the original content.  The user can create derivative works within the sandbox.
*   **Derivative Work Tracking:**  The system automatically tracks all derivatives created from original content.  The original content owner (if different from the user) receives notifications and potentially a share of revenue generated from derivative works (defined by pre-agreed terms).
*   **Smart Contract Integration (Optional):**  For complex rights arrangements (revenue sharing, collaborative creation), integrate with blockchain-based smart contracts to automate and ensure transparency.
*   **User Interface (Client-Side):**
    *   A content management UI showing all stored content *and* associated rights.
    *   A visual rights editor allowing users to define and modify rights for each content item.
    *   A ‘Derivatives’ view showing all works created from a specific piece of content.

**Pseudocode (Rights Engine - Simplified):**

```
function processAccessRequest(userID, contentID, accessType) {
  rightsManifest = getRightsManifest(contentID);
  if (rightsManifest.isUserAuthorized(userID, accessType)) {
    if (accessType == "Edit") {
      createSandbox(userID, contentID);
      return "Access Granted (Sandbox)";
    } else {
      return "Access Granted";
    }
  } else {
    return "Access Denied";
  }
}

function isUserAuthorized(userID, accessType) {
  // Check if user has explicit permission for this accessType
  if (rightsManifest.allowedUsers.includes(userID) || rightsManifest.publicAccess) {
    if(rightsManifest.allowedAccessTypes.includes(accessType)){
        return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple DRM and storage. It transforms the user into a content *curator* and *creator* with control over not just *access*, but *usage*.  It opens up new possibilities for interactive storytelling, user-generated content ecosystems, and the monetization of creative works.
