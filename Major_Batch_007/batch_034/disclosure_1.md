## Dynamic Vocal Texture Synthesis

**Concept:** Leverage the acoustic/semantic language model (ASLM) framework, not to *continue* speech, but to dynamically alter the *texture* of existing speech in real-time, guided by a separate input stream representing desired vocal qualities. This moves beyond voice cloning to true vocal performance control.

**Specs:**

1.  **Input:**
    *   Source Audio: Real-time audio stream of speech.
    *   Texture Control Stream: A multi-dimensional vector representing desired vocal characteristics. Dimensions might include:
        *   Roughness (0-1)
        *   Breathiness (0-1)
        *   Resonance (frequency value)
        *   Vibrato Rate (Hz)
        *   Vibrato Depth (dB)
        *   Emotional Valence (-1 to 1)
        *   Emotional Arousal (-1 to 1)
        *   Age (estimated age value)
        *   Gender (probability vector - male/female/other)
2.  **Encoding:**  Source audio is fed into the neural network encoder.  Simultaneously, the Texture Control Stream is encoded into a Texture Vector.
3.  **ASLM Modification:** The encoded audio is *not* directly used for continuation. Instead, the Texture Vector is used to *modify* the encoded audio representation within the latent space *before* decoding. This is the core innovation.  Modification can be achieved via:
    *   **Additive Mixing:** The Texture Vector is added to the encoded audio, scaling the texture vector to avoid saturation.
    *   **Attention Mechanism:** An attention layer uses the Texture Vector as a query to attend to specific parts of the encoded audio, emphasizing or suppressing certain features.
    *   **Conditional Layer Normalization:** Texture Vector parameters are used in layer normalization layers within the ASLM to control feature distributions.
4.  **Decoding:** The modified encoded audio is passed to the neural network decoder to generate the modified audio output.
5.  **Real-Time Processing:**  The system is designed for low latency to enable real-time modification of audio.  Chunking of audio streams is acceptable if latency requirements are met.
6.  **Training Data:**  A dataset of speech with corresponding vocal texture labels (roughness, breathiness, emotion, etc.) is required. This data can be augmented using audio effects processing and parameter variations to create a wider range of training examples.
7. **Pseudocode:**

```
function modify_speech(source_audio, texture_control_stream):
  encoded_audio = encoder(source_audio)
  texture_vector = encode_texture(texture_control_stream) # optional texture encoding

  modified_encoded_audio = modify_latent_space(encoded_audio, texture_vector) #Core innovation. 

  modified_audio = decoder(modified_encoded_audio)

  return modified_audio

function modify_latent_space(encoded_audio, texture_vector):
  #Example implementation: Attention Mechanism
  attention_weights = softmax(texture_vector @ encoded_audio.transpose())
  context_vector = attention_weights @ encoded_audio
  modified_encoded_audio = encoded_audio + context_vector #Additive mixing
  return modified_encoded_audio
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Live vocal effects processing.
*   Voice acting with dynamic emotional control.
*   Accessibility tools for speech enhancement.
*   Creative music production and sound design.
