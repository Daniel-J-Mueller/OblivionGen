## Adaptive Content Fingerprinting & Drift Detection

**Concept:** Expand the synonym substitution beyond simple obfuscation for DRM or tracking. Utilize it as a dynamic, content-level "fingerprint" capable of detecting subtle alterations *within* the text itself – not just copies. This moves beyond identifying *where* content is copied *to* detecting *how* content is being *changed*.

**Specs:**

1.  **Dynamic Synonym Graph:**
    *   A directed graph where nodes represent keywords/concepts.
    *   Edges represent synonym relationships, weighted by semantic similarity (determined by a language model).
    *   The graph is *mutable* – weights can change based on usage patterns, emerging slang, or authorial style. This is critical to avoid static fingerprints.
2.  **Content Encoding Procedure:**
    *   Input: Original textual content.
    *   Process:
        *   Tokenize the text.
        *   For each token:
            *   Identify corresponding node in the Dynamic Synonym Graph.
            *   Select a synonym from the node's associated list, *weighted by a pseudo-random number generator seeded by a content-specific key* (e.g., the first 10 words of the document). This key ensures consistency within a single document but introduces variation across documents.
            *   Replace the original token with the selected synonym.
    *   Output: Encoded textual content with dynamically substituted synonyms.
3.  **Drift Detection Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Original content, encoded content, and a drift threshold.
    *   Process:
        *   Re-encode the original content using the *same* seed and Dynamic Synonym Graph.
        *   Compare the re-encoded content to the original encoded content.
        *   Calculate a "drift score" based on the number of differing tokens.
        *   If the drift score exceeds the threshold, flag the content as altered.
    *   Output: Drift score and alteration flag.
4.  **Feedback Loop & Graph Adaptation:**
    *   Monitor drift scores across a corpus of content.
    *   Identify common patterns in altered content.
    *   Adjust the weights in the Dynamic Synonym Graph to *increase* the likelihood of selecting synonyms that mask those common alterations.
    *   This creates a self-learning system that adapts to evolving manipulation techniques.

**Pseudocode (Drift Detection):**

```
function detect_drift(original_content, encoded_content, drift_threshold):
  seed = extract_seed(original_content)  // Extract key from content
  reencoded_content = encode(original_content, seed)
  diff_count = 0
  for i in range(length(reencoded_content)):
    if reencoded_content[i] != encoded_content[i]:
      diff_count += 1
  drift_score = diff_count / length(reencoded_content)
  if drift_score > drift_threshold:
    return "ALTERED", drift_score
  else:
    return "UNCHANGED", drift_score
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Detecting subtle edits in legal documents or scientific papers.**
*   **Identifying manipulated news articles.**
*   **Protecting against adversarial attacks on AI models.**
*   **Provenance tracking of content as it evolves through collaborative editing.**
*   **Content integrity verification for long-term archiving.**
