## Adaptive Predictive Streaming with Environmental Context

**Concept:** Expand the battery-aware interval adjustments to incorporate environmental data – not just battery level – to *predict* user access needs and proactively adjust streaming quality/buffering *before* battery depletion significantly impacts performance. This aims for a smoother user experience and optimized bandwidth/battery usage.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate ambient light sensor, accelerometer, and optional microphone into the A/V device.
*   **Data Collection & Processing:**
    *   Device collects data on ambient light level (indicating time of day/activity), motion (detecting potential user movement/interaction), and audio levels (detecting potential triggers like doorbells or voices).
    *   Local processor runs a simple machine learning model (e.g., decision tree, naive bayes) trained to predict probability of user access based on sensor data. The model is initially pre-trained, but continuously refined via on-device learning based on user interaction (or lack thereof).
    *   Prediction output: A ‘User Access Probability’ score (0.0 – 1.0).
*   **Adaptive Streaming Control:**
    *   Based on the ‘User Access Probability’ *and* battery level, dynamically adjust the following:
        *   **Data Request Interval:**  Shorter interval when probability *or* battery is high. Longer interval when both are low.
        *   **Streaming Quality:** Reduce streaming resolution/frame rate when probability is low *and* battery is low. Increase when both are high.
        *   **Buffering:** Increase buffer size when probability is high and battery is high to ensure smooth playback. Reduce buffer size when both are low.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   Data Requests: Include ‘User Access Probability’ score *and* current battery level.  Server uses this data to fine-tune prediction models and optimize server-side resources.
*   **Pseudocode (Processor Logic):**

```pseudocode
//Initialization
PRETRAINED_MODEL = loadModel("access_prediction.model")
BUFFER_SIZE = DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE
STREAMING_QUALITY = DEFAULT_QUALITY

//Main Loop
while (deviceActive) {
    batteryLevel = getBatteryLevel()
    ambientLight = getAmbientLight()
    motionDetected = getMotionDetected()

    //Predict User Access Probability
    userAccessProbability = PRETRAINED_MODEL.predict(batteryLevel, ambientLight, motionDetected)

    //Adjust Data Request Interval
    if (userAccessProbability > HIGH_THRESHOLD || batteryLevel < LOW_THRESHOLD) {
        dataRequestInterval = SHORT_INTERVAL
    } else if (userAccessProbability < LOW_THRESHOLD && batteryLevel > HIGH_THRESHOLD) {
        dataRequestInterval = LONG_INTERVAL
    } else {
        dataRequestInterval = DEFAULT_INTERVAL
    }

    //Adjust Streaming Quality
    if (userAccessProbability < QUALITY_THRESHOLD && batteryLevel < QUALITY_THRESHOLD) {
        streamingQuality = LOW_QUALITY
    } else {
        streamingQuality = HIGH_QUALITY
    }

    //Adjust Buffer Size
    if (userAccessProbability > BUFFER_THRESHOLD && batteryLevel > BUFFER_THRESHOLD) {
        bufferSize = LARGE_BUFFER
    } else {
        bufferSize = DEFAULT_BUFFER
    }

    sendDataRequest(dataRequestInterval)

    processResponse()
}
```

*   **Potential Refinements:**
    *   **Geofencing:** Integrate geofencing to determine user proximity to the device.
    *   **User Schedules:** Allow users to input typical activity schedules for even more accurate predictions.
    *   **Server-Side Learning:** Use aggregated data from all devices to build a more robust and accurate prediction model on the server.
