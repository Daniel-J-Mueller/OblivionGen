## Dynamic Video Stitching for Personalized Product Demonstrations

**Concept:** Leverage pre-fetching, as described in the provided patent, to not just buffer a *single* video, but to dynamically assemble a short, personalized product demonstration video from modular segments *before* the user explicitly selects the item.

**Specs:**

**1. Video Asset Library:**

*   **Structure:** A library of short (5-15 second) video clips demonstrating individual features or use cases of various products. Clips are categorized by product ID, feature demonstrated, and potentially, user demographics (e.g., skill level, intended use).
*   **Metadata:** Each clip has associated metadata detailing:
    *   Product ID
    *   Feature Demonstrated
    *   User Demographic Tags
    *   Seamless Transition Points (beginning/end frames optimized for smooth connection to other clips)
    *   Visual Style/Tone (e.g., "professional," "playful," "technical")

**2.  Prefetching & Assembly Logic (runs on client-side â€“ browser/app):**

*   **Trigger:** When a user hovers/focuses on a product on a listing page (similar to the "indication of user interest" in the patent), the system initiates a prefetch request.
*   **Profile Building:** The system retrieves a user profile (or creates a default if unavailable), including demographic data, purchase history, browsing behavior, and explicitly stated preferences.
*   **Segment Selection:** Based on the product ID and user profile, the system intelligently selects 3-5 video segments from the asset library. Selection criteria prioritize:
    *   Relevance to the product and the user's presumed needs.
    *   Seamless transitions between segments.
    *   Variety of features showcased.
*   **Dynamic Stitching:** The selected segments are downloaded and dynamically stitched together into a single, short video clip. This stitching process should:
    *   Ensure smooth transitions between segments using cross-dissolves, wipes, or other visual effects.
    *   Add a short introductory title card displaying the product name.
    *   Add a short concluding call to action (e.g., "Learn More," "Add to Cart").
*   **Buffering & Playback:** The assembled video is buffered in the background. When the user clicks/selects the product, the buffered video begins playing *immediately* (as in the original patent), providing a personalized demonstration.

**3.  System Architecture:**

*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** The video asset library is hosted on a CDN for fast and reliable delivery.
*   **API Endpoint:** A dedicated API endpoint handles requests for video segment selection and assembly.
*   **Client-Side JavaScript/Native App Code:**  Handles the prefetching, buffering, and playback logic on the user's device.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function onProductHover(productID, userProfile) {
  fetchVideoSegments(productID, userProfile)
    .then(segments => {
      assembleVideo(segments); // Stitch together segments
      bufferVideo();
    })
    .catch(error => {
      // Handle errors (e.g., fallback to static video)
    });
}

function assembleVideo(segments) {
  // Logic to stitch segments together with transitions
  // Add intro/outro cards
  return assembledVideo;
}

function bufferVideo() {
  // Start buffering the assembled video in the background
}

function onProductClick() {
  // Play the buffered video immediately
}
```

**Novelty:**

This goes beyond pre-buffering a single video. It dynamically *creates* a personalized video experience based on user data and a library of modular content. This allows for a much more engaging and informative product presentation. This also avoids having to produce a huge number of static videos for every product variant.
