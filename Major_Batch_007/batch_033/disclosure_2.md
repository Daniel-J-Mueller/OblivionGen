## Adaptive Resolution Mapping for Complex Functions

**Concept:** Extend the mapping table approach to dynamically adjust the granularity (resolution) of base values within the table based on real-time analysis of the input data distribution. This addresses scenarios where a uniform distribution of base values is inefficient – particularly with functions exhibiting rapid changes in certain regions.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware Components:**
    *   **Input Data Analyzer:** A dedicated circuit that continuously monitors incoming input values. It calculates statistics like variance, kurtosis, and derivative estimates over sliding windows.
    *   **Resolution Control Unit (RCU):** Based on the data analyzer’s output, the RCU adjusts the spacing between base values within specific blocks (or sub-regions) of the mapping table.  This is achieved by dynamically allocating more or fewer buckets to a given input range.
    *   **Mapping Table (MT):** The core storage. Supports dynamic bucket allocation.  Uses a hierarchical structure – blocks of buckets – allowing for coarse-grained resolution changes.
    *   **Interpolation Engine:**  Handles input values that fall *between* defined base values. Uses higher-order interpolation schemes (splines, rational functions) when high-resolution regions demand it.
    *   **Arithmetic Circuit:**  As in the original patent, handles the final extrapolation.

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   **Block Descriptor Table:** Stores metadata for each block of the MT:
        *   `start_address`:  Physical address of the block’s first bucket.
        *   `block_size`: Number of buckets in the block.
        *   `base_spacing`: Distance between base values *within* the block.  This is the dynamically adjusted value.
        *   `interpolation_order`:  Specifies the interpolation scheme to use within the block.
    *   **Mapping Table (MT):**  Buckets store:
        *   `base_value`
        *   `function_output` (at `base_value`)
        *   `derivatives` (or Taylor series coefficients) – adjustable length based on `interpolation_order`.

*   **Operation:**

    1.  **Input Data Analysis:** The Input Data Analyzer continuously monitors incoming input values and calculates statistical measures.

    2.  **Resolution Adjustment:**  The RCU uses the statistical data to determine regions of high variability.
        *   **High Variability:** The RCU decreases `base_spacing` within the corresponding block of the MT, allocating more buckets to that region.  It also increases `interpolation_order`.
        *   **Low Variability:** The RCU increases `base_spacing` and lowers `interpolation_order`.

    3.  **Mapping Table Access:**
        *   Based on the input value, determine the appropriate block (using the Block Descriptor Table).
        *   Calculate the offset within the block.
        *   Access the appropriate bucket.

    4.  **Interpolation:** If the input value falls between base values, use the specified interpolation scheme (determined by `interpolation_order`).

    5.  **Extrapolation:** The Arithmetic Circuit performs the final extrapolation based on the interpolated values and derivatives.

*   **Pseudocode (Resolution Adjustment):**

    ```
    function adjust_resolution(input_data_stats):
      for each block in Block Descriptor Table:
        if block.variability > threshold:
          block.base_spacing = block.base_spacing * reduction_factor
          block.interpolation_order = block.interpolation_order + 1
          allocate_more_buckets(block)
        else if block.variability < threshold:
          block.base_spacing = block.base_spacing * expansion_factor
          block.interpolation_order = block.interpolation_order - 1
          deallocate_buckets(block)
    ```

*   **Considerations:**
    *   Dynamic bucket allocation requires careful memory management.
    *   Overhead of data analysis and resolution adjustment.
    *   Trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.
    *   Power consumption of dynamic memory operations.
