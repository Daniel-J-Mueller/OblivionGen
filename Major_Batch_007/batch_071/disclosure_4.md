## Modular Environmental Data Acquisition System – “Flora”

**System Overview:** A distributed network of small, wirelessly connected environmental monitoring nodes integrated *within* artificial foliage. These “leaves” house miniature sensors and cameras, providing hyper-local data and visual streams for precision environmental analysis – indoors or outdoors. The system prioritizes aesthetics and seamless integration, moving data acquisition *into* the environment rather than adding to it.

**Hardware Specs:**

*   **“Leaf” Node:**
    *   Dimensions: Mimic natural leaf shapes (variable, 5-15cm length). Constructed from durable, UV-resistant polymer with realistic texture/veining.
    *   Sensors:
        *   Micro-particle matter sensor (PM2.5, PM10)
        *   Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) sensor
        *   Temperature/Humidity sensor
        *   Light intensity sensor (visible & UV)
        *   Microphone (ambient sound analysis)
        *   Optional: Soil moisture/nutrient sensor (for potted plant integration)
    *   Camera: Miniature (2-3mm diameter) low-power CMOS camera with wide-angle lens. Capable of capturing still images & streaming low-resolution video.
    *   Wireless Communication: LoRaWAN or BLE mesh network. Range: up to 500m depending on environment.
    *   Power: Small solar panel integrated into “leaf” surface, supplemented by rechargeable battery (wireless charging capability).
    *   Mounting: Flexible, adjustable stem for attachment to branches, railings, or other structures. Magnetic base option.

*   **“Branch” Gateway:**
    *   Central hub for collecting data from “Leaf” nodes.
    *   Housed in a stylized “branch” enclosure.
    *   Data storage (local and cloud upload).
    *   Power: AC adapter or solar panel.
    *   Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Cellular (optional).

**Software/Firmware:**

*   **Node Firmware:**
    *   Sensor data acquisition and pre-processing.
    *   Image capture and compression.
    *   Wireless communication protocol implementation.
    *   Power management.
    *   Over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates.
*   **Gateway Software:**
    *   Data aggregation and analysis.
    *   Data visualization (web dashboard, mobile app).
    *   Alerting (based on sensor thresholds).
    *   Remote device management.
    *   API for integration with other systems.
*   **AI Integration:**
    *   Image recognition (plant health monitoring, object detection).
    *   Anomaly detection (identifying unusual sensor readings).
    *   Predictive modeling (forecasting environmental changes).

**Pseudocode – Anomaly Detection Algorithm:**

```
FUNCTION detectAnomaly(sensorData, historicalData):
  // Calculate rolling average of sensor data over a specified window
  rollingAverage = calculateRollingAverage(sensorData)

  // Calculate standard deviation of sensor data
  standardDeviation = calculateStandardDeviation(sensorData)

  // Calculate upper and lower bounds for anomaly detection
  upperBound = rollingAverage + (2 * standardDeviation)
  lowerBound = rollingAverage - (2 * standardDeviation)

  // Check if current sensor reading exceeds the bounds
  IF sensorData > upperBound OR sensorData < lowerBound:
    RETURN TRUE // Anomaly detected
  ELSE:
    RETURN FALSE // No anomaly detected
```

**Expansion – Bio-Integration:**

Explore incorporating bio-sensors into the “leaf” structure to detect plant stress levels (e.g., chlorophyll fluorescence, stem diameter variation). This could provide real-time feedback on plant health and environmental conditions, creating a symbiotic data network.
