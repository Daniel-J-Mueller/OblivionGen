## Dynamic Contextual Information Overlays – ‘Echoes’

**Concept:** Extend the idea of user-submitted information on related pages to create persistent, location-aware "Echoes" – digital remnants of past user interactions tied to physical locations or digital spaces.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Echo Server:** A central server managing Echo creation, storage, and retrieval.
*   **Client SDK:** Software Development Kit for integrating ‘Echo’ functionality into web/mobile applications.
*   **Geo-Spatial Database:** Database for storing Echo metadata including location coordinates, timestamps, user identifiers (anonymized or optional), and associated content.
*   **Content Moderation System:** Automatic and manual moderation tools to address inappropriate content.

**II. Functionality:**

1.  **Echo Creation:** Users can create ‘Echoes’ within an application. These Echoes contain text, images, audio, video, or links. Crucially, Echoes are linked to a specific location (GPS coordinates, address, URL, digital space identifier - e.g., a specific 3D model coordinate).
2.  **Echo Persistence:** Echoes are stored in the Geo-Spatial Database with timestamps. A decay function allows Echoes to fade over time (configurable per Echo or globally).
3.  **Proximity Detection:** When a user enters the proximity of an Echo (defined by a radius), the Client SDK triggers a notification.
4.  **Layered Visualization:**  Using Augmented Reality (AR) or a 2D map interface, Echoes are visualized as layers of information overlaid onto the real world or digital space. The visualization can be customized (icon type, color, size) based on Echo age, relevance, or user preferences.
5.  **Filtering & Discovery:** Users can filter Echoes based on age, content type, keywords, or user-defined categories.  A discovery mode allows users to explore nearby Echoes.
6. **'Resonance' feature:**  Echoes can be 'resonant' based on how many other Echoes are nearby.  More resonance means a more important or popular location.

**III. Pseudocode (Client SDK - Proximity Detection):**

```
FUNCTION onLocationUpdate(latitude, longitude):
    distance = calculateDistance(userLatitude, userLongitude, echoLatitude, echoLongitude)

    IF distance <= proximityRadius:
        displayEchoNotification(echoContent, echoTimestamp, echoAuthor)
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
    // Haversine formula or other distance calculation method
    // Returns distance in meters
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION displayEchoNotification(content, timestamp, author):
    // Display notification on screen/AR overlay
    // Highlight Echo on map
ENDFUNCTION
```

**IV. Potential Applications:**

*   **Hyperlocal Social Networking:** Users can leave "digital breadcrumbs" for friends and the community.
*   **Augmented Tourism:**  Historical information, user reviews, and hidden gems overlaid onto real-world landmarks.
*   **Gamified Exploration:** Create scavenger hunts and location-based challenges.
*   **Community Reporting:** Citizens can report issues (e.g., potholes, graffiti) with location data.
*   **Digital Memorials:**  Leave messages and memories at specific locations.
