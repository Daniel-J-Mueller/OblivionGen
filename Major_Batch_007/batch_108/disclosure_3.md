## Dynamic Memory Partitioning with Adaptive Encryption

**Concept:** Extend the obfuscation concept to dynamically partition virtual machine memory into security zones, each with its own encryption key and access control policies, adapting in real-time to application behavior.

**Specification:**

**1. Memory Partitioning Engine (MPE):**

*   **Function:** Responsible for dynamically dividing a VM’s memory space into isolated partitions.
*   **Input:** Application behavioral data (memory access patterns, data sensitivity classifications - optionally provided by the application or inferred).
*   **Output:** Partition map (defines boundaries and attributes of each partition).
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Initial Partitioning:** At VM startup, the MPE creates a base set of partitions based on pre-defined profiles (e.g., code, data, stack, heap).
    *   **Runtime Monitoring:** Monitors memory access patterns through hypervisor hooks.
    *   **Adaptive Partitioning:** Based on access patterns & sensitivity, dynamically merges, splits, or migrates memory regions between partitions. 
        *   If a region is frequently accessed and deemed low-sensitivity, it's moved to a less secure/faster partition.
        *   If a region is infrequently accessed but deemed high-sensitivity, it's moved to a more secure/slower partition.
        *   Regions exhibiting anomalous behavior (e.g., code execution in data regions) trigger isolation and heightened security measures.

**2. Adaptive Encryption Manager (AEM):**

*   **Function:** Manages encryption/decryption of individual memory partitions using unique symmetric keys.
*   **Input:** Partition map from MPE, key management requests.
*   **Output:** Encrypted/decrypted memory data.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Key Derivation:** Derives unique symmetric keys for each partition based on a master key and partition identifier.  Hardware-backed key storage (e.g., TPM) is strongly recommended.
    *   **Encryption/Decryption:**  Encrypts data written to partitions and decrypts data read from partitions using the corresponding key.
    *   **Granularity:** Encryption can be performed at the page level or finer granularity for optimal performance.
    *   **Key Rotation:** Periodically rotate encryption keys for enhanced security.

**3. Hypervisor Integration:**

*   **Memory Management Unit (MMU) Hooks:** The hypervisor intercepts MMU access requests to enforce partition boundaries and encryption policies.
*   **Page Table Modification:**  Page table entries are modified to map virtual addresses to encrypted memory regions and associated decryption keys.
*   **Exception Handling:**  Exceptions (e.g., invalid memory access) are handled to enforce security policies.

**4. API for Application Interaction (Optional):**

*   **Sensitivity Classification:**  An API allows the application to indicate the sensitivity of specific data regions, guiding the MPE’s partitioning decisions.
*   **Access Control:** An API allows the application to request access to specific data regions, subject to the MPE’s access control policies.

**Pseudocode (Hypervisor Hook - Memory Access):**

```
function handleMemoryAccess(virtualAddress, accessType, accessFlags):
  partitionId = getPartitionId(virtualAddress)
  key = getEncryptionKey(partitionId)
  if (accessType == READ):
    decryptedData = decrypt(virtualAddress, key)
    return decryptedData
  else if (accessType == WRITE):
    encryptedData = encrypt(virtualAddress, key)
    writeToMemory(encryptedData)
  
  // Check access control policies before allowing access
  if (checkAccessControl(virtualAddress, accessFlags)):
    return SUCCESS
  else:
    return ACCESS_DENIED
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   CPU with virtualization extensions (e.g., Intel VT-x, AMD-V).
*   Memory Management Unit (MMU) with support for page-level access control.
*   Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or equivalent for secure key storage.
*   AES-NI instruction set for accelerated encryption/decryption.
