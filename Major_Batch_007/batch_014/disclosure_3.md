## Dynamic Workflow "Shadowing" and Predictive Assistance

**Concept:** Extend the workflow assembly tool to support "shadowing" – real-time recording and analysis of a user's workflow creation process. This data is then used to provide predictive assistance, suggesting nodes and connections *before* the user explicitly initiates them. Think of it as an AI co-pilot for workflow design.

**Specs:**

**1. Shadowing Module:**

*   **Data Capture:**  Transparently record all user interactions within the workflow assembly tool. This includes:
    *   Node selections (icon clicks).
    *   Node placements (coordinates in the workflow assembly area).
    *   Connection creations (drag-and-drop, connector lines).
    *   Configuration changes within nodes (parameter adjustments).
    *   Timestamps for each action.
*   **Data Storage:**  Store collected data as a sequence of "workflow events." Events should be tagged with user ID (for personalized models) and potentially workflow metadata (e.g., workflow name, purpose). Data is stored locally or on a secure server.
*   **Privacy Controls:** Implement explicit user consent and data anonymization options.  Users should have the ability to disable shadowing entirely or selectively exclude certain workflows from analysis.

**2. Predictive Assistance Engine:**

*   **Model Training:** Utilize collected workflow event sequences to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to predict the next likely action given the current workflow state. The workflow state is represented as:
    *   A vector embedding of the existing nodes and their types.
    *   A representation of the current node placement area (e.g., coordinates).
    *   A historical record of recent actions.
*   **Prediction Generation:** Given the current workflow state, the LSTM network outputs a probability distribution over possible next actions:
    *   Node selection (probability for each node type).
    *   Node placement (predicted coordinates).
    *   Connection creation (predicted source and destination nodes).
*   **UI Integration:**
    *   **Ghost Nodes:**  Display faint, semi-transparent “ghost nodes” in the workflow assembly area, representing the most likely next nodes based on the prediction.
    *   **Smart Connectors:**  Highlight potential connection points between nodes with visual cues (e.g., animated lines) to suggest logical connections.
    *   **Node Recommendations:**  Present a ranked list of recommended nodes in a dedicated panel, alongside a confidence score for each recommendation.
    *   **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously refine the prediction model based on user feedback (e.g., if the user ignores a recommendation, reduce its future weight).

**3. Workflow Pattern Library Integration:**

*   **Pattern Extraction:** Analyze a large corpus of user-created workflows to identify common patterns and sub-workflows.
*   **Pattern Matching:**  When a user begins assembling a new workflow, the system identifies potential pattern matches based on the initial nodes and connections.
*   **Automated Sub-Workflow Insertion:**  Suggest the insertion of pre-built sub-workflows, allowing users to quickly incorporate complex logic with minimal effort.  These sub-workflows are presented as single, encapsulated nodes.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine):**

```python
# Input: current_workflow_state (vector embedding of nodes, recent actions)
# Output: probability distribution over next actions (node selection, placement)

def predict_next_action(current_workflow_state, lstm_model):
    # Pass current workflow state through LSTM model
    predicted_output = lstm_model.predict(current_workflow_state)

    # Normalize output to create probability distribution
    probabilities = softmax(predicted_output)

    return probabilities

def softmax(x):
    e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))
    return e_x / e_x.sum(axis=0)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Standard workstation with sufficient processing power and memory for training and running the LSTM model.
*   Cloud-based GPU instances may be used for model training and large-scale data analysis.
*   Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch for implementing the LSTM model.
*   Existing workflow assembly tool codebase.
