## Dynamic Parcel Redirection via Geofence & Scheduled Availability

**Concept:** Extend privacy & convenience beyond simply masking contact details. Allow purchasers to define a temporary "safe zone" (geofence) & preferred delivery window *after* the order is placed, dynamically redirecting the parcel to a trusted location *within* that zone if the primary address isn't viable at the time of delivery. This combines privacy with proactive delivery management.

**System Specs:**

*   **Mobile Application Integration:** User-facing app integrates with e-commerce platform.
*   **Geofence Definition:**  User defines a polygonal geofence on a map (e.g., their driveway, a neighbor's porch, a secure package locker location). Maximum size configurable by carrier (e.g., 50m radius).  Geofence coordinates stored securely.
*   **Availability Scheduling:**  User sets a time window (e.g., "between 2 PM and 5 PM today") within which delivery to the geofence is acceptable.  Multiple windows allowed.
*   **Real-time Location Tracking (Opt-In):** Parcel location tracked via carrier systems.  Privacy-focused tracking â€“ only active during the delivery window.
*   **Dynamic Redirection Logic:** If the delivery driver attempts delivery to the primary address *within* the delivery window and fails (e.g., no one home, access issues), the system *automatically* reroutes to the nearest viable point *within* the user-defined geofence.
*   **Viable Point Determination:** Algorithm identifies viable drop-off points within the geofence based on:
    *   GPS signal strength & accessibility for the driver.
    *   Pre-approved locations (e.g., porch, side door). User designates this in the app.
    *   Potential integration with smart lock/locker systems (future enhancement).
*   **Confirmation & Notification:** User receives a notification when the parcel is successfully delivered to the redirected location, with photo confirmation.
*   **API Integration:** Secure API integration with e-commerce platforms, carrier systems, and mapping services.

**Pseudocode (Redirection Logic):**

```
FUNCTION RedirectParcel(parcelID, currentDeliveryAddress, currentTime)

    IF currentTime > scheduledDeliveryStartTime AND currentTime < scheduledDeliveryEndTime THEN
        // Check if delivery attempt failed at primary address
        IF deliveryAttemptFailed(parcelID, currentDeliveryAddress) THEN
            // Get user's defined geofence
            geofence = GetGeofence(parcelID)
            
            // Find viable drop-off points within geofence
            viablePoints = FindViablePoints(geofence, parcelID)
            
            IF viablePoints IS NOT EMPTY THEN
                // Choose the best viable point (closest, accessible, etc.)
                bestPoint = ChooseBestPoint(viablePoints)
                
                // Update delivery address to bestPoint
                UpdateDeliveryAddress(parcelID, bestPoint)
                
                // Notify user of redirection & updated delivery location
                SendRedirectionNotification(parcelID, bestPoint)
                
                RETURN SUCCESS
            ELSE
                // No viable points found - revert to standard delivery process or contact user
                // (Error handling/fallback logic)
                RETURN FAILURE
            ENDIF
        ELSE
            // Delivery attempt not yet made or successful - continue with standard process
            RETURN CONTINUE
        ENDIF
    ELSE
        // Outside of scheduled delivery window - continue with standard process
        RETURN CONTINUE
    ENDIF
