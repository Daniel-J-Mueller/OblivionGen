## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Profiling & Adaptive Voice Command Sets

**Concept:** Extend voice control beyond simple parameter assignment by building continuously updated acoustic profiles of the operating environment and adapting available voice commands accordingly. This creates a more intuitive and context-aware voice experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing Voice-Capturing Device (as defined in patent)
*   Ambient Sound Sensor (integrated or external) - broad frequency response.
*   Edge Processing Unit - capable of real-time audio analysis (FFT, feature extraction).
*   Network Connectivity - for model updates and data logging (optional).

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Classifier:**  A machine learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN) trained on a diverse dataset of acoustic scenes (office, home, car, outdoors, etc.).  Model input: Feature vectors extracted from ambient sound sensor data.  Output: Probability distribution over predefined acoustic scene classes.
*   **Dynamic Command Set Manager:**  A rule-based system that maps acoustic scene classifications to sets of available voice commands.  Rules can be defined by the user or automatically learned.
*   **Voice Activity Detection (VAD):** Standard VAD algorithm to isolate user speech from background noise.
*   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Engine:** Parses user voice commands.
*   **Device Management Integration:** Leverages existing device management system to enable/disable commands based on context.

**3. Functional Description:**

1.  **Continuous Acoustic Monitoring:** The ambient sound sensor continuously monitors the environment.
2.  **Scene Classification:** The acoustic scene classifier analyzes the ambient sound data and identifies the current acoustic scene.
3.  **Command Set Adaptation:** The Dynamic Command Set Manager selects the appropriate set of voice commands based on the identified acoustic scene. For example:
    *   **Office:**  Commands related to scheduling, conferencing, document editing.
    *   **Car:**  Commands related to navigation, media control, phone calls.
    *   **Home:** Commands related to smart home devices, entertainment, information retrieval.
4.  **Voice Input & Processing:** The user issues a voice command.
5.  **VAD & NLU:** The VAD isolates the user speech, and the NLU engine parses the command.
6.  **Action Execution:** The appropriate action is executed based on the parsed command and the current context.

**4. Pseudocode (Dynamic Command Set Adaptation):**

```
FUNCTION UpdateCommandSet(acousticScene):
  // acousticScene is the output of the Acoustic Scene Classifier
  IF acousticScene == "Office":
    commandSet = ["Schedule Meeting", "Open Document", "Start Conference", "Send Email"]
  ELSE IF acousticScene == "Car":
    commandSet = ["Navigate Home", "Play Music", "Make Call", "Adjust Temperature"]
  ELSE IF acousticScene == "Home":
    commandSet = ["Turn On Lights", "Play TV", "Get News", "Lock Doors"]
  ELSE:
    commandSet = ["Help", "Repeat", "Cancel"] // Default command set

  // Update available commands in the Device Management System
  DeviceManagement.setAvailableCommands(commandSet)
END FUNCTION

// Main loop
WHILE True:
  acousticScene = AcousticSceneClassifier.classify()
  UpdateCommandSet(acousticScene)

  // Wait for voice input
  voiceInput = VoiceCaptureDevice.capture()

  // Process voice input
  // ...
END WHILE
```

**5.  Data Logging & Model Updates:**

*   Log ambient sound data and corresponding user actions.
*   Use this data to continuously retrain the acoustic scene classifier, improving its accuracy and generalization ability.
*   Implement over-the-air (OTA) updates to deploy new models and features.
