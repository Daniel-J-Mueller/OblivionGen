## Dynamic Root of Trust with Attestation Chain

**Concept:** Expand the on-chip key concept into a dynamic, multi-layered Root of Trust (RoT) managed by a hardware-based Attestation Chain. Instead of a single, static on-chip key, create a hierarchy where each layer derives its key from the layer below, culminating in a physically unclonable function (PUF) at the base. This allows for periodic key rotation and enhanced security against physical attacks.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **PUF Module:**  A silicon PUF generates a unique, unpredictable key based on inherent manufacturing variations. This is the foundation of the RoT.
*   **Hardware Security Module (HSM):** A dedicated, tamper-resistant chip.  Contains:
    *   PUF interface
    *   True Random Number Generator (TRNG)
    *   Key Derivation Function (KDF) engine (SHA-256 or better)
    *   Encryption/Decryption engines (AES-256, RSA-2048 or ECC equivalent)
    *   Secure storage for intermediate keys and attestation data.
*   **Secure Bootloader:**  Verifies the integrity of the initial boot code before execution.  Uses cryptographic signatures verified by the HSM.
*   **One-Time Programmable (OTP) Memory:** Small amount of OTP used to store a seed value for the TRNG and a limited set of initial configuration parameters.

**2. Key Derivation and Rotation:**

*   **Initial Key Generation:**
    1.  Seed the TRNG with the OTP value.
    2.  Generate a master key using the TRNG.
    3.  Use the PUF output as input to the KDF alongside the master key to derive a root key (RK).
*   **Key Hierarchy:**
    1.  RK derives a provisioning key (PK) using KDF.
    2.  PK derives a device secret key (DSK) for local encryption/decryption.
    3.  DSK derives keys for specific applications or data sets.
*   **Periodic Rotation:**  The HSM periodically rotates keys at each layer. The process is triggered by a timer or a security event.  Rotation involves generating new keys, encrypting sensitive data with the new keys, and securely deleting the old keys.

**3. Attestation Chain:**

*   **Measurement & Signing:** During boot, the HSM measures the integrity of each software component (bootloader, OS kernel, critical applications) by calculating a cryptographic hash.  This hash is then signed using the current RK.
*   **Remote Attestation:** The signed measurement is sent to a remote attestation server. The server verifies the signature using a known public key associated with the device.  Successful attestation confirms the deviceâ€™s software integrity.
*   **Chain of Trust:**  Each subsequent layer of software can verify the integrity of the layer below by verifying its signature. This creates a chain of trust from the hardware RoT to the running applications.

**4.  Integration with Secure Key Provisioning:**

*   The provisioning key (PK) generated by the HSM is used to encrypt secret material as described in the provided patent.
*   The HSM also manages the DSK, ensuring it is never directly exposed to the operating system or applications.
*   When new secret material needs to be provisioned, the remote server initiates the process by sending an encrypted request to the device.  The HSM decrypts the request, generates a new session key, encrypts the secret material, and sends it back to the server.

**5. Pseudocode (Key Rotation):**

```
// HSM Firmware

function rotateKeys() {
  // 1. Generate a new master key
  newMasterKey = TRNG.generateKey();

  // 2. Derive a new root key from the PUF and the new master key
  newRootKey = KDF(PUF.output(), newMasterKey);

  // 3. Derive a new provisioning key from the new root key
  newProvisioningKey = KDF(newRootKey, "provisioning_salt");

  // 4. Derive a new device secret key from the new provisioning key
  newDeviceSecretKey = KDF(newProvisioningKey, "device_salt");

  // 5. Encrypt all sensitive data with the new keys (provisioning key, secret material, etc.)

  // 6. Securely delete the old keys (overwrite memory multiple times)

  // 7. Update the key hierarchy in secure storage
}

// Timer interrupt handler
function timerInterrupt() {
  if (timerExpired()) {
    rotateKeys();
    resetTimer();
  }
}
```

**Innovation:** This design moves beyond a static key to a dynamic, self-healing Root of Trust.  The Attestation Chain provides verifiable proof of device integrity, and the periodic key rotation mitigates the risk of key compromise. This makes the system more resilient to both physical and logical attacks.
