**Distributed Temporal Data Streams with Predictive Indexing**

**Concept:** Leverage the snapshotting and indexing concepts within the provided patent to create a system for managing *temporal data streams*—data that changes over time—with proactive, predictive indexing. This isn't just about reading consistent versions of data; it's about anticipating *future* data needs based on stream behavior and pre-indexing that data before it's even requested.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Temporal Data Stream Interface:**
    *   Define a standard interface for ingesting data streams. Each data point must include a timestamp.
    *   Streams are identified by a unique stream ID.
    *   Data is partitioned across nodes.

2.  **Predictive Indexing Engine:**
    *   **Behavioral Analysis:** Monitor data stream patterns (frequency, cardinality, data types, trends). Utilize time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future data values and access patterns.
    *   **Index Creation:** Based on predicted access patterns, dynamically create secondary indexes *before* queries arrive. These indexes aren’t just on existing data, but on *predicted* data points.
    *   **Index Types:** Support multiple index types (B-trees, hash tables, bloom filters) and dynamically select the optimal type based on predicted data characteristics.
    *   **Index Versioning:** Maintain versions of indexes corresponding to different points in time. This allows queries to request data as it existed at a specific timestamp.

3.  **Snapshot Integration:**
    *   Integrate predictive indexes with the existing snapshotting mechanism.
    *   Snapshots should include metadata about the predictive indexes active at that point in time.
    *   Queries can leverage both snapshots *and* predictive indexes for faster access.

4.  **Query Processing:**
    *   **Timestamp Specification:** Allow queries to specify a target timestamp.
    *   **Index Selection:** The query planner automatically selects the optimal index (snapshot, predictive, or a combination) based on the target timestamp and query criteria.
    *   **Temporal Filtering:**  Implement temporal filtering to efficiently retrieve data within a specific time range.

5.  **Node Coordination:**
    *   **Index Distribution:** Distribute predictive indexes across nodes based on data partitioning.
    *   **Index Synchronization:**  Implement a synchronization mechanism to ensure that indexes are consistent across nodes.
    *   **Failure Handling:** Handle node failures gracefully and automatically rebuild indexes on other nodes.

**Pseudocode (Query Processing):**

```
function processQuery(query, timestamp) {
  index = selectOptimalIndex(query, timestamp)

  if (index == "snapshot") {
    data = readFromSnapshot(timestamp)
  } else if (index == "predictive") {
    data = readFromPredictiveIndex(query)
  } else { // "combined"
    snapshotData = readFromSnapshot(timestamp)
    predictedData = readFromPredictiveIndex(query)
    data = mergeData(snapshotData, predictedData)
  }
  return filterData(data, query)
}

function selectOptimalIndex(query, timestamp) {
  // Analyze query and timestamp
  // Consider data characteristics and predicted access patterns
  // Return "snapshot", "predictive", or "combined"
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Financial markets (high-frequency trading)
*   IoT sensor data analysis
*   Real-time fraud detection
*   Network monitoring
*   Game development (real-time world state)
