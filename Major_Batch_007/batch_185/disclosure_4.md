## Acoustic Mapping & Environmental Reconstruction

**Concept:** Leverage the ultrasonic positioning system to create dynamic, real-time 3D acoustic maps of indoor environments, and reconstruct environmental events based on detected sound reflections.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing ultrasonic emitter/receiver array (as per the provided patent) – enhanced with increased density and wider frequency range (20Hz – 200kHz).
    *   High-sensitivity MEMS microphones integrated *within* the ultrasonic receiver array – capturing ambient audio.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – providing device orientation and movement data.
    *   Dedicated processing unit (FPGA or similar) for real-time signal processing.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **Phase Shift Mapping:** Analyze phase shifts in received ultrasonic signals to build a point cloud representation of surfaces within the environment.  This will not be just for positioning, but *mapping* the room.
    *   **Acoustic Reflection Analysis:** Analyze the time delay and amplitude of reflected sound waves captured by the MEMS microphones.  Differentiate between direct sound and reflections.
    *   **Ray Tracing Integration:** Combine ultrasonic mapping data with acoustic reflection data to perform real-time ray tracing. This visualizes how sound propagates and reflects.
    *   **Event Reconstruction:** Log and analyze sound events (e.g., a dropped object, a door slam). Reconstruct the event by combining the location data (from the ultrasonic system) with the acoustic signature.  Algorithm to categorize sounds ("glass breaking", "human speech", "impact").
    *   **Dynamic Mapping Updates:** Continuous updates to the map, to account for temporary or permanent changes to the environment.
    *   **Data Storage:** Secure onboard storage for raw data and reconstructed events.  Ability to stream data to a central server.

**Pseudocode (Event Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructEvent(eventData):
  // eventData contains timestamps, acoustic signatures, and ultrasonic positions
  
  // Filter eventData based on acoustic signature (e.g., "glass breaking")
  filteredEvents = filterEvents(eventData, acousticSignature = "glass breaking")

  // For each filtered event:
  for each event in filteredEvents:
    // Get event timestamp and ultrasonic position data
    timestamp = event.timestamp
    positionData = event.positionData

    // Use ultrasonic data to pinpoint the source location
    sourceLocation = calculateSourceLocation(positionData)

    // Reconstruct the event as a 3D point cloud centered around sourceLocation.
    reconstructedEvent = createPointCloud(sourceLocation, timestamp)

    // Display the reconstructed event in real-time.
    displayEvent(reconstructedEvent)
  end for
end function

function calculateSourceLocation(positionData):
    // Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) calculations using the ultrasonic data
    //  Triangulate the source location based on TDOA values from multiple receivers
    // Return the estimated 3D coordinates of the sound source
end function

function createPointCloud(sourceLocation, timestamp):
    // Generate a 3D point cloud visualization of the event
    // Use the timestamp to represent the event's duration
    // Adjust the point cloud's color and density based on the event's intensity
end function
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Security Systems:** Detect and locate intruders based on sound.
*   **Smart Homes:** Automatic environmental mapping and device location.
*   **Industrial Monitoring:** Detect equipment malfunctions based on sound signatures.
*   **Forensic Analysis:** Reconstruct crime scenes based on sound events.
*   **Accessibility:** Assist visually impaired individuals by providing auditory environmental mapping.
