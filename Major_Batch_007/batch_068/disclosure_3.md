## Adaptive Granularity Routing with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Expand the hierarchical routing concept by introducing dynamically adjustable granularity of address assignment *and* integrating a predictive prefetching mechanism for forwarding information.  This aims to reduce latency and improve resource utilization, especially in high-churn network environments.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dynamic Granularity Adjustment Module (DGAM):**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors network traffic patterns for each assigned address range (portion of the network address format).  Adjusts the granularity of address assignment based on observed traffic density.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   Traffic Density = (Packets Received for Address Range) / (Time Window)
    *   If Traffic Density > Threshold_High: Split the assigned address range into smaller sub-ranges. Assign these sub-ranges to separate routers.
    *   If Traffic Density < Threshold_Low: Merge adjacent address ranges. Re-assign the combined range to a single router.
    *   The time window and thresholds are configurable parameters.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   Address Range Tree:  A hierarchical tree representing the current address range assignments. Each node contains the address range, the assigned router ID, and traffic statistics.
    *   Router Load Table:  Tracks the current load (packet processing rate, memory usage) of each router.

**2. Predictive Forwarding Information Prefetch Module (PFIPM):**

*   **Function:** Analyzes historical routing patterns to *predict* future forwarding information requirements. Prefetches this information to routers before it is actually needed, reducing lookup latency.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   Maintain a routing pattern history database.
    *   Use a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) to predict the probability of a given destination address being accessed by a router.
    *   Prefetch the corresponding forwarding information (FIB entries) for addresses with a high probability.
    *   Use a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache to manage pre-fetched information.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   Routing Pattern History Database: Stores historical routing data (source/destination addresses, timestamps).
    *   Prediction Model:  A trained machine learning model for predicting future routing patterns.
    *   Prefetch Cache:  A cache for storing pre-fetched FIB entries.

**3.  Integration with Existing Routing Hierarchy:**

*   The DGAM and PFIPM modules are implemented as components within the existing routing management component.
*   The DGAM module dynamically updates the Address Range Tree, informing routers of address range changes.
*   The PFIPM module proactively distributes FIB entries to routers based on predicted traffic patterns.
*   Routers maintain both a standard FIB and a prefetch cache.  The prefetch cache is consulted before the standard FIB, reducing lookup latency.

**Pseudocode (PFIPM - Key Function):**

```pseudocode
function predict_and_prefetch(router_id):
  routing_history = get_routing_history(router_id)
  predicted_destinations = predict_destinations(routing_history) //Using ML model
  for destination in predicted_destinations:
    if destination not in router.prefetch_cache:
      fib_entry = get_fib_entry(destination)
      router.prefetch_cache.add(destination, fib_entry)
      //Optional: Prioritize fetching based on prediction confidence score
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased memory capacity on routers to accommodate prefetch cache.
*   Faster interconnect between routers to support rapid distribution of forwarding information.
*   Dedicated hardware acceleration for machine learning inference (e.g., for the prediction model).
