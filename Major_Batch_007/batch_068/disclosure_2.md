**Adaptive Network Slice ‘Chaining’ for Multi-Application Prioritization**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the existing network slicing concept to allow *dynamic chaining* of slices, prioritizing data streams *across* multiple applications simultaneously, adapting to real-time application needs and user-defined policies. This differs from simply allocating slices *to* applications; it’s about creating a prioritized data *flow* through a series of interconnected slices.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Application Profiler:** (Software component within each application).  Continuously monitors application data characteristics: bandwidth usage, latency sensitivity, data type (video, audio, text, control signals), and priority level (user-defined or auto-assigned).
*   **Slice Orchestrator:** (Centralized or Distributed Service).  Receives application profiles, manages slice creation/modification/deletion, and *chains* slices together based on defined policies and real-time demand. The key is the orchestrator doesn't just *allocate* resources, it dynamically *routes* data through the most appropriate chain of slices.
*   **Dynamic Routing Engine (DRE):** (Software/Hardware component within network infrastructure – e.g., base stations, core network routers). Implements the data routing logic dictated by the Slice Orchestrator.  The DRE inspects packet headers to identify the application and slice chain, then forwards the data accordingly.
*   **Slice ‘Connectors’:**  (Software/Hardware components). These establish the pathways between slices, enabling seamless data transfer. They handle any necessary protocol conversions or data transformations.

**III. Operational Flow (Pseudocode):**

```
// Application Profiler (runs within each app)
loop:
  monitorDataCharacteristics()
  determinePriorityLevel()
  sendProfileToSliceOrchestrator()
end loop

// Slice Orchestrator
onReceiveProfile(profile):
  applicationID = profile.applicationID
  priority = profile.priority
  dataCharacteristics = profile.dataCharacteristics

  // Determine optimal slice chain based on priority and characteristics
  sliceChain = findOptimalSliceChain(applicationID, priority, dataCharacteristics)

  // Update Dynamic Routing Engine with new routing rules
  updateDRE(applicationID, sliceChain)
end

// Dynamic Routing Engine
onReceivePacket(packet):
  applicationID = packet.applicationID
  sliceChain = getSliceChain(applicationID)

  if sliceChain exists:
    routePacketThroughSliceChain(packet, sliceChain)
  else:
    // Default routing (e.g., standard network connection)
    routePacketThroughDefaultConnection(packet)
end
```

**IV.  Slice Chain Definition:**

A slice chain is an ordered list of network slices. Each slice in the chain can have different Quality of Service (QoS) parameters (bandwidth, latency, packet loss).  The chain is designed to optimize data delivery for a specific application or a set of applications. For example:

*   Slice 1: Low latency, high bandwidth (for real-time video)
*   Slice 2: Medium latency, medium bandwidth (for background data transfer)
*   Slice 3: High latency, low bandwidth (for non-critical control signals)

**V.  Dynamic Adaptation:**

The system continuously monitors network conditions and application demands.  If conditions change (e.g., network congestion, increased application load), the Slice Orchestrator can dynamically:

*   Re-route traffic to a different slice chain.
*   Modify the QoS parameters of existing slices.
*   Create new slices or delete unused slices.

**VI. Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Autonomous Vehicles:** Prioritize safety-critical data (sensor data, emergency alerts) over infotainment data.
*   **AR/VR Gaming:**  Ensure low latency and high bandwidth for immersive gaming experiences.
*   **Industrial Automation:**  Prioritize control signals over monitoring data.
*   **Emergency Services:**  Prioritize communication channels for first responders.
