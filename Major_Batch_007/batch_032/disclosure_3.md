## Multi-Leader Replica Conflict Resolution via Probabilistic Timestamps

**Concept:** Enhance conflict resolution in multi-leader replica systems by introducing probabilistic timestamps alongside traditional timestamps. This allows the system to factor in the *likelihood* of a timestamp being accurate, improving consistency beyond last-write-wins.

**Specification:**

**1. Timestamp Generation:**

*   Each replica generates a traditional timestamp (`ts`) for every write operation.
*   Each replica *also* generates a probabilistic confidence score (`pc`) associated with the timestamp. `pc` is a value between 0 and 1, representing the replica’s confidence in the timestamp’s accuracy.  Factors influencing `pc` include:
    *   **Clock Synchronization:** If the replica’s clock is known to be significantly skewed relative to other replicas (determined via NTP or similar), `pc` is lowered.
    *   **Network Latency:** Higher measured network latency between the replica and the primary/other replicas lowers `pc`.
    *   **Replica Load:** Higher replica load (CPU, I/O) decreases `pc` as timestamp generation becomes less precise.
    *   **Hardware/Software Clock Drift:** Estimation of clock drift over time, integrated into `pc` calculation.

**2. Conflict Detection and Resolution:**

*   When a new write arrives at a replica, it's compared to existing data. If a conflict is detected (same key, different value), the following process occurs:
*   **Weighted Timestamp Comparison:**  Instead of simple timestamp comparison, a weighted score is calculated for each conflicting version: `score = ts + (pc * weight_factor)`.  `weight_factor` is a tunable parameter controlling the influence of the confidence score.
*   **Version Selection:** The version with the highest weighted score is selected as the winner. This effectively prioritizes versions from replicas with higher confidence in their timestamps.
*   **Conflict Logging:**  All conflicts, including weighted scores and contributing factors, are logged for monitoring and analysis.

**3. System Components:**

*   **Timestamp Generator Module:**  Resides within each replica. Responsible for generating both `ts` and `pc`.
*   **Conflict Resolution Module:**  Resides within each replica. Implements the weighted timestamp comparison and version selection logic.
*   **Monitoring & Analytics Dashboard:** Visualizes conflict rates, `pc` distributions, and the impact of the `weight_factor` on conflict resolution.

**Pseudocode (Conflict Resolution Module):**

```
function resolveConflict(key, newVersion, existingVersions) {
  highestScore = -1
  winningVersion = null

  for each version in existingVersions {
    score = version.timestamp + (version.confidence * weightFactor)

    if (score > highestScore) {
      highestScore = score
      winningVersion = version
    }
  }

  newScore = newVersion.timestamp + (newVersion.confidence * weightFactor)

  if (newScore > highestScore) {
    winningVersion = newVersion
  }

  // Return winning version or apply update.
  return winningVersion
}
```

**Tunable Parameters:**

*   `weight_factor`: Controls the impact of the confidence score.
*   `pc_threshold`: Minimum confidence score to be considered valid.
*   Clock synchronization frequency/tolerance.
