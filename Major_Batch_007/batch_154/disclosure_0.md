## Adaptive Visualization Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the visualization system to dynamically adjust the level of detail displayed based on user interaction and system load. Instead of a fixed representation of user paths, the system would offer progressive disclosure, starting with a high-level overview and allowing users to "zoom in" to specific segments and timeframes with increasing detail.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `VisualizationLayer` : Abstract class defining the base structure for each layer of detail. Contains:
    *   `data_source`: Pointer to a data source object (see #2).
    *   `render_function`: Function pointer for rendering the layer.
    *   `level_of_detail`: Integer representing the detail level (0-highest, increasing numbers = lower detail).
*   `DataSource`: Abstract class for accessing path records. Methods:
    *   `get_path_record(object_id, start_time, end_time, detail_level)`: Returns a simplified or full path record.
*   `PathRecord`: Data structure to hold object transition data. Contains:
    *   `object_id`: Unique identifier for the client device.
    *   `timestamps`: List of timestamps indicating state transitions.
    *   `states`: List of corresponding states (files accessed).
    *   `original_data`: Pointer to the complete, raw data.

**2. System Components:**

*   **Granularity Manager:**  Responsible for managing the different visualization layers and dynamically adjusting the level of detail based on user interaction and system load.
    *   `request_visualization_data(object_id, start_time, end_time, zoom_level)`:  Returns a `VisualizationLayer` object for the requested zoom level.
    *   `adjust_granularity(system_load, user_interaction)`:  Dynamically adjusts the default level of detail for all visualizations based on system load and user interaction.  (Higher load/low interaction = lower detail).
*   **Visualization Engine:**  Receives `VisualizationLayer` objects and renders them.
*   **User Interface:** Allows users to interact with the visualization, including:
    *   Zooming in/out to adjust detail.
    *   Selecting specific objects or timeframes.
    *   Filtering data based on criteria.

**3. Pseudocode for `request_visualization_data`:**

```pseudocode
function request_visualization_data(object_id, start_time, end_time, zoom_level):
    // Determine the appropriate detail level based on zoom_level.
    detail_level = calculate_detail_level(zoom_level)

    // Access data source for the object.
    data_source = get_data_source(object_id)

    // Retrieve the path record at the specified detail level.
    path_record = data_source.get_path_record(object_id, start_time, end_time, detail_level)

    // Create a visualization layer.
    visualization_layer = new VisualizationLayer()
    visualization_layer.data_source = data_source
    visualization_layer.render_function = generate_render_function(path_record)  // Function to render the specific path
    visualization_layer.level_of_detail = detail_level

    return visualization_layer
```

**4. Render Function Generation:**

The `generate_render_function` function would dynamically create the rendering logic based on the `path_record`. This function would handle simplification of paths, aggregation of states, and dynamic adjustment of visual elements (e.g., color, size, opacity) to effectively communicate the information at the chosen level of detail.

**5. Adaptive Simplification Algorithm:**

Implement a simplification algorithm (e.g., Ramer–Douglas–Peucker) to reduce the number of points used to represent the object's path at lower detail levels.  This will improve performance and reduce visual clutter.

**6. Future Enhancements:**

*   **Predictive Visualization:** Use machine learning to predict future object transitions and pre-render visualizations for frequently accessed states.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Integrate external data sources (e.g., network latency, server load) to dynamically adjust the visualization and highlight potential performance bottlenecks.
*   **Collaborative Visualization:** Enable multiple users to interact with the same visualization and share insights.
