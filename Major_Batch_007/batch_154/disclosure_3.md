## Adaptive Multi-Band RF Harvesting & Power Distribution

**Concept:** Supplement transceiver power via ambient RF energy harvesting, dynamically allocating harvested power based on data packet type and estimated link quality.

**Specs:**

*   **RF Harvesting Module:**
    *   Frequency Range: 700 MHz – 6 GHz (covers common cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth bands).
    *   Antenna Array: 4x4 MIMO antenna array for spatial diversity and increased harvest efficiency. Beamforming capabilities.
    *   Rectifier Circuit: Multi-band rectifier circuit utilizing Schottky diodes and impedance matching networks optimized for each frequency band.
    *   DC-DC Converter: High-efficiency DC-DC converter to step up harvested voltage to a usable level (3.3V – 5V).
    *   Maximum Harvested Power: Target 50mW – 100mW (dependent on ambient RF signal strength).
*   **Power Management Unit (PMU):**
    *   Input: Harvested RF Power, Battery (optional, for buffering/peak demand).
    *   Output: Variable voltage/current to transceiver modules (PAN receiver, CPU, etc.).
    *   Control Logic: Microcontroller-based with algorithms for dynamic power allocation.
    *   Monitoring: Voltage, current, power monitoring on both input & output channels.
*   **Transceiver Integration:**
    *   Packet Type Detection: CPU analyzes packet header to determine packet type (BR, EDR).
    *   Link Quality Estimation: CPU estimates link quality based on RSSI, packet error rate, and signal-to-noise ratio.
    *   Power Allocation Algorithm:
        *   BR Packets: Minimum power allocation. Utilize harvested energy first.
        *   EDR Packets: Increased power allocation. Prioritize harvested energy. Supplement with battery if needed.
        *   Low Link Quality: Maximize power allocation, prioritize harvested energy & battery.
        *   High Link Quality: Reduce power allocation, rely primarily on harvested energy.
    *   Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS): Adjust transceiver operating voltage based on power allocation.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   RF Harvesting Module integrated directly onto PCB alongside transceiver modules.
    *   PMU located centrally to distribute power efficiently.
    *   Software control implemented in CPU.

**Pseudocode (Power Allocation Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION AllocatePower(PacketType, LinkQuality, HarvestedPower, BatteryLevel)
    IF PacketType == "BR" THEN
        TargetPower = MINIMUM_BR_POWER
    ELSE IF PacketType == "EDR" THEN
        TargetPower = STANDARD_EDR_POWER
    END IF

    IF LinkQuality < THRESHOLD_LOW THEN
        TargetPower = MAXIMUM_POWER
    ELSE IF LinkQuality > THRESHOLD_HIGH THEN
        TargetPower = MINIMUM_POWER
    END IF

    AvailablePower = HarvestedPower + BatteryPower

    IF AvailablePower < TargetPower THEN
        PowerToTransceiver = AvailablePower
        BatteryDepletion = TargetPower - PowerToTransceiver
        //Consider optional signal to reduce data rate, or switch to BR.
    ELSE
        PowerToTransceiver = TargetPower
    END IF

    RETURN PowerToTransceiver
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This shifts beyond solely optimizing *internal* power consumption and actively *sources* supplemental power from the RF environment, intelligently allocating it based on data needs and link conditions. It moves beyond low power modes, by augmenting power, rather than conserving it.
