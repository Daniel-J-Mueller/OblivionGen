## Dynamic Difficulty & Reward System for Interactive Fiction

**Concept:** Extend the viewer credit system to dynamically adjust the “difficulty” (content complexity/length of preview) of interactive fiction based on user engagement *and* reward them with credits based on the quality of their choices.

**Specs:**

*   **Content Library:** A library of interactive fiction works, segmented into “nodes” representing branching story points. Each node contains text/visual content *and* associated choice options.
*   **Engagement Metric:** A system to track user interaction beyond simple selection. This includes:
    *   **Read Time per Node:** How long the user spends on each story segment.
    *   **Choice Deliberation Time:** How long the user takes to choose an option.
    *   **'Rewind' Requests:** Option to revisit prior nodes (indicates uncertainty/dissatisfaction).
    *   **Sentiment Analysis (Optional):** Analyzing user input if the interactive fiction allows for text-based choices.
*   **Difficulty Adjustment:** Algorithm to dynamically adjust the length/complexity of preview nodes delivered to the user based on their engagement metric.
    *   **High Engagement:** Deliver longer, more complex nodes, potentially unlocking 'hidden' content paths.
    *   **Low Engagement:** Deliver shorter, simpler nodes, potentially streamlining the story or offering hints.
*   **Reward System:** Algorithm to award viewer credits based on the *quality* of the user's choices within the interactive fiction.
    *   **'Optimal Path' Identification:**  Pre-define (by author) ‘optimal’ or ‘highly-rated’ choice paths within the story.
    *   **Choice Alignment:** Award credits when the user's choice aligns with the optimal path.  Award a smaller amount of credits for ‘acceptable’ but sub-optimal choices.
    *   **'Critical Path' Bonus:**  Award larger bonuses for reaching key story milestones along the optimal path.
*   **Credit Conversion:**  Allow users to convert earned credits to unlock full access to the interactive fiction work, or to access other premium content.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
FUNCTION deliver_node(user_id, work_id, current_node_id):

    user_engagement = calculate_engagement(user_id)
    node = select_node(work_id, current_node_id, user_engagement) // Adjusts node length/complexity
    viewer_credit_value = calculate_credit_value(node)

    IF user has sufficient credits:
        deliver content to user
        deduct credits from user account
    ELSE:
        notify user of insufficient credits

    //Reward user for choices
    choice = user.make_choice(node.choices)
    reward = evaluate_choice(choice, node.optimal_path)
    user.add_credits(reward)

    return next_node_id //Based on user's choice.

FUNCTION evaluate_choice(user_choice, optimal_path):

    IF user_choice == optimal_path:
        return HIGH_REWARD
    ELSE IF user_choice is a valid but sub-optimal choice:
        return MEDIUM_REWARD
    ELSE:
        return LOW_REWARD
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Personalized Story Generation:** Use AI to generate new story branches or content based on user choices and engagement.
*   **Social Integration:** Allow users to share their story paths and achievements with friends.
*   **Gamification:** Incorporate challenges, achievements, and leaderboards to further incentivize engagement.
