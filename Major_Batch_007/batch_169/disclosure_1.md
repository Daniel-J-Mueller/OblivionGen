## Adaptive Resonance Container Handling – Specification v0.1

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the robotic drive unit concept by integrating bio-inspired resonant frequency manipulation for container handling. Instead of purely mechanical pushing/pulling, the system uses localized, focused acoustic resonance to *lift* and move containers. This minimizes physical contact, allows for handling of fragile or irregularly shaped items, and dramatically increases speed and precision.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Resonance Emitters (REs):**  An array of high-frequency piezoelectric transducers mounted on the robotic drive unit’s container mover arm. Each RE is individually addressable and can generate a focused ultrasonic beam. The array allows for dynamic shaping of the acoustic field. Minimum 16 REs, operating in the 40-80 kHz range.

2.  **Container Resonance Profiler (CRP):** A short-range laser vibrometer and acoustic sensor suite integrated with the REs. The CRP rapidly scans the container to determine its resonant frequencies and structural characteristics.  Data is used to construct a ‘resonance map’ of the container.

3.  **Adaptive Resonance Controller (ARC):**  A dedicated processing unit (FPGA-based) responsible for managing the RE array and CRP.  The ARC executes algorithms to calculate the optimal frequencies and amplitudes for each RE to levitate and manipulate the container.

4.  **Force Feedback System:** Highly sensitive MEMS accelerometers integrated into the container mover arm. These provide real-time feedback on the forces exerted on the container during levitation and movement. 

5.  **Material Database:** A continuously updated database storing resonant profiles of common container materials (plastic, cardboard, metal) and dimensions. Used for initial resonance predictions, minimizing CRP scan time.

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  **Approach & Identification:** Robotic drive unit positions the container mover arm proximate to the target container.  The system identifies the container type (if known) via visual recognition or RFID tag.
2.  **Resonance Profiling (CRP Scan):**  The CRP rapidly scans the container to map its resonant frequencies.  This data is used to refine the initial resonance prediction from the Material Database.
3.  **Levitation Initiation:** The ARC activates the RE array, generating an acoustic field that matches the container's resonant frequency. The container begins to levitate slightly.
4.  **Dynamic Manipulation:**  The ARC dynamically adjusts the frequency and amplitude of each RE to precisely control the container’s position and orientation.  This allows for smooth, stable lifting and movement without physical contact. The Force Feedback System ensures stable manipulation.
5.  **Transfer & Placement:**  The container is moved to the receptacle in the carrier rack. The ARC lowers the container into the receptacle while maintaining resonant lift until fully seated.
6.  **Resonance Disengagement:** The RE array is deactivated.

**Pseudocode (ARC Control Loop):**

```
loop:
    get container data (from CRP)
    calculate optimal RE frequencies & amplitudes
    set RE array output
    get force feedback data
    adjust RE output based on feedback
    check container position/orientation
    if container in receptacle:
        disengage resonance
        break
    end if
end loop
```

**Power Requirements:** 

*   High-frequency power amplifier for RE array (peak 500W).
*   Dedicated power supply for ARC (FPGA, sensors, amplifiers).
*   Integrated with existing robotic drive unit power system.

**Safety Considerations:**

*   Acoustic shielding around RE array to minimize noise pollution.
*   Automatic power-down if acoustic field is disrupted or exceeds safety limits.
*   Emergency stop mechanism to immediately disable the RE array.
*   Sensor checks to confirm container is secured before transport.
