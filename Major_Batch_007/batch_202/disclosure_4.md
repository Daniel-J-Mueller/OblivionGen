## Dynamic Procedural Detail Generation

**Concept:** Extend the real-time video exploration system to *procedurally* generate detail on objects when a user focuses on them, beyond what's present in the original video's graphics data. This detail isn't pre-baked; it's created on-demand, effectively 'filling in' missing information and adding a layer of visual fidelity responsive to user interaction.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Object Feature Mapping:**  The system needs a database linking object types (identified during scene analysis) to potential procedural detail generation algorithms.  Example: A ‘car’ object maps to algorithms for generating tire treads, detailed engine components visible through a window, reflections with varying roughness, and simulated wear/damage.

2.  **Detail Level Scaling:** A ‘Detail Level’ (DL) parameter, tied to client device capabilities *and* user preference, controls the complexity of the procedural generation.  DL ranges from 0 (no procedural generation, uses only source video detail) to, for example, 5 (maximum detail, computationally intensive).

3.  **Procedural Generation Modules:**
    *   **Texture Synthesis:**  Algorithms (e.g., PatchMatch, exemplar-based synthesis) generate high-resolution textures on-demand, based on a small sample texture from the original video and/or from the object feature mapping database.
    *   **Geometry Generation:**  Algorithms (e.g., subdivision surfaces, displacement mapping) generate additional geometric detail.  This could include adding small imperfections, surface roughness, or even entirely new components.
    *   **Material Property Generation:**  Algorithms generate Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material properties (roughness, metallic, specular) based on the object type and environment.
    *   **Dynamic Micro-Displacement:**  Implement a system where micro-displacements are calculated on surfaces in real-time based on simulated physics (e.g., wind, vibrations).

4.  **Interaction-Driven Detail Focus:** When the user focuses (through gaze tracking, mouse cursor, or explicit selection) on an object, the system:
    *   Prioritizes procedural detail generation for that object.
    *   Increases the DL for that object, potentially exceeding the global DL if processing power allows.
    *   Focuses detail generation on the area the user is directly viewing.  (Raytracing/Rasterization based priority).

5. **Streaming Protocol Integration:**  The system streams the procedurally generated detail as a separate data stream alongside the original video.  This allows for dynamic adjustment of the DL based on network bandwidth and client device capabilities.  A compression algorithm optimized for procedural geometry and textures is necessary.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function OnUserFocus(objectID, focusArea):
  object = GetObject(objectID)

  if object == null:
    return

  targetDL = GetUserPreferredDetailLevel() + FocusBonus

  if targetDL > MaxDetailLevel:
    targetDL = MaxDetailLevel

  if targetDL > DeviceMaxDetailLevel:
    targetDL = DeviceMaxDetailLevel

  GenerateProceduralDetails(object, targetDL, focusArea)

function GenerateProceduralDetails(object, detailLevel, focusArea):
  // 1. Load object's base geometry and textures
  baseGeometry = LoadGeometry(object.geometryPath)
  baseTexture = LoadTexture(object.texturePath)

  // 2. Get procedural generation algorithms for object type
  algorithms = GetProceduralAlgorithms(object.type)

  // 3. Apply algorithms based on detailLevel and focusArea
  proceduralGeometry = algorithms.GenerateGeometry(baseGeometry, detailLevel, focusArea)
  proceduralTexture = algorithms.GenerateTexture(baseTexture, detailLevel, focusArea)
  proceduralMaterials = algorithms.GenerateMaterials(detailLevel)

  // 4. Blend procedural and base data
  finalGeometry = BlendGeometry(baseGeometry, proceduralGeometry)
  finalTexture = BlendTexture(baseTexture, proceduralTexture)
  finalMaterials = BlendMaterials(baseMaterials, proceduralMaterials)

  // 5. Stream final data to client
  StreamData(finalGeometry, finalTexture, finalMaterials)
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Driven Detail Generation:**  Utilize machine learning models to predict missing details based on the object type, environment, and user viewing angle.
*   **Collaborative Detail Generation:** Allow multiple users to contribute to the detail generation process, creating a shared, dynamic environment.
*   **Real-Time Damage/Wear Simulation:** Incorporate physics-based simulations to create realistic damage and wear effects on objects.
