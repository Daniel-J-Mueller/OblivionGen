## Personalized Content "Echo" System

**Concept:** Extend the adverse content detection to proactively *mirror* a user's browsing experience on a safe, isolated environment to identify potential risks *before* exposure, and offer curated alternative content.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Core Component:** "Echo Engine" - A virtualized browsing environment mirroring the user's primary browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) with identical extensions, cookies (anonymized/hashed), and user agent string.
*   **Traffic Interception:**  A lightweight proxy (running on client or edge server) intercepts all outgoing HTTP/HTTPS requests from the user’s primary browser.
*   **Request Duplication:** The proxy duplicates each intercepted request and forwards it *both* to the original destination *and* to the Echo Engine.
*   **Echo Engine Rendering:**  The Echo Engine renders the content from the destination URL in a headless manner (no visible browser window).
*   **Risk Analysis Module:** A module within the Echo Engine analyzes the rendered content for:
    *   Known malicious patterns (malware, phishing).
    *   Content matching reported adverse content events (similar to existing patent).
    *   Sentiment analysis - detects potentially harmful or upsetting content.
    *   Visual threat detection - scans for inappropriate images or videos.
*   **Alternative Content Database:**  A database of curated, safe alternative content (articles, videos, images) mapped to relevant topics and keywords.

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  User requests a web page (e.g., `www.example.com`).
2.  Request is intercepted by the proxy.
3.  Proxy duplicates the request and sends both copies.
4.  User's browser receives the content directly.
5.  Echo Engine receives the content, renders it, and the Risk Analysis Module scans it.
6.  **If risk detected:**
    *   A non-intrusive notification is presented to the user *before* the page fully loads: “We’ve detected potentially concerning content on this page. Would you like to see a curated alternative?”
    *   User can choose to proceed to the original page or view the alternative.
7.  **If no risk detected:** No notification is presented, and the browsing experience continues uninterrupted.

**3. Data Handling:**

*   **Privacy Focus:** All data within the Echo Engine is anonymized and isolated. No personal user data is stored or transmitted.
*   **Content Hashing:**  Rendered content is hashed for rapid risk assessment.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  The Risk Analysis Module learns from user feedback and reported adverse events to improve accuracy.

**4. Pseudocode (Risk Analysis Module):**

```pseudocode
function analyzeContent(renderedContent, URL):
    riskScore = 0

    // Check against known malicious patterns
    if isMalicious(renderedContent):
        riskScore += 100

    // Check against reported adverse content events
    if isAdverseContent(renderedContent):
        riskScore += 50

    // Perform sentiment analysis
    sentimentScore = analyzeSentiment(renderedContent)
    if sentimentScore < -0.5: // Negative sentiment
        riskScore += 20

    // Perform visual threat detection
    visualThreatScore = detectVisualThreats(renderedContent)
    if visualThreatScore > 0.7: // High probability of inappropriate visuals
        riskScore += 30

    // Determine risk level
    if riskScore > 50:
        return "High Risk"
    else if riskScore > 20:
        return "Medium Risk"
    else:
        return "Low Risk"
```

**5. Engineer Considerations:**

*   Performance optimization is critical.  The Echo Engine must render pages quickly without impacting the user's browsing experience.
*   Scalability is essential. The system must be able to handle a large volume of requests.
*   Browser compatibility is important. The Echo Engine must accurately render pages across different browsers and operating systems.
*   The system should leverage existing anti-malware and anti-phishing databases.
