## Adaptive Network "Shadowing" for Device Onboarding

**Concept:** Expand the confidence-based provisioning to incorporate a dynamic "shadow network" creation. Instead of solely focusing on authorization for *the* network, temporarily create a miniature, isolated network for the onboarding device to assess compatibility & functionality *before* full integration.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires a network access point (NAP) capable of dynamically allocating VLANs/subnets or utilizing software-defined networking (SDN) principles.  A secondary, low-power radio module within the onboarding device (optional, for enhanced testing).

*   **Software – NAP Side:**
    *   `Receive_ProbeRequest(ProbeRequestData)`:  Standard function to receive probe requests. Initiates confidence scoring process (as per the base patent).
    *   `Create_ShadowNetwork(DeviceID, SecurityProfile)`: Upon reaching a preliminary confidence threshold (e.g., 60%), dynamically creates a small, isolated network segment (VLAN/SDN slice) assigned to the onboarding device.  `SecurityProfile` dictates initial access rules (e.g., no internet access, limited DHCP range).
    *   `ShadowNetwork_TestSuite(DeviceID)`:  Runs a series of automated tests within the shadow network. These tests assess:
        *   Network protocol compatibility (TCP/IP stack health).
        *   DHCP client functionality.
        *   DNS resolution.
        *   Basic data throughput (ping tests).
        *   Security protocol handshake success (TLS/SSL).
    *   `Analyze_TestResults(DeviceID)`: Analyzes the test results and updates the confidence score. Flags potential compatibility issues.
    *   `Merge_To_MainNetwork(DeviceID)`:  If the confidence score exceeds a higher threshold (e.g., 90%) *and* the test suite passes, the device is seamlessly integrated into the main network.
    *   `Revert_ShadowNetwork(DeviceID)`: If the confidence score remains below the threshold or the test suite fails, the shadow network is dissolved, and the device remains unprovisioned.

*   **Software – Onboarding Device Side:**
    *   `AutoConnect_ShadowNetwork()`:  Upon detecting a "shadow network" SSID (broadcast by the NAP), automatically attempts connection *before* attempting connection to the main network.
    *   `Run_NetworkDiagnostics()`:  Executes a suite of network diagnostic tools as directed by the NAP. Sends test results back to the NAP.
    *   `Report_Capabilities()`:  Reports its network capabilities (supported protocols, security suites) to the NAP during the initial handshake.

*   **Pseudocode – NAP Side (Simplified):**

```
FUNCTION HandleProbeRequest(ProbeRequestData)
  ConfidenceScore = CalculateInitialConfidence(ProbeRequestData)
  IF ConfidenceScore > PreliminaryThreshold THEN
    ShadowNetworkID = Create_ShadowNetwork(DeviceID, SecurityProfile)
    Run_ShadowNetwork_TestSuite(DeviceID)
    TestResults = Analyze_TestResults(DeviceID)
    ConfidenceScore = UpdateConfidence(ConfidenceScore, TestResults)
    IF ConfidenceScore > IntegrationThreshold THEN
      Merge_To_MainNetwork(DeviceID)
    ELSE
      Revert_ShadowNetwork(DeviceID)
    ENDIF
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

*   **Additional Considerations:**
    *   The "SecurityProfile" can be customized based on the device type and user roles.
    *   The test suite can be expanded to include application-level tests (e.g., testing connectivity to a specific server).
    *   The system can learn from past test results to improve the accuracy of the confidence scoring.
    *   Integration with existing network management systems for monitoring and logging.
