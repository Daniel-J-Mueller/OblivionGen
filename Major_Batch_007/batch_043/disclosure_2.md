## Dynamic Dependency Mapping & Predictive Failover

**Concept:** Enhance disaster recovery by proactively mapping application dependencies *in real-time* and predicting potential failure points before they occur, enabling preemptive scaling or shifting of resources *before* a disruptive event. This goes beyond simply replicating VMs; it anticipates *how* failures will propagate and prepares accordingly.

**Specification:**

**I. Dependency Mapping Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Collects dependency data from:
    *   Network traffic analysis (packet capture, flow logs)
    *   Application performance monitoring (APM) tools
    *   System logs (kernel, application)
    *   Configuration management databases (CMDB)
    *   Code analysis (static and dynamic) – identifies function calls and inter-process communication.
*   **Mapping Algorithm:** Employs a graph database to represent application components and their dependencies.  Uses machine learning (specifically, causal inference models) to determine *directionality* and *strength* of dependencies – which components *cause* failures in others.
*   **Real-time Updates:** Dependency map updates continuously based on observed runtime behavior.  Detects changes in dependencies due to application updates, scaling, or configuration changes.
*   **API:** Provides an API for other modules to query the dependency map.

**II. Predictive Failure Analysis Module:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:** Monitors system metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O, disk I/O) and application performance metrics (response time, error rate) for anomalies.
*   **Failure Propagation Modeling:** Utilizes the dependency map to model how anomalies might propagate through the application.  Simulates failure scenarios to predict which components are likely to be affected.
*   **Risk Scoring:** Assigns a risk score to each component based on its vulnerability to failure and its impact on the overall application.
*   **Thresholds:** Dynamically adjusts failure thresholds based on component risk score. Higher risk components have more stringent thresholds.
*   **Predictive Scaling:** Proactively scales resources for components with high risk scores, or for components predicted to be affected by an impending failure.

**III. Preemptive Failover Module:**

*   **Automated Failover Triggers:** Initiates failover based on predictive analysis, *before* a disruptive event occurs.
*   **Resource Shifting:**  Shifts workloads to healthy resources based on the dependency map.  Prioritizes components critical to maintaining core functionality.
*   **Traffic Management:**  Automatically redirects traffic to healthy resources. Uses DNS-based load balancing or more sophisticated traffic shaping techniques.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** Includes a mechanism to rollback changes if the preemptive failover proves to be unnecessary or introduces new issues.

**Pseudocode (Preemptive Failover Module):**

```
function preemptive_failover()
  // Get list of components with high risk scores
  high_risk_components = get_high_risk_components()

  // For each high-risk component
  for each component in high_risk_components:
    // Identify dependent components
    dependent_components = get_dependent_components(component)

    // Initiate failover of component and its dependencies
    failover(component, dependent_components)

    // Update traffic routing to direct traffic to failover resources
    update_traffic_routing(component, failover_resources)
end function
```

**IV. Infrastructure Requirements:**

*   Distributed graph database.
*   Real-time data streaming platform (e.g., Kafka).
*   Machine learning infrastructure (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Automated infrastructure provisioning tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).
*   Monitoring and alerting system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
