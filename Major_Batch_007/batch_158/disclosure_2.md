## Dynamic Glyph Weighting for Scene Understanding

**Concept:** Extend the glyph feature extraction process to incorporate a dynamic weighting system based on contextual scene analysis. The goal is to improve recognition accuracy and resource allocation by prioritizing glyphs that are most informative *given the broader scene*.

**Specification:**

1.  **Scene Segmentation Module:** Implement a lightweight scene segmentation module that operates *prior* to glyph detection. This module will categorize the image into high-level scene types: “document,” “natural scene” (containing text elements – signs, labels, etc.), “complex scene” (mixture of elements), and “barcode/QR code focused.”

2.  **Glyph Importance Score:** Calculate a Glyph Importance Score (GIS) for each detected glyph. This score will be a composite of:
    *   **Feature Confidence:** The inherent confidence of the glyph's feature extraction (as in the original patent).
    *   **Scene Context Weight:** This is the key innovation. Based on the scene type determined in step 1, each glyph is assigned a weight.
        *   *Document:* GIS weight = 0.8. Prioritize accurate glyph recognition.
        *   *Natural Scene:* GIS weight = 0.5.  Focus on identifying key text elements – signs, labels, etc.
        *   *Complex Scene:* GIS weight = 0.3.  Prioritize speed and resource efficiency – focus on identifying the *most* prominent text.
        *   *Barcode/QR Code Focused:* GIS weight = 0.1.  Glyphs are likely noise; de-prioritize for efficiency.
    *   **Spatial Proximity:**  Glyphs closer to dominant edges or regions in the scene (determined through edge/region detection) receive a higher weight.
    *   **Contrast:** Glyphs with higher contrast against the background receive a higher weight.

    *GIS = (Feature Confidence * Scene Context Weight) + (Spatial Proximity Weight) + (Contrast Weight)*

3.  **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Implement a resource allocation system that scales processing power based on the GIS.
    *   **High GIS:** Allocate more CPU cycles to refine feature extraction, explore multiple recognition hypotheses, and perform more rigorous validation.
    *   **Medium GIS:** Use standard feature extraction and a limited set of recognition hypotheses.
    *   **Low GIS:**  Skip detailed feature extraction entirely, or use a simplified, very fast glyph recognition model.  Potentially discard glyph.

4.  **Prioritized Recognition Queue:**  Create a prioritized recognition queue based on GIS. Glyphs with higher GIS are processed first.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Scene Segmentation Module
scene_type = SceneSegmentation(image)

// Glyph Detection & Feature Extraction (as in original patent)
glyphs = DetectGlyphs(image)
for glyph in glyphs:
    features = ExtractFeatures(glyph, image)
    confidence = FeatureConfidence(features)

    // Calculate Glyph Importance Score
    spatial_proximity = CalculateSpatialProximity(glyph, image)
    contrast = CalculateContrast(glyph, image)

    if scene_type == "document":
        scene_weight = 0.8
    elif scene_type == "natural_scene":
        scene_weight = 0.5
    elif scene_type == "complex_scene":
        scene_weight = 0.3
    else: // barcode/qr code
        scene_weight = 0.1

    gis = (confidence * scene_weight) + spatial_proximity + contrast

    glyph.gis = gis

// Create prioritized queue
priority_queue = SortGlyphsByGIS(glyphs)

// Process glyphs from queue
for glyph in priority_queue:
    if glyph.gis > threshold:
        recognition_results = PerformRecognition(glyph, image)
        // Store results
    else:
        // Skip recognition
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

This system can be adapted to utilize heterogeneous processing.  The scene segmentation and initial glyph detection can be offloaded to a dedicated image processing unit (IPU) or neural processing unit (NPU), while the more computationally intensive recognition tasks can be handled by the CPU or GPU.
