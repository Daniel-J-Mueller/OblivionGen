## Modular Adaptive Grip System

**Concept:** A holder system utilizing dynamically adjusting, magnetically-coupled modules to conform to diverse object shapes and sizes. The base design is inspired by the potential for a single ‘holder’ encompassing many forms, but extends far beyond static shaping.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Dimensions:** Standard module size: 2cm x 2cm x 1cm.  Modules are cuboidal with rounded edges for comfort and aesthetic appeal.
*   **Material:** Module housing: High-impact ABS plastic with internal ferromagnetic core.
*   **Magnetic System:** Each module incorporates six neodymium magnets – one on each face. Magnets are recessed within the module housing to prevent direct contact and scratching of held objects. Magnet strength: 500-800 Gauss (adjustable via software - see below).
*   **Connectivity:** Modules connect via magnetic attraction.  Each module face contains a micro-controller with a 3-axis accelerometer & gyroscope. Modules communicate wirelessly via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh network.
*   **Central Control Unit (CCU):** A small, handheld device (approx. 10cm x 6cm x 2cm) responsible for controlling the entire system. Features a touchscreen display and processing unit.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Module Firmware:** Each module runs firmware controlling its accelerometer/gyroscope readings and BLE communication.
    *   **CCU Software:**
        *   **Shape Recognition:** Utilizes computer vision (via integrated camera) to analyze the shape of an object placed near the modules.
        *   **Adaptive Algorithm:** Based on shape recognition data, the software calculates the optimal module arrangement and magnetic strength to securely hold the object.
        *   **User Interface:** Touchscreen interface for controlling module arrangement, magnetic strength, and accessing pre-defined holding profiles (e.g., phone holder, tablet holder, tool holder).
        *   **API:** Open API allowing developers to create custom holding profiles and integrate the system with other applications.
*   **Power:** Each module is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery (approx. 50mAh).  Battery life: 8+ hours continuous use.  Charging via wireless inductive charging pad (included). CCU powered by rechargeable lithium-ion battery (approx. 2000mAh). Battery life: 12+ hours continuous use.
*   **Expansion:**  The system is designed to be highly expandable. Additional modules can be purchased and added to the system as needed.  Specialized modules (e.g., with built-in lighting, speakers, or sensors) can also be developed.

**Operation:**

1.  User places object near the modules.
2.  CCU's camera analyzes the object's shape.
3.  Software calculates optimal module arrangement and magnetic strength.
4.  Modules automatically rearrange themselves (via internal micro-actuators - see below) to conform to the object's shape.
5.  Magnetic attraction securely holds the object in place.

**Micro-Actuator System (Module Internal):**

*   Each module contains four miniature linear actuators, one per vertical face.
*   Actuators utilize piezoelectric technology for precise and silent movement.
*   Actuators allow modules to subtly adjust their position, enabling fine-tuning of the grip and accommodation of irregularly shaped objects.
*   Actuator range: 5mm per axis.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Universal phone/tablet holder
*   Tool organizer
*   Art/craft project holder
*   Robotics grippers
*   Assistive technology for individuals with disabilities.
