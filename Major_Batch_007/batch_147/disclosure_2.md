## Dynamic Temporal Anchoring for Interactive Media

**Concept:** Extend the boundary-aware supplemental content insertion to facilitate *interactive* branching narratives within media streams. Instead of simply replacing or augmenting segments, create "temporal anchors" â€“ points within the media where the user can trigger alternative content paths.

**Specs:**

*   **Anchor Point Definition:**
    *   The system identifies potential anchor points based on scene changes, dialogue cues, or significant action events detected via CV/ML analysis of video and audio streams.
    *   Each anchor point is tagged with metadata:
        *   `anchor_id`: Unique identifier.
        *   `temporal_range`: Start and end time of the anchor point within the media.
        *   `branching_options`: List of available alternative content segments (identified by segment IDs).
        *   `trigger_types`: Mechanisms for user activation (e.g., button press, voice command, gaze tracking, AI-driven prediction).
        *   `confidence_score`: A measure of certainty in the anchor point's relevance.

*   **Branching Content Management:**
    *   A content repository stores alternative segments (video, audio, interactive elements) associated with each anchor point.
    *   Segments can be pre-rendered or generated dynamically based on user input or external data sources.
    *   Content variations support different resolutions and formats for adaptive streaming.

*   **Client-Side Interaction & Stitching:**
    *   The client (user device) receives the media stream with embedded anchor point metadata.
    *   Upon user interaction or automated trigger, the client requests the appropriate branching segment from the server.
    *   A manifest stitching engine seamlessly integrates the new segment into the ongoing stream, maintaining temporal coherence.
    *   The system prioritizes low-latency stitching to minimize disruption and create a fluid experience.

*   **AI-Driven Branching:**
    *   Integrate a predictive AI model to analyze user behavior (e.g., gaze patterns, emotional responses, interaction history) and suggest branching options.
    *   The model adjusts the probability of different branches based on the user's inferred preferences.
    *   The system can personalize the branching narrative to create a unique experience for each user.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Stitching):**

```
function onAnchorPointReached(anchor_id, currentTime):
    // Get available branching options
    branching_options = getBranchingOptions(anchor_id)

    // Determine user choice (interaction or AI prediction)
    chosen_segment_id = getUserChoice(branching_options)

    // Request segment from server
    segment_data = requestSegment(chosen_segment_id)

    // Stitch segment into current stream
    new_manifest = stitchSegment(current_manifest, segment_data, currentTime)

    // Update current_manifest and resume streaming
    current_manifest = new_manifest
    resumeStreaming()
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Interactive movies/TV shows
*   Personalized training simulations
*   Immersive gaming experiences
*   Dynamic advertising with user-driven narratives
*   Educational content with branching learning paths
