## Dynamic Policy Synthesis via Role-Based Constraint Satisfaction

**Concept:** Extend the role reachability analysis to not just *identify* reachable roles, but to *synthesize* minimal, dynamically adjusted policies allowing a user to reach a desired role, given their current role and existing policy constraints.  This moves beyond static analysis to proactive policy creation.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `RoleGraph`:  Represents the relationships between roles (as in the patent).  Nodes are roles, edges represent permissible transitions based on policies.
*   `PolicyConstraint`:  A data structure defining limitations on policy changes.  Includes:
    *   `ConstraintType`: (e.g., `MaxPermissions`, `AllowedPrincipals`, `ResourceLimits`).
    *   `ConstraintValue`:  The specific limit or requirement.
*   `DesiredRole`:  The target role the user wants to assume.
*   `CurrentRole`: The user's currently active role.
*   `PolicyBundle`: A set of dynamically generated policies.

**2. Algorithm â€“ `SynthesizePolicyBundle(CurrentRole, DesiredRole, RoleGraph, PolicyConstraints)`:**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION SynthesizePolicyBundle(CurrentRole, DesiredRole, RoleGraph, PolicyConstraints):
    // 1. Pathfinding: Find shortest path in RoleGraph from CurrentRole to DesiredRole.
    path = ShortestPath(RoleGraph, CurrentRole, DesiredRole)

    IF path IS NULL:
        RETURN Error("No path exists")

    // 2. Policy Generation: Iterate through path segments and generate policies.
    policy_bundle = EmptyPolicyBundle()
    FOR i FROM 0 TO Length(path) - 2:
        source_role = path[i]
        target_role = path[i+1]

        // 3. Policy Synthesis:  Generate a temporary policy allowing transition
        temp_policy = GenerateTransitionPolicy(source_role, target_role)

        // 4. Constraint Validation:  Check if temp_policy violates any PolicyConstraints
        violation = ValidatePolicy(temp_policy, PolicyConstraints)

        IF violation IS TRUE:
            // 5. Policy Modification:  Attempt to modify temp_policy to satisfy constraints
            modified_policy = ModifyPolicy(temp_policy, PolicyConstraints)
            IF modified_policy IS NULL:
                RETURN Error("Policy cannot be satisfied with constraints")
            temp_policy = modified_policy

        // 6. Add validated policy to bundle
        policy_bundle.AddPolicy(temp_policy)

    RETURN policy_bundle
```

**3.  Key Functions (detailed):**

*   `ShortestPath(RoleGraph, StartRole, EndRole)`: Standard graph search algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's, BFS).
*   `GenerateTransitionPolicy(SourceRole, TargetRole)`: Creates a basic policy granting permissions to assume `TargetRole` from `SourceRole`.  This is the initial policy draft.
*   `ValidatePolicy(Policy, Constraints)`: Checks if the `Policy` violates any `PolicyConstraint`. Returns `TRUE` if a violation is found, `FALSE` otherwise.
*   `ModifyPolicy(Policy, Constraints)`: Attempts to adjust the `Policy` to satisfy the given `Constraints`.  This might involve:
    *   Reducing permissions granted.
    *   Adding conditions (e.g., time limits, resource limits).
    *   Re-routing the path (if multiple paths exist).  Returns `NULL` if the policy cannot be modified to satisfy constraints.

**4.  System Integration:**

*   The `SynthesizePolicyBundle` function would be integrated into the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.
*   When a user attempts to assume a role, the IAM service would first check if a direct path exists. If not, it would call `SynthesizePolicyBundle`.
*   The generated `PolicyBundle` would be temporarily applied to the user's session, allowing them to assume the target role.
*   Policies would be automatically revoked after a defined period or upon completion of the task requiring the assumed role.

**Novelty:** This moves beyond static role reachability analysis to *dynamic* policy creation, providing a proactive and adaptive approach to access control.  It addresses the scenario where a user needs to assume a role for which they don't have direct permissions, intelligently synthesizing policies to grant access while respecting defined constraints.  This could significantly improve user experience and reduce the need for manual policy adjustments.
