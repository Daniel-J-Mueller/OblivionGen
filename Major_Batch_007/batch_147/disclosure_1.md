## Dynamic Inventory Shadowing & Predictive Stow

**Concept:** Extend the opportunistic stowing/picking system to proactively “shadow” item movement based on predicted demand and dynamically adjust inventory locations *before* an agent physically interacts with the system. This minimizes travel time and congestion.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Demand Engine:**

*   **Data Inputs:** Historical order data, real-time order feeds, seasonal trends, promotional calendars, external factors (weather, events).
*   **Algorithm:** Time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) combined with machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict demand for each SKU over specific time horizons (e.g., 15-minute, 1-hour, daily).  Output is a probability distribution of expected picks.
*   **Output:** SKU-specific demand forecasts and associated confidence intervals.

**2. Dynamic Inventory Shadowing Module:**

*   **Core Function:**  Assigns “shadow locations” to SKUs based on predicted demand. These shadow locations may be physically distant from the current location.
*   **Allocation Strategy:**  
    *   High-demand SKUs are assigned shadow locations closer to shipping/packing stations or frequently visited pick zones.
    *   Low-demand SKUs are assigned shadow locations in less congested areas.
    *   Algorithm considers storage module capacity, aisle congestion, and agent travel patterns.
*   **Stow Instruction Modification:** When an agent picks a unit, the system doesn't just identify a stow location for that *specific* unit. It analyzes the *future* predicted demand for that SKU and instructs the agent to stow the unit in the assigned “shadow location”, even if it’s not the immediate empty slot.
*   **Location Prioritization:** Implement a location scoring system based on the above. Assign higher scores to shadow locations that are optimal given demand.
*   **Constraint Handling:** Accommodate restrictions such as weight limits, special handling requirements, and storage compatibility.

**3. Agent Guidance System Modification:**

*   **Route Optimization:**  The agent’s route is recalculated not only for the current pick/stow but also for the next several predicted actions, incorporating the shadow location destinations.
*   **Directional Messaging:** Agents receive instructions like: “Pick SKU X, then stow at Shadow Location Y (Aisle 5, Shelf 2, Bin 3) – optimized for anticipated demand.”

**4. System Architecture/Pseudocode:**

```
//Realtime picking
WHILE(pickupRequest) {
    pickSku(sku, quantity);
    //Determine stow location.
    location = findStowLocation(sku, quantity)

    //Alternative: determine SHADOW stow location, with predicted value
    shadowLocation = findShadowStowLocation(sku, predictedValue)

    IF(shadowLocation != null) {
        stowInstructions = "Stow at Shadow Location: " + shadowLocation
    } ELSE {
        stowInstructions = "Stow at Nearest Available Location"
    }
    sendStowInstructionsToAgent(agentID, stowInstructions)
}
```

**5. Hardware Integration:**

*   Requires integration with existing WMS and routing systems.
*   Potential integration with autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to transport items to shadow locations.
*   Leverages existing sensor data (e.g., RFID, vision systems) to monitor inventory levels and location.

**6. Scalability & Maintenance:**

*   Designed for modularity to handle increasing SKU volumes and warehouse complexity.
*   Regular model retraining is crucial to adapt to changing demand patterns.
*   Monitoring dashboards to track system performance and identify potential bottlenecks.
