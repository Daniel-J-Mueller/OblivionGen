## Adaptive Prosody Generation via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Integrate real-time biofeedback data (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial muscle tension) from the user *during* speech synthesis to dynamically adjust prosody – not just *what* is said, but *how* it is said – creating a synthesized voice that subtly mirrors the user's emotional and physiological state. This aims for a heightened sense of presence and empathy in synthetic communication, and potential therapeutic applications.

**Specs:**

1.  **Biofeedback Sensor Integration:**
    *   Hardware: Compatible with commercially available biofeedback sensors (e.g., Empatica E4, Muse 2).  Sensor data streams should be accessible via API.
    *   Data Acquisition: Real-time sampling of biofeedback signals (at least 10 Hz).
    *   Signal Processing: Raw biofeedback data will be preprocessed: noise filtering, artifact removal, baseline correction. Feature extraction will focus on:
        *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV): RMSSD, SDNN.
        *   Skin Conductance Level (SCL).
        *   Facial EMG (muscle tension in key areas - brow, lips).

2.  **Prosody Mapping Module:**
    *   Mapping Function:  A learned mapping (neural network or rule-based system) translating biofeedback features into prosodic parameters:
        *   Pitch contour:  HRV (higher variability = wider pitch range, more expressive contour). SCL (increased conductance = higher baseline pitch).
        *   Speech Rate: HRV (lower variability = slower rate). SCL (higher conductance = faster rate).
        *   Energy/Volume: SCL (higher conductance = greater volume). Facial EMG (muscle tension = volume modulation).
        *   Pauses: HRV (lower variability = longer pauses, emphasis on key words).
    *   Adaptation: The mapping function must be adaptable; a calibration phase would establish a personalized mapping for each user. This could be done through a guided ‘emotional mirroring’ exercise, where the user expresses different emotions while the system learns the corresponding biofeedback/prosody relationship.

3.  **TTS Integration:**
    *   Compatibility: Integrate with existing TTS engines (e.g., Tacotron2, FastSpeech2). The prosodic parameters generated by the Prosody Mapping Module will be fed as control signals to the TTS engine.
    *   Control Granularity:  Control over prosody should be applied at the phoneme or syllable level to allow for subtle, nuanced variations.
    *   Real-Time Processing:  The entire pipeline (biofeedback acquisition, signal processing, prosody mapping, TTS) must operate in real-time (latency < 200ms) to maintain a natural conversational flow.

4. **System Architecture:**

    ```pseudocode
    // Main Loop
    while (true):
        // 1. Acquire Biofeedback Data
        bio_data = acquire_biofeedback_data()

        // 2. Preprocess Biofeedback Data
        processed_bio_data = preprocess_biofeedback(bio_data)

        // 3. Map Biofeedback to Prosody
        prosodic_parameters = map_biofeedback_to_prosody(processed_bio_data)

        // 4. Synthesize Speech with Modified Prosody
        text_to_synthesize = get_next_text_input()
        audio_output = synthesize_speech(text_to_synthesize, prosodic_parameters)

        // 5. Output Audio
        play_audio(audio_output)
    ```

5.  **Potential Applications:**
    *   Enhanced virtual assistants (more empathetic, natural interactions).
    *   Therapeutic applications (e.g., biofeedback-assisted speech therapy, anxiety management).
    *   Accessibility tools (synthetic voices that adapt to the user's emotional state).
    *   Realistic avatar animation (prosodic cues driving facial expressions).
