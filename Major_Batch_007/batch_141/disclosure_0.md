## HSM-Based Decentralized Identity Attestation

**Concept:** Leverage the HSM cluster’s secure key storage and synchronization capabilities not for cryptographic operations *on* data, but for verifying attestations *about* data ownership and provenance, creating a decentralized identity system anchored to hardware security.

**Specification:**

**1. Attestation Key Hierarchy:**

*   Each entity (person, device, application) desiring a verifiable identity possesses a primary HSM-protected key pair.
*   This primary key is used to sign a “root of trust” certificate containing metadata about the entity.
*   Subordinate keys are generated for specific purposes (e.g., data access, service authorization) and chained to the root via digital signatures.  These subordinate keys *also* reside within an HSM, potentially distributed across multiple HSMs in a cluster for redundancy.

**2.  HSM Cluster as Attestation Authority:**

*   The HSM cluster doesn’t *store* identity data directly.  It *verifies* attestations.
*   When an entity presents an attestation (a signed claim about its identity or data ownership), the HSM cluster:
    *   Validates the signature chain back to the root of trust.
    *   Confirms the validity of certificates in the chain (revocation lists, timestamps).
    *   Optionally, performs checks on the HSM that generated the signature (trust level, revocation status).

**3.  Data Linking & Proof of Provenance:**

*   Data objects are cryptographically linked to the entity’s identity via a hash of the data combined with a signature from a designated HSM-protected key.
*   This creates a verifiable “proof of provenance”.
*   Anyone can verify the authenticity of the data and trace its origin back to the registered entity.

**4. Synchronization for High Availability & Scalability:**

*   The HSM cluster’s key synchronization mechanism ensures that attestation verification remains available even if individual HSMs fail.
*   The cluster can be scaled horizontally to handle a large number of attestation requests.

**5. Pseudocode for Attestation Verification:**

```
FUNCTION verifyAttestation(attestationData, entityID):
  // 1. Extract signature and data from attestationData

  // 2. Retrieve entity’s root of trust certificate from a distributed ledger or database.
  rootCert = getRootCert(entityID)

  // 3. Verify signature chain using rootCert as anchor.
  signatureValid = verifySignatureChain(attestationData.signature, attestationData.data, rootCert)

  IF signatureValid == FALSE:
    RETURN FALSE // Invalid signature

  // 4. Check certificate revocation status (e.g., CRL, OCSP).
  revocationCheck = checkCertificateRevocation(rootCert)

  IF revocationCheck == FALSE:
    RETURN FALSE // Certificate revoked

  // 5.  Verify HSM generating signature is trusted.
  HSMTrustCheck = verifyHSMTrust(signatureHSMId)

  IF HSMTrustCheck == FALSE:
     RETURN FALSE // Untrusted HSM

  // 6. Attestation is valid
  RETURN TRUE
```

**6. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing HSM Cluster (as described in provided patent)
*   Secure Communication Channels (TLS, etc.)
*   Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for Root of Trust Certificate Storage (optional, for increased decentralization)

**7.  Potential Use Cases:**

*   Supply Chain Tracking
*   Digital Rights Management
*   Secure Data Sharing
*   Decentralized Identity Management
*   IoT Device Authentication

This shifts the HSM from a protector of keys used in computation to a validator of *claims* about data and identity, opening opportunities for building trust in decentralized systems.  It leverages the synchronization capabilities of the HSM cluster to create a highly available and scalable attestation service.
