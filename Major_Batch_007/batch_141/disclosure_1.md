## Secure Device Attestation & Dynamic Root of Trust Provisioning

**Concept:** Expand the secure provisioning concept beyond initial device setup. Implement a system for continuous device attestation *and* dynamic root of trust provisioning – allowing a device to ‘rotate’ its trusted firmware components and cryptographic keys under secure control, even *after* deployment. This combats long-term attacks targeting firmware vulnerabilities.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Component: Attestation & Provisioning Module (APM)**

*   **Core:** Secure Microcontroller (e.g., ARM TrustZone-M based) with dedicated hardware crypto engine (AES, SHA, ECC/RSA).  Must support secure boot and tamper detection.
*   **Memory:** Non-volatile storage (e.g., eFUSE, OTP) for storing initial root of trust keys, device identifiers, and provisioning flags. Sufficient storage for multiple key versions & revocation lists.
*   **Interface:**  Dedicated, physically secured communication interface (e.g., I2C, SPI with authentication) for communication with the host processor and a remote Provisioning Server.
*   **Tamper Detection:** Integrated sensors (voltage, temperature, physical intrusion) connected to the secure microcontroller for real-time tamper detection.
*   **Power:** Dedicated power domain, isolated from the main system power rail, to ensure operation even during system compromise.

**2. Firmware – APM Firmware**

*   **Secure Boot:**  Firmware must be cryptographically signed and verified during boot.  Chain of trust established from hardware root of trust.
*   **Attestation Protocol:** Implement a standardized attestation protocol (e.g., Remote Attestation via TLS) to provide proof of device integrity to the Provisioning Server. Attestation data includes:
    *   Device ID
    *   Firmware Version
    *   SHA256 hash of critical firmware components
    *   Cryptographic signature of attestation data.
*   **Provisioning Protocol:** Secure communication channel with the Provisioning Server for receiving updated firmware and cryptographic keys.  Utilize TLS 1.3 or higher with mutual authentication.
*   **Key Management:** Secure storage and management of cryptographic keys. Support for key rotation and revocation.
*   **Rollback Prevention:**  Mechanisms to prevent downgrading to vulnerable firmware versions.
*   **Dynamic Root of Trust (DRoT):** Capability to dynamically update the root of trust keys under secure control, effectively establishing a new foundation of trust.

**3. Firmware – Host Processor Integration**

*   **APM Driver:** Driver to facilitate communication between the host processor and the APM.
*   **Attestation Request Handler:** Module to request attestation reports from the APM.
*   **Provisioning Request Handler:** Module to initiate firmware updates and key rotations based on instructions from the Provisioning Server.
*   **Secure Storage:**  Protected memory region for storing sensitive data (e.g., encryption keys).

**4. Provisioning Server**

*   **Device Management:** Database to track device identities, firmware versions, and key status.
*   **Attestation Verification:** Module to verify attestation reports from devices.
*   **Firmware Distribution:** Repository for storing firmware updates.
*   **Key Management:** Secure storage and management of cryptographic keys.
*   **Policy Engine:** Define policies for firmware updates and key rotations based on device identity, firmware version, and security risk.
*   **Revocation List Management:** Maintain a list of compromised devices and revoked keys.
*   **DRoT Orchestration:** Initiates and manages the dynamic root of trust rotation process for authorized devices.

**Pseudocode – DRoT Rotation Sequence:**

```
// Provisioning Server Initiates DRoT Rotation
1.  Receive DRoT Rotation Request for Device X
2.  Generate New Root Key Pair (KeyA)
3.  Encrypt KeyA with Device X's Public Key
4.  Send Encrypted KeyA to Device X's APM
5.  Send Instructions to APM to Verify New Key Signature
6.  APM Verifies New Key Signature (using existing root of trust)
7.  APM Stores New KeyA in Secure Storage
8.  APM Revokes Old Root Key
9.  APM Reports Successful Key Rotation to Provisioning Server

// Device APM Verification
1.  Receive Encrypted KeyA from Provisioning Server
2.  Decrypt KeyA using Existing Root of Trust
3.  Verify Signature on KeyA (from Trusted Authority)
4.  If Signature Valid: Store KeyA, Revoke Old Key, Report Success
5.  If Signature Invalid: Report Failure
```

**Innovation:** This system provides continuous security beyond initial provisioning. DRoT allows mitigation of vulnerabilities even after deployment, increasing device lifespan and reducing security risks. The system enforces a strong chain of trust from hardware to software and the Provisioning Server. This differs significantly from static provisioning methods.
