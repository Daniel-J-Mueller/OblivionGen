## Dynamic Influence Mapping & Predictive Bundling

**Concept:** Expand beyond individual social influence scores to create a dynamic, multi-layered 'Influence Map' based on real-time network activity and predictive modeling.  Instead of simply boosting visibility based on a static score, proactively *create* influence through strategically bundled product offerings.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Processing:**

1.  **Real-time Network Crawl (Permissioned):** Access (with explicit user consent & API limitations enforced by the social networking system) public activity feeds of user's connections. Focus on item mentions, likes, shares, and relevant keyword associations.  This goes beyond simply 'who is connected to whom' – it’s about *what* they’re engaging with.
2.  **Influence Node Creation:** Each connection becomes a 'Node' in the Influence Map. Node attributes:
    *   `UserID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `InfluenceScore`: Base score (from patent – maintained but secondary).
    *   `ActivityWeight`: Calculated from real-time network crawl – frequency & relevance of item-related activity. Decays over time.
    *   `CategoryAffinity`: Determined by analyzing the categories of items the user frequently interacts with.
    *   `BundleReceptivity`:  A predictive score indicating the likelihood a user will respond positively to a bundled offer (initially based on historical data, refined by A/B testing).
3.  **Relationship Mapping:** Nodes are linked based on:
    *   Direct Connection (social network link).
    *   Shared Interests (based on `CategoryAffinity`).
    *   Influence Propagation (Node A frequently interacts with content from Node B, implying influence).
4.  **Graph Database:** Utilize a graph database (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) to store and query the Influence Map efficiently.

**II. Predictive Bundling Engine:**

1.  **Item Similarity Calculation:**  Determine item similarity based on:
    *   Co-purchase data.
    *   Category.
    *   User reviews (semantic analysis).
2.  **Bundle Optimization Algorithm:**
    *   Input: User ID, Current Cart (if any).
    *   Process:
        *   Identify top N potential bundle items based on item similarity and Influence Map data.
        *   For each potential bundle item:
            *   Calculate the predicted ‘Bundle Lift’ – the expected increase in purchase probability due to the bundle.  This is based on:
                *   The user's own preferences.
                *   The preferences of their influential connections (weighted by `ActivityWeight` and `BundleReceptivity`).
                *   Price sensitivity (estimated from historical data).
            *   Apply a penalty for bundling items already in the user's cart.
        *   Select the bundle configuration that maximizes predicted Bundle Lift.
3.  **Dynamic Bundle Presentation:**
    *   Display bundle offers with personalized messaging that highlights the connections to the user’s network (“Your friend [Name] also loves this!”).
    *   A/B test different bundle configurations and messaging strategies continuously.
    *   Offer varying levels of discount based on the strength of the predicted Bundle Lift.
    *   Introduce ‘social proof’ elements – display how many of the user’s connections have purchased or expressed interest in bundled items.

**III.  Pseudocode (Bundle Optimization):**

```
function optimizeBundle(userID, cartItems):
  influenceMap = getInfluenceMap(userID)
  potentialBundles = findPotentialBundles(cartItems)

  bestBundle = null
  maxLift = 0

  for bundle in potentialBundles:
    lift = calculateBundleLift(userID, bundle, influenceMap)
    if lift > maxLift:
      maxLift = lift
      bestBundle = bundle

  return bestBundle
```

```
function calculateBundleLift(userID, bundle, influenceMap):
  baseProbability = predictPurchaseProbability(userID, bundle)
  socialInfluence = 0
  for item in bundle:
    for connection in influenceMap.connections:
      if connection.CategoryAffinity == item.category:
        socialInfluence += connection.ActivityWeight * connection.BundleReceptivity
  return baseProbability + socialInfluence
```

**IV. Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:** Strict adherence to data privacy regulations is paramount.  All data collection and usage must be transparent and require explicit user consent.
*   **Scalability:**  The system must be able to handle a large number of users and connections.
*   **Real-Time Performance:** The Influence Map and bundle optimization algorithm must be able to run in real-time to provide a seamless user experience.
*   **Cold Start Problem:** Implement strategies to address the cold start problem for new users or items with limited data.  (e.g., leverage general category preferences or popularity data).
