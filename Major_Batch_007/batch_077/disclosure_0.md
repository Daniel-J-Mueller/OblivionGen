## Autonomous Swarm Obstacle Negotiation with Predictive Bio-inspiration

**Concept:** Extend autonomous UAV obstacle avoidance beyond single-vehicle operation and reactive responses to proactive, swarm-level negotiation inspired by flocking bird/fish behavior, incorporating predicted obstacle trajectories and resource-aware path planning.

**Specifications:**

**I. System Architecture:**

*   **Multi-UAV Network:** A network of *N* UAVs, each equipped with:
    *   High-resolution RGB-D cameras (obstacle detection & distance estimation)
    *   IMU/GPS (precise localization & velocity data)
    *   Onboard processing unit (edge computing)
    *   Secure communication module (UAV-to-UAV & ground station)
*   **Ground Control Station (GCS):**  Provides mission planning, monitoring, and emergency override.

**II. Data Acquisition & Processing:**

1.  **Local Obstacle Mapping:** Each UAV independently creates a local 3D map of its surroundings using RGB-D data.  Obstacles are classified (static/dynamic, size, velocity vector – estimated via temporal analysis).
2.  **Trajectory Prediction:**  For dynamic obstacles, employ a Kalman filter or LSTM network to predict their future trajectories over a defined time horizon (e.g., 5 seconds).
3.  **Information Sharing:** UAVs broadcast obstacle maps, trajectory predictions, and *intended* flight paths to neighboring UAVs within a defined communication range.  Data is timestamped and prioritized (high-confidence predictions/imminent collisions have higher priority).
4.  **Centralized Negotiation (Distributed Algorithm):** Each UAV runs a distributed negotiation algorithm:
    *   **Conflict Detection:** Based on received information, each UAV identifies potential collisions with predicted obstacle trajectories *and* with the intended paths of other UAVs.
    *   **Cost Function:**  Define a cost function that incorporates:
        *   Collision Risk (primary)
        *   Path Deviation (from optimal route)
        *   Energy Consumption (based on maneuver type & UAV battery level)
        *   Communication Overhead (penalize excessive broadcasts)
    *   **Bid/Offer:** Each UAV generates a set of alternative flight paths (e.g., slight deviations, altitude adjustments) and ‘bids’ on them, based on the cost function.  The bid represents the UAV’s willingness to take that path.
    *   **Auction/Agreement:**  A decentralized auction mechanism (e.g., Vickrey auction) is used to determine the optimal set of paths for the swarm.  UAVs ‘win’ bids based on minimizing the overall swarm cost.
    *   **Path Resolution:** Agreed-upon paths are distributed to the UAVs’ autopilot modules.

**III.  Pseudocode (Simplified Negotiation Loop – Single UAV):**

```
loop:
    // 1. Acquire data
    obstacle_map = get_obstacle_map()
    predicted_trajectories = predict_obstacle_trajectories(obstacle_map)
    neighbor_info = receive_neighbor_data()

    // 2. Identify conflicts
    conflicts = detect_conflicts(predicted_trajectories, neighbor_info)

    // 3. Generate alternative paths
    alternative_paths = generate_alternative_paths(conflicts)

    // 4. Evaluate paths
    for path in alternative_paths:
        cost = calculate_cost(path, conflicts, neighbor_info, energy_level)
        path.cost = cost

    // 5. Bid/Offer (broadcast bids to neighbors)
    broadcast_bids(alternative_paths)

    // 6. Receive bids from neighbors
    received_bids = receive_bids()

    // 7. Auction/Agreement (determine optimal path – distributed algorithm)
    optimal_path = determine_optimal_path(received_bids, alternative_paths)

    // 8. Execute path
    execute_path(optimal_path)
end loop
```

**IV.  Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance embedded processors (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson series)
*   Real-time operating system (RTOS) for deterministic performance.
*   Secure, low-latency communication modules (e.g., 5G/6G, dedicated mesh networks).
*   High-capacity batteries and efficient power management systems.

**V.  Novelty:**

*   **Proactive Swarm Negotiation:** Moves beyond reactive obstacle avoidance to proactive, collaborative path planning.
*   **Trajectory Prediction:** Incorporates predicted obstacle trajectories for more informed decision-making.
*   **Resource-Aware Optimization:**  Considers energy consumption and communication overhead in path planning.
*   **Decentralized Architecture:**  Eliminates the need for a central controller, increasing robustness and scalability.
