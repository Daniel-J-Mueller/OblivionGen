## Adaptive Segment Prioritization & Predictive Container Allocation

**Concept:** Dynamically prioritize video segments based on *per-frame* complexity analysis, coupled with a predictive container allocation system that pre-emptively scales resources based on anticipated processing demands. This moves beyond simple load balancing and addresses bottlenecks *before* they occur, optimizing not just throughput, but also *cost* by avoiding over-provisioning.

**Specs:**

**1. Complexity Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw video frame data (individual frames extracted from segments).
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a lightweight, parallelizable algorithm (e.g., a simplified optical flow calculation combined with histogram analysis) to assign a ‘complexity score’ to each frame. Factors: motion vector magnitude, color variance, texture density.
    *   Calculate a segment complexity score as the weighted average of its constituent frame scores.  Weighting can prioritize keyframes or scenes identified through shot detection.
*   **Output:**  Segment ID + Complexity Score.

**2. Predictive Container Allocation System:**

*   **Data Input:**
    *   Historical processing data: Segment complexity scores, processing times, container resource utilization (CPU, memory, GPU).
    *   Incoming video file metadata: Resolution, frame rate, codec.
    *   Real-time processing feedback: Current container load, queue lengths.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Training Phase:** A machine learning model (e.g., a time-series forecasting algorithm like LSTM or Prophet) is trained on historical data to predict the processing time and resource requirements for new segments based on their complexity scores and video characteristics.
    *   **Prediction Phase:** For each incoming segment:
        *   Calculate complexity score (via Complexity Analysis Module).
        *   Predict processing time and resource needs using the trained model.
        *   Dynamically allocate containers *before* segment processing begins, pre-provisioning resources based on the prediction.
        *   Implement a ‘shadow container’ system. Instead of launching containers on demand, maintain a pool of pre-initialized ‘shadow containers’ in a low-resource state. The predictive system ‘wakes up’ the appropriate number of containers and assigns them segments.
*   **Output:** Container assignment for each segment, pre-provisioned resources.

**3. Adaptive Prioritization Queue:**

*   **Input:** Segment ID, Complexity Score, Container Assignment
*   **Process:** Segments are enqueued based on a combination of Complexity Score (higher scores = higher priority) and remaining time within a user-defined Service Level Agreement (SLA). Segments nearing SLA deadlines are boosted in priority, even if their complexity is lower.
*   **Output:** Prioritized segment processing queue.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Complexity Analysis Module
function calculate_segment_complexity(segment):
  for each frame in segment:
    frame_complexity = calculate_frame_complexity(frame) // Optical Flow, Histogram Analysis
  segment_complexity = average(frame_complexity)
  return segment_complexity

// Predictive Container Allocation
function predict_resource_needs(segment_complexity, video_metadata):
  // Trained ML model predicts processing time & resources
  predicted_time, predicted_resources = ML_Model.predict(segment_complexity, video_metadata)
  return predicted_time, predicted_resources

function allocate_container(segment, predicted_resources):
  // Locate/Launch container with sufficient resources
  container = ContainerPool.get_container(predicted_resources)
  return container

// Main Processing Loop
for each segment in video_file:
  segment_complexity = calculate_segment_complexity(segment)
  predicted_time, predicted_resources = predict_resource_needs(segment_complexity, video_metadata)
  container = allocate_container(segment, predicted_resources)
  container.process(segment)
```

**Innovation Points:**

*   **Per-frame complexity:** Moves beyond segment-level analysis for more granular resource allocation.
*   **Predictive scaling:** Proactively allocates resources, reducing latency and improving throughput.
*   **Shadow container pool:** Minimizes container launch overhead.
*   **SLA-aware prioritization:** Balances processing speed with user-defined requirements.
