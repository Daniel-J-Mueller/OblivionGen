**Dynamic Predictive Pre-Rendering with Multi-Tiered Detail**

**Concept:** Extend the pre-fetching concept to not just *load* more images, but *render* them at varying levels of detail *before* the user scrolls to them.  This system dynamically adjusts rendering fidelity based on predicted scroll speed *and* proximity to the viewport.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component 1: Scroll Prediction Engine:**
    *   Input:  Scroll position, scroll velocity (instantaneous & average over 500ms), acceleration.
    *   Algorithm: Kalman filter or similar predictive model to forecast future scroll position with confidence intervals. Output: Predicted scroll position (primary), confidence interval (scroll range), predicted scroll velocity.
    *   Frequency: 60Hz update rate.

*   **Component 2: Multi-Tier Rendering Pipeline:**
    *   Image sources: Original image data.
    *   Rendering Tiers (defined by image resolution & quality settings):
        *   Tier 0: Low-resolution placeholder (e.g., 64x64, blurred).  Used for images outside the predicted scroll range + confidence interval.
        *   Tier 1: Medium-resolution (e.g., 512x512, moderate compression). Used for images within the predicted scroll range but *outside* the immediate viewport.
        *   Tier 2: High-resolution (e.g., 2048x2048, minimal compression). Used for images currently within the viewport *and* the immediate next few images.
        *   Tier 3: Ultra-high-resolution (e.g., 4096x4096, lossless). For zoomed or inspected images.
    *   Rendering Queue: Prioritized queue based on predicted scroll position, tier, and rendering priority (viewport > predicted range).

*   **Component 3: Dynamic Tier Assignment:**
    *   Input: Predicted scroll position, confidence interval, current viewport, predicted scroll velocity.
    *   Logic:
        1.  Viewport: Images in the viewport always rendered Tier 2 or Tier 3.
        2.  Within Confidence Interval (but not viewport): Render Tier 1.
        3.  Outside Confidence Interval: Render Tier 0.
        4.  Adjust rendering tier *dynamically* based on predicted scroll velocity:
            *   Fast Scroll: Prioritize Tier 1 and Tier 0 for distant images to minimize lag.
            *   Slow Scroll / Stationary: Increase Tier 2/Tier 3 rendering for images approaching the viewport.

*   **Component 4:  Memory Management:**
    *   Image Cache: Maintain a cache of rendered images (keyed by URL/image ID).  LRU eviction policy.
    *   Tiered Memory Allocation: Allocate more memory to higher tiers (Tier 2/Tier 3) when available.
    *   Background Rendering: Offload rendering tasks to a separate thread or process to avoid blocking the main UI thread.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Tier Assignment):**

```
function assignTier(image, predictedScrollPosition, confidenceInterval, currentViewport, predictedScrollVelocity) {
  if (image in currentViewport) {
    return Tier 2 or Tier 3 // High detail
  } else if (predictedScrollPosition - confidenceInterval <= image.position <= predictedScrollPosition + confidenceInterval) {
    if (predictedScrollVelocity > thresholdFastScroll) {
      return Tier 1 // Medium detail, fast scroll
    } else {
      return Tier 1 // Medium detail
    }
  } else {
    return Tier 0 // Placeholder
  }
}
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond pre-loading by *actively rendering* content at appropriate levels of detail *before* the user interacts with it. It anticipates needs based on velocity and prediction, providing a smoother, more responsive experience. It allows for the display of extremely high resolution images without the user having to wait for them to load, which is the primary goal of this system.
