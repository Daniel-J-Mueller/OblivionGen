## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Sorting

**Concept:** Extend the singulation/sorting concept beyond simple physical separation to incorporate resonant frequency analysis for material identification and automated, dynamic reconfiguration of the sorting process.

**Specifications:**

*   **Resonance Chambers:** Integrate small, individually addressable resonance chambers *above* each item slot on the singulation conveyor. These chambers generate and detect acoustic resonance frequencies.
*   **Frequency Profile Database:** A database storing resonant frequency profiles for various materials/item types. This database is dynamically updated via machine learning.
*   **Material Identification System:** Software analyzes the frequency response of each item in a resonance chamber, matching it to an entry in the frequency profile database to identify the material/item type.
*   **Dynamic Ledge Reconfiguration:** The retaining ledge is segmented into independently controllable sections. Based on the identified material/item type, these sections can *raise or lower* dynamically, guiding specific items onto different output streams *before* they reach the end of the main conveyor.
*   **Air Jets:** Precisely aimed air jets located above the ledge, activated based on the material ID, to nudge items towards designated output streams if ledge reconfiguration isn’t sufficient.
*   **Multi-Layered Conveyor System:** Employ a layered conveyor system. The primary conveyor (with resonance chambers/dynamic ledge) is above a secondary “catch-all” conveyor. Items that fall through (e.g., due to size/shape inconsistencies) are caught on the lower conveyor for manual inspection/re-routing.
*   **Feedback Loop:** The system tracks sorting accuracy. Misidentified items are flagged, and the frequency profile database is automatically refined using the new data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
Load Frequency Profile Database
Initialize Resonance Chamber Array
Initialize Dynamic Ledge Segment Array
Initialize Air Jet Array

//Main Loop (for each item)
Item Arrives in Slot
Activate Resonance Chamber Above Item
Analyze Frequency Response
Match Response to Frequency Profile Database
ItemType = Result of Database Match

If ItemType == "Unknown"
  Flag Item for Manual Inspection
  Route to Secondary Conveyor
Else
  //Configure Dynamic Ledge
  For Each LedgeSegment
    If LedgeSegment == ItemType
      LedgeSegment.Height = Low
    Else
      LedgeSegment.Height = High
    End If
  End For

  //Activate Air Jets (if needed)
  If Item is close to wrong output stream
    AirJet.Activate(Direction = CorrectOutputStream)
  End If

  //Move Item to Output Stream
  Item.MoveTo(OutputStream = IdentifiedStream)
End If

//Feedback Loop
If Item was mis-sorted
  Update Frequency Profile Database with new frequency data
End If

```

**Materials:**

*   High-strength aluminum alloy for conveyor frame and ledge segments.
*   Acoustically transparent materials (e.g., specialized polymers) for resonance chambers.
*   Precision micro-actuators for dynamic ledge control.
*   High-speed microprocessors and sensors for real-time data analysis.
