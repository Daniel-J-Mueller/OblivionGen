## Dynamic Contextual Device Handoff - "Momentum"

**Concept:** Extending the device-to-device data transfer beyond simple telephony to encompass active application states and contextual data, creating a seamless “momentum” transfer between devices.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core System – “Momentum Engine”**

*   **Module:** Kernel-level service running on all supported devices.
*   **Function:**  Monitors active application states (window position, scroll offset, input focus, internal data structures representing state) and system context (location, motion sensors, connected peripherals).
*   **Data Packaging:** Utilizes a lossless compression algorithm optimized for application state data.  Packages data into a “Momentum Packet”.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Utilizes a low-latency, short-range wireless protocol (UWB, enhanced Bluetooth) for Momentum Packet transfer.  Falls back to Wi-Fi Direct as a secondary option.

**2. Proximity & Device Discovery Enhancement**

*   **Adaptive Proximity Threshold:** Dynamically adjusts proximity detection range based on user behavior & environment (e.g., wider range in open spaces, narrower range in crowded areas).
*   **Contextual Device Filtering:** Filters discovered devices based on application compatibility and user preferences. (e.g., "show me devices running a compatible version of Adobe Lightroom").
*   **Device Role Negotiation:** Establishes a device role (source/destination) based on signal strength, battery level, and processing capabilities.

**3. Application State Capture & Transfer**

*   **Application Registration:** Applications register with the Momentum Engine to specify which data needs to be captured for seamless transfer.  (API calls for state capture/restore).
*   **Delta Capture:** Only captures *changes* to application state since the last transfer. (Minimizes data transfer size).
*   **State Restoration:** On the destination device, the Momentum Engine restores the application to the exact state it was in on the source device. (Window position, scroll offset, input focus, data).

**4.  User Interface & Interaction**

*   **Gesture-Based Handoff:**  A swipe gesture between devices initiates the handoff process.
*   **Visual Feedback:**  A visual arc between devices indicates data transfer progress.
*   **Confirmation Prompt:**  A prompt on the destination device confirms acceptance of the application state.
*   **"Continue On" Notification:** Notifications on secondary devices offering to "Continue On" existing sessions. (e.g., "Continue editing this photo on your tablet?").

**Pseudocode (Simplified Handoff Sequence):**

```
// Source Device
function onSwipeGestureDetected(destinationDevice) {
  captureApplicationState()
  createMomentumPacket(applicationState)
  sendMomentumPacket(destinationDevice)
}

// Destination Device
function onReceiveMomentumPacket(packet) {
  applicationState = decodeMomentumPacket(packet)
  restoreApplicationState(applicationState)
  launchApplication() // if not already running
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Seamlessly transferring a complex photo edit between a desktop and tablet.
*   Continuing a game session on a different device.
*   Moving a video conference call between devices without interruption.
*   Transferring a partially completed document between devices.
