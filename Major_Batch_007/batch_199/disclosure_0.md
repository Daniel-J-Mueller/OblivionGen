## Modular Buoyant Sensor Array

**Concept:** Expand the low-density, buoyant enclosure concept into a modular, interconnected sensor array for environmental monitoring – specifically, sub-surface aquatic data collection. Instead of a single device, envision a 'string' of buoyant, wirelessly networked nodes, each containing sensors and powered by localized energy harvesting.

**Specifications:**

*   **Node Dimensions:** Approximately 10cm x 5cm x 3cm. (Scalable based on sensor suite)
*   **Housing Material:** Closed-cell foam (EPP or similar) with a density < 0.8 g/cm³.  Surface coated with a bio-fouling resistant polymer.
*   **Internal Structure:** Each node contains:
    *   Microcontroller (ESP32 or similar).
    *   Wireless communication module (Bluetooth Low Energy, LoRaWAN).
    *   Rechargeable solid-state battery (Li-S or similar, optimized for low-power operation).
    *   Energy Harvesting Module:  Piezoelectric generators embedded within the foam structure, converting wave/current motion into electrical energy. Miniaturized thermoelectric generator (TEG) harvesting temperature gradients.
    *   Sensor Suite (configurable):
        *   Dissolved Oxygen Sensor
        *   pH Sensor
        *   Conductivity Sensor
        *   Temperature Sensor
        *   Hydrophone (for acoustic monitoring)
        *   Miniature turbidity sensor
*   **Interconnection:** Each node possesses magnetic docking points along its length. Nodes automatically connect to form a linear array.  Connection establishes power/data link (inductive charging/data transfer).  Array length scalable by adding/removing nodes.
*   **Deployment:** Array deployed from surface, self-submerging to pre-programmed depth via ballast control. Anchor point at one end for stationary deployments. Alternatively, array can be configured to 'drift' with currents.
*   **Data Transmission:**  Data aggregated at the 'head' node and transmitted to a base station via LoRaWAN or satellite communication.
*   **Foam Midframe:** A rigid foam core within each node houses the electronics and provides structural support. The core incorporates channels for wiring and sensor integration.
*   **Outer Housing:**  Resilient foam over-molded around the midframe and sensors, creating a waterproof seal.  Modular sections of the outer housing are color-coded to indicate sensor type.
*   **Software:**
    *   Node firmware: Handles sensor data acquisition, wireless communication, energy harvesting control, and node-to-node communication.
    *   Base station software: Receives and processes data from the array, providing real-time visualization and data logging.
    *   Data analytics platform:  Provides tools for data analysis, trend identification, and predictive modeling.



**Pseudocode (Node Firmware):**

```
// Initialize sensors, wireless module, energy harvesting module
function initialize() {
  // Setup sensor pins
  // Initialize wireless communication
  // Start energy harvesting
}

function readSensors() {
  // Read data from each sensor
  // Apply calibration factors
  // Return sensor data object
}

function transmitData() {
  // Package sensor data
  // Transmit data via wireless module
}

function harvestEnergy() {
  // Monitor energy harvesting module
  // Store harvested energy in battery
}

function mainLoop() {
  while (true) {
    sensorData = readSensors()
    transmitData(sensorData)
    harvestEnergy()
    delay(10 seconds)
  }
}
```
