## Adaptive Haptic Feedback Masking

**Concept:** Expand the interference suppression to *actively* mask interference *through* haptic feedback, rather than solely modifying touch input interpretation. The system will analyze detected interference events, predict affected touch sensor areas, and *counteract* the interference with localized haptic pulses.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution haptic actuator array integrated beneath the touch sensor surface. Resolution target: 1mm spacing. Actuator type: Ultrasonic transducers preferred for speed and precision.
    *   Dedicated processing unit (FPGA or similar) for real-time interference analysis and haptic pulse generation.
    *   Existing touch sensor and display driver infrastructure from the source patent.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **Interference Profile Database:** A database correlating interference event types (display updates, haptic outputs, charging events, etc.) with spatial interference patterns on the touch sensor. This can be built through empirical testing and machine learning.
    *   **Real-time Interference Detection:** Utilizing existing interference detection mechanisms.
    *   **Spatial Interference Prediction:** Based on the detected event and the Interference Profile Database, predict the area of the touch sensor affected by interference.
    *   **Haptic Counter-Pulse Generation:** Generate localized haptic pulses on the affected area, timed to *cancel out* the interference. The pulses should be brief, subtle, and perceived as texture changes or slight vibrations – *not* distracting. Pulse amplitude and frequency are dynamically adjusted based on the interference level and user preference.
    *   **Dynamic Calibration:** Implement a calibration routine to adapt to variations in manufacturing, environmental conditions, and user touch pressure.
    *   **User Profile Integration:** Allow users to customize the haptic feedback intensity and type.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    interferenceEvent = detectInterference();

    if (interferenceEvent != null) {
        affectedArea = predictAffectedArea(interferenceEvent);
        interferenceLevel = assessInterferenceLevel(interferenceEvent);

        hapticPulse = generateHapticPulse(interferenceLevel);

        applyHapticPulse(affectedArea, hapticPulse);
    }
}

// Function: generateHapticPulse(interferenceLevel)
function generateHapticPulse(interferenceLevel) {
    // Map interference level to pulse amplitude and frequency.
    // Use a lookup table or a mathematical function.
    amplitude = map(interferenceLevel, 0, 100, 0, 50);
    frequency = map(interferenceLevel, 0, 100, 100, 500);

    return {amplitude: amplitude, frequency: frequency};
}

// Function: applyHapticPulse(affectedArea, hapticPulse)
function applyHapticPulse(affectedArea, hapticPulse) {
    // Activate the haptic actuators in the affected area with the specified amplitude and frequency.
    for each pixel in affectedArea {
        activateActuator(pixel, hapticPulse.amplitude, hapticPulse.frequency);
    }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved touch accuracy and responsiveness in the presence of interference.
*   Reduced need for aggressive filtering or input discarding.
*   Novel user experience through subtle haptic feedback.
*   Potential to create ‘virtual textures’ by dynamically modulating haptic feedback.
