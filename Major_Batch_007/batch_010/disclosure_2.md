## Dynamic Network Personality Injection

**Concept:** Extend the virtual network authorization and communication management to incorporate "Network Personalities" – configurable profiles that dynamically alter network behavior based on communication content, sender/receiver roles, or time-based rules. This moves beyond simple authorization to proactive network *shaping*.

**Specifications:**

**1. Personality Definition Module:**

*   **Input:** YAML/JSON configuration files defining network personalities.  Example:
    ```yaml
    personality_name: "HighPriority_Engineering"
    priority: 9
    qoS_marking: "EF" # Expedited Forwarding
    encryption_level: "AES256"
    allowed_protocols: ["TCP", "UDP", "QUIC"]
    blocked_ports: [25, 119] # SMTP, NNTP
    content_filters: #Regex patterns for content inspection
        - pattern: "CONFIDENTIAL"
          action: "log_and_alert"
        - pattern: "CRITICAL_ERROR"
          action: "reroute_to_monitoring"
    time_window: #Optional. Schedule.
        start: "09:00"
        end: "17:00"
    ```
*   **Output:** Compiled personality profiles stored in a key-value database (e.g., Redis, etcd) for fast retrieval.

**2. Communication Interception & Personality Matching:**

*   Integration point: Within the existing communication manager module (as described in the patent).
*   Process:
    1.  Receive communication.
    2.  Extract metadata (source/destination virtual addresses, ports, protocols, initial payload).
    3.  Query personality database for matching profiles. Matching criteria:
        *   Virtual network address ranges.
        *   Sender/receiver roles (configurable tags).
        *   Time of day.
        *   Content inspection (initial payload scan – limited to avoid latency).
    4.  If multiple personalities match, select based on priority.

**3. Dynamic Network Shaping Engine:**

*   Core component responsible for applying personality rules to communications.
*   Capabilities:
    *   **QoS Marking:** Apply DSCP values for prioritized traffic handling.
    *   **Encryption/Decryption:** Dynamically enable/disable encryption based on profile.
    *   **Protocol Filtering:** Block or allow specific protocols.
    *   **Port Filtering:** Block or allow specific ports.
    *   **Content Inspection & Action:** Trigger actions based on content (logging, alerting, rerouting, deep packet inspection).
    *   **Traffic Mirroring:** Duplicate traffic for analysis.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit bandwidth for specific communications.
*   Implementation: Leverages existing network virtualization technologies (e.g., SR-IOV, DPDK) for high performance.

**4. Personality Management API:**

*   RESTful API for creating, updating, and deleting network personalities.
*   Authentication/authorization required.
*   API endpoints:
    *   `/personalities`: GET (list), POST (create)
    *   `/personalities/{id}`: GET (read), PUT (update), DELETE (delete)
    *   `/personalities/{id}/apply`: POST (apply personality to a specific communication – for testing/debugging)

**Pseudocode – Communication Flow:**

```
function processCommunication(communication):
  metadata = extractMetadata(communication)
  matchingPersonalities = queryPersonalityDatabase(metadata)
  if matchingPersonalities:
    personality = selectHighestPriorityPersonality(matchingPersonalities)
    modifiedCommunication = applyPersonalityRules(communication, personality)
  else:
    modifiedCommunication = communication // Use default rules

  sendCommunication(modifiedCommunication)
```

**Novelty:**

Existing network virtualization solutions focus on static network policies and quality of service. This system introduces a dynamic layer that *actively shapes* network behavior based on communication content and context. It is not merely an authorization mechanism; it's a real-time network adaptation system. It provides an additional layer of isolation and control beyond what existing solutions can offer.
