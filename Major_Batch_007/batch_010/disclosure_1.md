## Adaptive Sensory Augmentation System

**Concept:** Expand the user state detection beyond sleep/wake to include nuanced emotional and cognitive states, and *actively* augment the user’s sensory input to optimize their experience – not just minimize disturbance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Spectral Camera Array:** Integrated front-facing camera system with:
    *   Visible Light Camera (standard RGB).
    *   Near-Infrared (NIR) Camera (for retinal reflection & subtle facial muscle movement).
    *   Thermal Camera (for skin temperature mapping and subtle physiological changes).
    *   Polarized Light Filter (to detect stress indicators on skin).
*   **Bio-Impedance Sensors:** Incorporated into device housing (grip points/edges) to measure skin conductance (GSR) for emotional arousal.
*   **Micro-Haptic Actuators:** Array of micro-actuators integrated into device housing for subtle tactile feedback.
*   **Bone Conduction Transducers:** Integrated for directional audio cues bypassing traditional speakers.
*   **Ambient Environmental Sensors**: Microphone array, barometer, and light sensors to capture environmental context.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **State Estimation Engine:** A multi-modal AI model combining data from all sensors. Inputs include:
    *   Facial expression analysis (micro-expressions).
    *   Pupil dilation and retinal reflection patterns.
    *   Skin conductance (GSR).
    *   Skin temperature mapping.
    *   Environmental audio and visual context.
*   **Sensory Modulation Profiles:** Pre-defined and user-customizable profiles mapping estimated user states to specific sensory adjustments. Examples:
    *   **Focus Mode:**  Subtle blue light emission from the screen (enhancing alertness), directional bone conduction audio providing white noise, and micro-haptic pulses on the grip to maintain attention.
    *   **Relaxation Mode:** Warm color temperature screen adjustments, calming ambient audio, and gentle haptic vibrations mimicking slow breathing patterns.
    *   **Creative Flow State:** Dynamic adjustments to screen brightness and color saturation based on detected physiological markers of creativity (e.g., alpha brainwave activity correlated with thermal signatures).
    *    **Social Calibration Mode:** Subtle haptic cues to indicate social proximity and potentially modulate communication style (e.g. a gentle vibration when the user is speaking too loudly).
*   **Adaptive Learning Engine:** AI-powered system that learns user preferences and optimizes sensory modulation profiles over time.
*   **API Access:** Allow third-party applications to integrate with the Adaptive Sensory Augmentation System.

**3. Functional Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (device is ON) {
  sensorData = captureSensorData();
  userState = estimateUserState(sensorData);

  modulationProfile = selectModulationProfile(userState);

  applyModulationProfile(modulationProfile);
  logData(userState, modulationProfile);
}

// estimateUserState(sensorData)
function estimateUserState(sensorData) {
  // Analyze facial expressions, pupil dilation, GSR, thermal data, environmental context
  emotionalState = analyzeEmotionalState(sensorData);
  cognitiveLoad = assessCognitiveLoad(sensorData);
  attentionLevel = determineAttentionLevel(sensorData);

  // Combine all data to estimate overall user state
  userState = {
    emotionalState: emotionalState,
    cognitiveLoad: cognitiveLoad,
    attentionLevel: attentionLevel
  };

  return userState;
}

// applyModulationProfile(modulationProfile)
function applyModulationProfile(modulationProfile) {
  // Adjust screen brightness, color temperature, audio output, haptic feedback
  screen.brightness = modulationProfile.screenBrightness;
  screen.colorTemperature = modulationProfile.screenColorTemperature;
  audio.volume = modulationProfile.audioVolume;
  haptics.pattern = modulationProfile.hapticPattern;
}
```

**4. User Interface Elements:**

*   **State Visualization:** Discreet visual indicator (e.g., a subtle color change on device edge) showing current estimated user state.
*   **Profile Customization:**  UI for creating and editing sensory modulation profiles.
*   **Data Logging Control:** Option to enable/disable data logging for privacy.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Guided process for calibrating sensors to individual user characteristics.
