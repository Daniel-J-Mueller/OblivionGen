## Automated Workspace Reconfiguration System

**Concept:** Expand the mobile drive unit's capabilities beyond simple inventory transport to full workspace reconfiguration, adapting the physical layout dynamically based on task requirements.

**System Specs:**

*   **Mobile Reconfiguration Unit (MRU):**
    *   Dimensions: 60cm x 60cm x 30cm (adjustable height via telescoping legs).
    *   Drive System: Omnidirectional wheels (minimum 4), independently controlled. Max speed 1 m/s.
    *   Lifting Capacity: 50kg (modular attachment points for various end-effectors).
    *   Power: High-capacity battery pack (replaceable/inductive charging). Runtime: 8 hours.
    *   Sensors:
        *   High-resolution depth camera (Intel RealSense or similar).
        *   LiDAR for precise 3D mapping.
        *   IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for accurate positioning.
        *   Force/torque sensors on end-effector attachment points.
    *   Communication: Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2.
*   **End-Effectors (Modular, Interchangeable):**
    *   **Universal Gripper:** For manipulating a variety of objects.
    *   **Magnetic Attachment:** For steel-based objects and surfaces.
    *   **Vacuum Suction Cup:** For smooth, flat surfaces.
    *   **Pin/Peg Insertion/Extraction Tool:** For connecting/disconnecting modular workspace elements.
    *   **Small Robotic Arm (6DoF):** For precision tasks.
*   **Modular Workspace Elements:**
    *   Lightweight panels (e.g., polycarbonate, composite materials) with standardized connection points (pins, pegs, magnetic interfaces).
    *   Adjustable height legs/supports for panels.
    *   Modular shelving units.
    *   Mobile workbenches.
*   **Central Control System:**
    *   Real-time workspace map based on sensor data from MRUs.
    *   Task planning algorithm: receives high-level task requests (e.g., “create an assembly area,” “reconfigure for quality inspection”) and generates optimal reconfiguration plans.
    *   Collision avoidance system.
    *   Remote monitoring and control interface.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION ReconfigureWorkspace(taskRequest)
    workspaceMap = GetCurrentWorkspaceMap()
    reconfigurationPlan = GenerateReconfigurationPlan(taskRequest, workspaceMap)

    FOR EACH step IN reconfigurationPlan
        IF step.action == "MOVE_PANEL"
            MRU = FindAvailableMRU()
            AttachEndEffector(MRU, "Gripper")
            NavigateTo(MRU, step.sourceLocation)
            GripPanel(MRU, step.panelID)
            NavigateTo(MRU, step.destinationLocation)
            ReleasePanel(MRU)
        ELSE IF step.action == "ADJUST_HEIGHT"
            MRU = FindAvailableMRU()
            AttachEndEffector(MRU, "AdjustableLegControl") // Specialized end-effector for leg adjustment
            NavigateTo(MRU, step.legLocation)
            AdjustLegHeight(MRU, step.targetHeight)
        ELSE IF step.action == "MOVE_WORKBENCH"
            // Similar logic to MOVE_PANEL, utilizing appropriate end-effector
        END IF
    END FOR

    UpdateWorkspaceMap()
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond inventory transport to dynamic workspace *reconfiguration*.  Instead of just moving *items*, it physically *restructures* the work environment, adapting it on demand.  The modularity and automated planning create a truly flexible and responsive workspace.
