## Bio-Acoustic Resonance Earbud - "Aura"

**Concept:** An earbud that subtly alters perceived sound based on biometric data – specifically, galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate variability (HRV) – to enhance focus, relaxation, or emotional engagement with music.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrated GSR sensor (contact point on inner ear cartilage) & Photoplethysmography (PPG) heart rate sensor (integrated into earbud housing, making contact with tragus).
*   **Microcontroller:** Low-power ARM Cortex-M4 processor for real-time data processing.
*   **Audio Processing Unit (APU):** Dedicated digital signal processor (DSP) for dynamic audio manipulation.
*   **Audio Drivers:** Balanced armature drivers with frequency response tailored for detailed sound reproduction.
*   **Connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio support.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable lithium-ion battery (2+ hours runtime). Wireless charging capable.
*   **Materials:** Bio-compatible silicone ear tips. Magnesium alloy housing.
*   **Form Factor:**  A departure from typical in-ear designs.  The "Aura" will have a semi-open design, resting *around* the ear canal rather than sealing it, enhancing awareness of ambient sounds.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Biometric Data Acquisition:** Continuous monitoring of GSR & HRV.
2.  **Emotional State Inference:**  Algorithm to estimate user's emotional state (e.g., stressed, relaxed, focused) based on biometric data.
3.  **Dynamic Audio Profile Selection/Creation:**
    *   **Pre-set Profiles:** 'Focus', 'Relax', 'Energize' – each adjusting EQ, spatial audio, and subtle harmonic alterations.
    *   **Adaptive Profile:** Dynamically adjusts audio parameters based on real-time emotional state.
4.  **Audio Manipulation Techniques:**
    *   **EQ Adjustment:** Subtle frequency boosting or attenuation to accentuate/de-emphasize specific musical elements.
    *   **Spatial Audio Enhancement:** Dynamic head tracking and spatialization to create a more immersive soundscape.
    *   **Binaural Beats/Isochronic Tones:** Integration of low-frequency binaural beats or isochronic tones, subtly layered within the music.
    *   **Harmonic Alteration:** Micro-adjustments to harmonic content to evoke specific emotional responses (e.g., adding warmth/brightness).
5.  **User Control:** Companion mobile app for personalization (sensitivity levels, profile customization, and data visualization).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop

while (true) {
    // Read GSR and HRV data
    gsrValue = readGSR();
    hrvValue = readHRV();

    // Infer emotional state
    emotionalState = inferEmotionalState(gsrValue, hrvValue);

    // Select appropriate audio profile
    audioProfile = selectAudioProfile(emotionalState);

    // Apply audio processing based on selected profile
    applyAudioProcessing(audioProfile);

    // Play audio
    playAudio();
}

// Function: inferEmotionalState
function inferEmotionalState(gsr, hrv) {
  // Simplified logic - replace with machine learning model
  if (gsr > thresholdHigh && hrv < thresholdLow) {
    return "Stressed";
  } else if (gsr < thresholdLow && hrv > thresholdHigh) {
    return "Relaxed";
  } else {
    return "Neutral";
  }
}

// Function: selectAudioProfile
function selectAudioProfile(state) {
    if (state == "Stressed") {
        return "Relax";
    } else if (state == "Relaxed") {
        return "Focus";
    } else {
        return "Neutral";
    }
}

// Function: applyAudioProcessing
function applyAudioProcessing(profile) {
    // EQ, Spatial Audio, Binaural Beats/Isochronic Tones, Harmonic Alteration
}
```
