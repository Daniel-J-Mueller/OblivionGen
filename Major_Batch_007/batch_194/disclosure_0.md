## Dynamic Character Archetype Generation & Cross-Media Consistency

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple voice assignment to create dynamically generated character archetypes that influence not just audio presentation, but also visual style, musical themes, and even potential plot suggestions, maintaining consistency across multiple media formats (text, audio, video, game).

**Specs:**

**1. Archetype Core:**

*   **Data Structure:** JSON-based "Archetype" object.
    *   `archetype_name`: (String) e.g., "Stoic Warrior", "Cunning Rogue", "Eccentric Scholar".  Pre-defined list, expandable.
    *   `primary_attribute`: (Enum) Gender, Age, Ethnicity, Socioeconomic Class, Tribe, Caste (as in patent)
    *   `secondary_attributes`: (Array of Strings) Traits like "brave", "intelligent", "ambitious", "melancholy", etc.  Controlled vocabulary, weighted.
    *   `visual_style_guide`: (Object)
        *   `color_palette`: (Array of Hex Codes) Dominant colors for character depiction.
        *   `clothing_style`: (String) e.g., "Medieval Knight", "Victorian Gentleman", "Cyberpunk Hacker".
        *   `facial_features`: (Object)  Parameters for facial generation (age, wrinkles, eye shape, etc.).
    *   `audio_profile`: (Object)
        *   `voice_type`: (Enum) Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass, etc.
        *   `tone`: (Enum) Warm, Cold, Neutral, etc.
        *   `pacing`: (Float) Words per minute.
        *   `emotional_range`: (Float) 0-1.  Affects expressiveness.
    *   `musical_theme`: (Object)
        *   `instrumentation`: (Array of Strings) Instruments used in character theme.
        *   `key`: (String) e.g., "C Major", "A Minor".
        *   `tempo`: (Integer) Beats per minute.
    *   `plot_tendencies`: (Array of Strings) Preferred plot elements: "investigation", "revenge", "redemption", "discovery".
*   **Archetype Library:** Database of pre-defined Archetypes, continually expanding.  User-editable.

**2. Dynamic Archetype Assignment & Refinement:**

*   **Initial Assignment:**
    *   Analyze character description in the work.
    *   Utilize NLP to extract attributes (gender, age, etc.).
    *   Map extracted attributes to Archetypes in the library.
    *   Present top 3-5 Archetype suggestions to the user.
*   **User Refinement:**
    *   User selects an Archetype.
    *   User can manually adjust Archetype attributes (e.g., change "brave" to "reckless").
*   **Cross-Media Application:**
    *   Text-to-Speech: Utilize `audio_profile` to select/synthesize voice.
    *   Image/Video Generation: Utilize `visual_style_guide` to guide character depiction.
    *   Music Generation: Generate musical theme based on `musical_theme`.
    *   Plot Suggestion: Generate potential plot points based on `plot_tendencies`.

**3.  Inter-Work Consistency:**

*   **Character ID:** Unique identifier assigned to each character.
*   **Archetype Storage:**  Archetype assigned to a character is stored with the character ID.
*   **Cross-Work Application:**
    *   When a character appears in a new work, the system automatically applies the stored Archetype.
    *   This ensures consistent character presentation across all media.
    *   The user can override the stored Archetype if desired.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function assign_archetype(character_description):
  attributes = extract_attributes(character_description)
  suggested_archetypes = search_archetype_library(attributes)
  present_archetypes_to_user(suggested_archetypes)
  selected_archetype = get_user_selection()
  return selected_archetype

function apply_archetype(character, archetype):
  character.voice = archetype.audio_profile.voice_type
  character.visual_style = archetype.visual_style_guide
  character.theme = archetype.musical_theme
  # ... other applications

function generate_plot_point(character):
  plot_tendency = random_choice(character.archetype.plot_tendencies)
  # ... generate plot point based on tendency

```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond voice selection to create a holistic character representation that can be applied across multiple media. The inter-work consistency feature ensures that characters remain consistent even when they appear in different stories. This allows for richer, more immersive storytelling experiences.
