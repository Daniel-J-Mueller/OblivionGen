## Dynamic Label Clustering & Hierarchy

**Concept:** Extend the label placement system to dynamically cluster labels based on proximity and semantic relationship, then present them in a hierarchical view for user interaction. This moves beyond simply *placing* a label to managing a *system* of labels.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `LabelNode`: Represents a single label. Contains:
    *   `label_text`: String. The label's text content.
    *   `feature_id`: Integer. ID of the geographic feature the label describes.
    *   `coordinates`: (Float, Float). Geographic coordinates of the label's placement.
    *   `score`: Float. The original placement score (from the existing patent system).
    *   `cluster_id`: Integer. ID of the cluster this label belongs to.
    *   `parent_cluster_id`: Integer. ID of the parent cluster (for hierarchical structure).
*   `Cluster`: Represents a cluster of labels. Contains:
    *   `cluster_id`: Integer. Unique ID for the cluster.
    *   `centroid`: (Float, Float). Geographic coordinates of the cluster's center.
    *   `member_labels`: List of `LabelNode` objects belonging to this cluster.
    *   `summary_text`: String. Automatically generated summary of the cluster's content (e.g., "3 Restaurants, 2 Hotels").

**2. Algorithm – Cluster Generation:**

1.  **Initial Clustering:**  After initial label placement scoring (as in the provided patent), apply a density-based clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN) to `LabelNode` objects based on proximity (geographic distance).  Parameters for DBSCAN (epsilon, min_points) would be adjustable.
2.  **Semantic Enrichment:**  Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze `label_text` and assign semantic categories to each label (e.g., "Restaurant", "Hotel", "Park", "Road"). This enables grouping beyond simple proximity.
3.  **Hybrid Clustering:**  Combine proximity and semantic similarity for clustering. Labels close to each other *and* belonging to the same semantic category are strongly grouped.  Adjustable weighting between proximity and semantic similarity.
4.  **Hierarchical Construction:**  Recursively merge clusters based on proximity of their centroids *and* similarity of their semantic profiles. Stop merging when clusters become too large or dissimilar. This forms the hierarchical structure.

**3. Algorithm – User Interaction & Display:**

1.  **Map Display:** Display the map with initial labels placed as in the original patent.
2.  **Cluster Visualization:**  Display clusters as follows:
    *   **Zoom Out:**  Display only cluster centroids. The cluster centroid label should indicate the number of labels within that cluster (e.g., "Restaurants (12)").
    *   **Zoom In (Level 1):** Display cluster centroids with a pop-up window showing a summary of the cluster (e.g., "3 Restaurants, 2 Hotels").
    *   **Zoom In (Level 2):** Display individual labels within the current cluster, placed according to the original patent's algorithm.
3.  **User Navigation:** Allow the user to:
    *   Navigate the cluster hierarchy (zoom in/out).
    *   Filter clusters based on semantic category.
    *   Highlight specific clusters.
    *   Request details on individual labels within a cluster.

**4. Pseudocode – Cluster Hierarchy Navigation:**

```
function navigate_cluster_hierarchy(map, cluster_id, zoom_level):
  if zoom_level == 0:
    display_cluster_centroids(map, cluster_id)
  else if zoom_level == 1:
    display_cluster_summary(map, cluster_id)
  else if zoom_level == 2:
    display_labels_in_cluster(map, cluster_id)
  else:
    //Handle edge cases/errors

function display_labels_in_cluster(map, cluster_id):
  for label in get_labels_from_cluster(cluster_id):
    place_label_on_map(map, label)

function place_label_on_map(map, label):
  //Use original patent's label placement algorithm
  //Place label on map at calculated coordinates
```

**5. Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires significant processing power for NLP and clustering, particularly with large datasets.
*   Consider using a tile-based map rendering engine to optimize performance.
*   Requires a robust database to store label data, cluster information, and semantic categories.
*   Integration with existing map APIs (e.g., Mapbox, Google Maps) would be beneficial.
