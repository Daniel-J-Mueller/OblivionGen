**Automated Question Re-Framing & Contextual Expansion**

**Specification:**

**System Name:** Context Weaver

**Core Function:** Dynamically re-frame unanswered questions identified in a primary discussion forum, expanding the contextual information before posting to a secondary forum.

**Components:**

1.  **Question Analyzer:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) module.
    *   Input: Unanswered question text (from primary forum).
    *   Process:
        *   Entity Recognition: Identify key entities (topics, products, concepts) within the question.
        *   Intent Classification: Determine the user’s underlying goal (e.g., troubleshooting, seeking recommendations, requesting explanation).
        *   Knowledge Graph Integration: Utilize a knowledge graph to find related concepts and information.  (e.g., if the question is about "error code 123", the knowledge graph pulls in related documentation, known solutions, similar error codes).
        *   Missing Context Detection: Identify potentially missing information that would aid in answering the question (e.g., operating system version, software build number, specific hardware model).
2.  **Context Expansion Engine:**
    *   Input: Original question + output from Question Analyzer.
    *   Process:
        *   Automatic Prompt Generation: Craft prompts to external information sources (e.g., knowledge bases, documentation servers, APIs).
        *   Information Retrieval: Retrieve relevant information based on generated prompts.
        *   Contextual Insertion: Seamlessly integrate retrieved information into the original question *before* posting to the secondary forum.  This can include:
            *   Adding a preamble explaining the user’s setup (e.g., “I’m running version X of software Y on operating system Z”).
            *   Including relevant error messages or log snippets.
            *   Linking to related documentation or forum threads.
3.  **Secondary Forum Poster:**  Interface to post expanded question to determined secondary forum.
4.  **Response Tracker:** Monitors the secondary forum for responses to the expanded question.

**Pseudocode (Context Expansion Engine):**

```
FUNCTION expand_question(question_text):
  analyzer = QuestionAnalyzer()
  analysis_result = analyzer.analyze(question_text)

  missing_context = analysis_result.missing_context
  related_entities = analysis_result.related_entities

  expanded_question = question_text

  IF missing_context:
    FOR context_item IN missing_context:
      prompt = generate_prompt(context_item, related_entities)
      retrieved_info = retrieve_information(prompt)
      expanded_question = expanded_question + "\n\nAdditional Context: " + retrieved_info

  IF related_entities:
    expanded_question = expanded_question + "\n\nRelated Concepts: " + join(related_entities, ", ")

  RETURN expanded_question
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Knowledge Graph (containing entities, relationships, and attributes).
*   Access to relevant documentation and information sources.
*   API access to secondary discussion forums.

**Innovation Focus:** This departs from simple question forwarding by proactively enriching the question with relevant context *before* seeking assistance. This increases the likelihood of a successful answer and reduces the back-and-forth required for clarification. It shifts the focus from 'finding someone who knows the answer' to 'presenting the question in a way that makes it easy to answer'.
