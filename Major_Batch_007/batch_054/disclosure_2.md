## Autonomous Mobile Device - Predictive Gaze & Intent Mapping

**Concept:** Expand the AMD's awareness beyond simply tracking a user's location *within* the visual frame, to predicting where the user will *look* and what they might *interact* with, preemptively adjusting the AMD’s position and camera focus. This moves from reactive tracking to proactive assistance.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Depth Sensor:** High-resolution time-of-flight (ToF) sensor for creating a detailed 3D map of the environment. Range: 0.5m – 10m. Resolution: 512x512.
*   **Eye-Tracking Camera:** Integrated low-latency, high-accuracy eye-tracking camera embedded within the AMD’s primary camera system. Sampling Rate: 60Hz. Accuracy: <1° of visual angle.
*   **Environmental Mapping Module:** Dedicated processing unit for real-time environmental mapping and object recognition. Minimum processing power: 1 TFLOPS.
*   **Predictive AI Accelerator:**  Dedicated neural processing unit optimized for running lightweight predictive models.
*   **Actuator System:** Existing pan/tilt/zoom mechanism. Addition of a micro-robotic arm with a small, high-resolution display screen. Arm reach: 30cm. Display Resolution: 1920x1080.

**Software Architecture:**

1.  **Environmental Mapping:**
    *   Input: Depth sensor data.
    *   Process: Create a dynamic 3D map of the environment. Identify and categorize objects (e.g., furniture, doorways, appliances).
    *   Output: Semantic map data.
2.  **Gaze Tracking & Prediction:**
    *   Input: Eye-tracking camera data.
    *   Process: Determine the user’s point of gaze in 3D space. Implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to predict future gaze points based on past gaze history and environmental context.
    *   Output: Predicted gaze point (x, y, z coordinates) with confidence score.
3.  **Intent Recognition:**
    *   Input: Predicted gaze point, environmental map data, user’s movement history.
    *   Process: Employ a classification model (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Random Forest) to predict the user's likely intent based on their gaze and environmental context. (e.g., if the user is looking at a light switch, the likely intent is to turn on the light).
    *   Output: Predicted intent (e.g., "turn on light," "open door," "inspect object") with confidence score.
4.  **AMD Control System:**
    *   Input: Predicted gaze point, predicted intent, environmental map data.
    *   Process:
        *   **Positioning:**  Adjust the AMD’s position to provide the optimal viewing angle for the predicted gaze point.
        *   **Camera Control:** Automatically focus the camera on the object of interest.
        *   **Interactive Display:** If the predicted intent involves interacting with an object, activate the micro-robotic arm and display relevant information or controls on the attached screen. (e.g., display a virtual slider for controlling the brightness of a light).
    *   Output: Control signals for the AMD’s actuators and camera.

**Pseudocode (AMD Control System):**

```
FUNCTION ControlAMD(predicted_gaze, predicted_intent, environmental_map)

    // Calculate optimal AMD position based on predicted gaze
    optimal_position = CalculateOptimalPosition(predicted_gaze, environmental_map)

    // Move AMD to optimal position
    MoveAMD(optimal_position)

    // Adjust camera focus
    AdjustCameraFocus(predicted_gaze)

    // Handle potential interactions
    IF predicted_intent == "turn on light" THEN
        DisplayVirtualControls("light_brightness", "light_on_off")
    ELSE IF predicted_intent == "inspect object" THEN
        DisplayObjectInformation(environmental_map)
    END IF

END FUNCTION
```

**Calibration & Learning:**

*   Initial calibration: User-guided calibration to establish a baseline for eye-tracking accuracy and environmental mapping.
*   Continuous learning: The system will continuously refine its predictive models based on user interactions and feedback.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Accessibility for visually impaired users.
*   Hands-free control of smart home devices.
*   Enhanced productivity and efficiency in various work environments.
*   Immersive AR/VR experiences.
