## Modular Strut Channel Ecosystem with Integrated Environmental Sensing

**Concept:** Expand the functionality of the strut channel lighting system beyond illumination to create a fully integrated environmental monitoring and control ecosystem. This moves beyond simple lighting fixtures *within* the channel to a system *of* modules operating *through* the channel.

**Specifications:**

**1. Module Types:**

*   **Lighting Module:** (Existing functionality â€“ enhanced with tunable white/RGB LEDs) - Dimensions: Standard strut channel compatible (e.g., 1-5/8" x 1-5/8"). Power: 24VDC, standardized connector. Communication: Zigbee/Thread.
*   **Environmental Sensor Module:**  Integrated sensors for temperature, humidity, CO2, VOCs, particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10), and ambient light. Dimensions:  Standard strut channel compatible. Power:  24VDC (powered via channel). Communication: Zigbee/Thread. Data logging to onboard SD card (backup).
*   **Actuator Module (Dampening):**  Small, low-power Peltier device for localized temperature control. Targeted at reducing condensation in enclosed spaces. Power: 24VDC, 5-10W. Communication: Zigbee/Thread.
*   **Actuator Module (Acoustic):** Miniature sound dampening/noise cancellation module employing MEMS technology. Can be programmed for specific frequency ranges. Power: 24VDC, 3-5W. Communication: Zigbee/Thread.
*   **Power/Data Distribution Module:**  Provides localized power distribution (24VDC) and data backhaul via PoE (Power over Ethernet) utilizing the strut channel as a conduit.  Incorporates a small Ethernet switch.
*   **Wireless Gateway Module:**  Connects the entire system to a local network (Wi-Fi, Ethernet) and cloud services.

**2. Strut Channel Modifications:**

*   **Integrated Wiring Channel:**  The strut channel itself will incorporate a secondary, shielded channel running along its length for wiring (power, data).
*   **Standardized Mounting Points:**  Precise, standardized mounting points along the channel for modules.  Quick-release mechanism for easy installation/removal.
*   **Thermal Management:**  Channel material will incorporate improved thermal conductivity to aid in heat dissipation from modules.

**3. Communication Protocol:**

*   **Zigbee/Thread Mesh Network:** Modules communicate with each other and the gateway via a robust, self-healing mesh network.
*   **MQTT:**  Data is transmitted to the cloud using the MQTT protocol.
*   **Local Control:**  Modules can operate autonomously even if the network connection is lost.

**4. Software/User Interface:**

*   **Cloud Dashboard:**  Web-based dashboard for monitoring sensor data, controlling actuators, and configuring the system.
*   **Mobile App:**  Mobile app for remote access and control.
*   **API:**  Open API for integration with third-party applications.
*   **Rule Engine:**  Allows users to create custom rules for automated control (e.g., turn on a fan if the temperature exceeds a certain threshold).

**Pseudocode (Rule Engine Example):**

```
IF SensorModule.Temperature > 25 AND ActuatorModule.Fan.State == OFF THEN
    ActuatorModule.Fan.TurnOn()
END IF

IF SensorModule.CO2 > 800 THEN
    SendAlert("High CO2 levels detected")
END IF
```

**5. Power Considerations:**

*   **24VDC:**  Standardized low-voltage DC power distribution.
*   **PoE:**  Power over Ethernet for the gateway and potentially high-power modules.
*   **Distributed Power:**  Multiple power injection points along the channel.

**Scalability:** The system is designed to be highly scalable. Users can add or remove modules as needed to meet their specific requirements.  Modules can be combined to create custom solutions for a wide range of applications.  This system effectively transforms the standard strut channel into a versatile, intelligent infrastructure component.
