## Dynamic Item ‘Ecosystem’ Visualization & Interaction

**Concept:** Expand the diversity criteria beyond category/feature limitations to model items as existing within a dynamic 'ecosystem' where relationships aren’t predetermined, but *discovered* through user interaction and external data feeds. This goes beyond simply diversifying *what* is presented, to diversifying the *perceived relationships* between items.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Ecosystem Graph Construction:**
    *   Data Sources: Item metadata (category, features), user interaction data (views, purchases, ‘related item’ clicks), external knowledge graphs (e.g., Wikidata, product review sentiment analysis – identifying commonly co-mentioned items even across categories).
    *   Node Representation: Each item is a node in a graph.
    *   Edge Creation: Edges represent ‘relationships’ between items. Relationship strength is dynamically calculated based on:
        *   Co-occurrence in user sessions.
        *   Shared features (weighted by feature importance).
        *   Sentiment co-mention in reviews (positive/negative association).
        *   Knowledge graph links (derived relationships).
        *   Temporal decay (recent interactions weigh more).

2.  **Diversity Metric – ‘Ecosystem Coverage’:**
    *   Define ‘Ecosystem Coverage’ as a measure of how well the presented items sample different *sub-ecosystems* within the larger graph.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   Identify strongly connected components (sub-ecosystems) within the graph.
        *   Assign weights to sub-ecosystems based on size and user engagement.
        *   Diversity score is calculated by maximizing the number of distinct, high-weight sub-ecosystems represented in the presented list.

3.  **Interactive Visualization & Exploration:**
    *   User Interface: Present the recommended list *with* a simplified visualization of the item ecosystem.
    *   Functionality:
        *   Clicking on an item highlights its immediate connections in the ecosystem.
        *   Users can ‘explore’ related items, expanding the visualization.
        *   Users can ‘seed’ the ecosystem with a specific interest (e.g., ‘hiking boots’), and the system will prioritize displaying items connected to that seed.
        *   The system learns user exploration patterns to refine the ecosystem graph and improve recommendations.

4.  **Recommendation Engine Integration:**
    *   Modify the existing profitability/diversity ranking algorithm to incorporate ‘Ecosystem Coverage’ as a primary diversity criterion.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   Iteratively select items for the recommendation list.
        *   At each step, prioritize items that:
            *   Have high profitability.
            *   Increase ‘Ecosystem Coverage’.
            *   Minimize overlap with already selected items (based on graph distance).

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Engine Update):**

```
function generate_recommendation_list(first_ordered_list, user_data, diversity_criteria):
  // Initialize recommendation list
  recommendation_list = []
  // Build ecosystem graph from items
  ecosystem_graph = build_ecosystem_graph(first_ordered_list)

  while length(recommendation_list) < target_list_size:
    best_item = null
    best_score = -1

    for item in first_ordered_list:
      if item not in recommendation_list:
        // Calculate score based on profitability, diversity, and graph distance
        profitability_score = item.profitability
        diversity_score = calculate_diversity_contribution(item, recommendation_list, ecosystem_graph)
        graph_distance_penalty = calculate_average_distance_to_existing_items(item, recommendation_list, ecosystem_graph)

        total_score = profitability_score * weight_profitability + diversity_score * weight_diversity - graph_distance_penalty * weight_distance

        if total_score > best_score:
          best_score = total_score
          best_item = item

    if best_item:
      recommendation_list.append(best_item)
    else:
      // No suitable item found - break loop
      break

  return recommendation_list
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Personalized Ecosystems: Build separate ecosystem graphs for each user based on their interaction history.
*   Dynamic Graph Updates: Continuously update the ecosystem graph based on real-time user interactions and external data feeds.
*   Explainable AI: Provide users with explanations of *why* certain items are being recommended based on their connections in the ecosystem.
