## Quantum Error Mitigation via Entanglement Swapping & Dynamic Graph Reconstruction

**Concept:** Enhance error mitigation in distributed quantum computation not by solely weighting results from individual quantum computers, but by dynamically reconstructing entanglement across the network *during* computation using entanglement swapping. This addresses errors stemming from qubit decoherence and gate infidelity *as they occur*, rather than post-hoc through statistical aggregation.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires a network of interconnected quantum computers (as outlined in the patent), each capable of performing Bell-state measurements and remote state preparation. Each quantum computer must have dedicated communication channels (e.g., photonic links, microwave connections) for entanglement distribution and classical control signals.
*   **Software:** A central control system managing the entanglement swapping protocol, error detection, and dynamic graph reconstruction. This system utilizes real-time qubit fidelity data (obtained via calibration routines) to inform graph modifications.
*   **Qubit Management:** Each quantum computer maintains a pool of "entanglement qubits" dedicated to facilitating entanglement swapping. These qubits are physically separate from those used in the primary computation.
*   **Error Detection Module:** Each quantum computer incorporates a module for continuously monitoring qubit coherence and gate fidelity. This module provides feedback to the central control system.

**Protocol:**

1.  **Initial Entanglement Distribution:** Before the algorithm begins, establish initial entanglement links between neighboring quantum computers in the network. This can be done using standard entanglement distribution protocols (e.g., using photon pairs).
2.  **Algorithm Execution & Real-Time Monitoring:** Execute the quantum algorithm across the network. During execution, continuously monitor qubit coherence and gate fidelity on each quantum computer.
3.  **Error Detection & Triggering of Entanglement Swapping:** When the error detection module identifies a significant drop in qubit fidelity on a given quantum computer, trigger an entanglement swapping procedure.
4.  **Dynamic Graph Reconstruction:** The central control system identifies alternate computational paths that bypass the failing qubit(s). This involves performing Bell-state measurements on intermediate qubits to transfer the entangled state to healthy qubits. The network's computational graph is dynamically reconstructed to reflect this change.
5.  **Entanglement Swapping Procedure:**
    *   Identify a healthy “relay” quantum computer.
    *   Establish entanglement between the failing qubit and the relay qubit.
    *   Perform a Bell-state measurement on the relay qubit and the subsequent qubit in the computational path.
    *   The outcome of the Bell-state measurement projects the entanglement onto the new path, effectively "swapping" the entanglement.
6.  **Continuous Adaptation:** Repeat steps 3-5 throughout the algorithm execution, continuously adapting the computational graph to maintain entanglement and mitigate errors.

**Pseudocode (Entanglement Swapping Module):**

```
function SwapEntanglement(failingQubit, computationalPath, networkTopology):
  // Identify healthy relay qubit based on networkTopology and fidelity data
  relayQubit = FindBestRelayQubit(networkTopology, fidelityData)

  //Establish entanglement between failingQubit and relayQubit
  EstablishEntanglement(failingQubit, relayQubit)

  //Perform Bell-state measurement on relayQubit and next qubit in path
  measurementResult = PerformBellStateMeasurement(relayQubit, computationalPath.nextQubit())

  //Apply correction based on measurementResult
  ApplyCorrection(measurementResult, computationalPath)

  //Update computationalPath to reflect new entanglement
  UpdateComputationalPath(computationalPath, relayQubit)

  return computationalPath
```

**Calibration Data Requirements:**

*   Real-time qubit coherence times (T1, T2)
*   Gate fidelity measurements for all single and two-qubit gates
*   Network latency and bandwidth between quantum computers
*   Calibration data from the entanglement distribution module

**Novelty:**

This approach goes beyond simple result weighting by actively *repairing* entanglement during computation. By dynamically reconstructing the computational graph, the system can adapt to failing qubits and maintain a high degree of entanglement throughout the algorithm. This offers a potentially significant improvement in error mitigation compared to purely statistical methods. It is a proactive system of error repair.
