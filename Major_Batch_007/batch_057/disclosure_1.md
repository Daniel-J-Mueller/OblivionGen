## Dynamic Resource Record Weighting Based on Predictive Health

**Concept:** Instead of solely adjusting TTL based on *recent* health checks, proactively weight resource records (IP addresses) *before* a DNS response is sent, based on *predicted* health. This combines health check history with machine learning to anticipate failures *before* they occur, improving user experience and reducing load on failing servers.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Health Data Collection:** Gather historical health check data for each resource record (IP address) – including response times, error rates, and check intervals. Store this data in a time-series database.

2.  **Predictive Model Training:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA, or a simple regression model) for each resource record. The model will predict the probability of a future health check failure based on historical data.  Model retraining should occur periodically (e.g., daily, hourly) to adapt to changing conditions.

3.  **Weight Calculation:** Before constructing a DNS response, calculate a weight for each available resource record. The weight is derived from the predicted probability of success – higher probability = higher weight. A normalized weighting scheme (sum of weights = 1) should be used.

    *   `weight(resource_record) = 1 - predicted_failure_probability(resource_record)`
    *   Normalize weights across all available resource records for a given domain.

4.  **Weighted Random Selection:** Instead of a simple round-robin or random selection of resource records, use a weighted random selection algorithm.  This ensures that resource records with higher predicted success probabilities are more likely to be chosen.  

    *   Implement a weighted random selection function that takes an array of resource records and their associated weights as input.

5.  **Dynamic Adjustment & Feedback Loop:** Monitor connection success/failure rates to the selected resource records. Use this real-time feedback to refine the predictive models and weight calculations. 

    *   Implement a feedback loop that adjusts model parameters or weighting factors based on observed connection outcomes.

6.  **Configuration Options:** Provide configuration options for:

    *   Model selection (LSTM, ARIMA, Regression, etc.).
    *   Model retraining frequency.
    *   Weighting factor adjustments.
    *   Thresholds for triggering model retraining.
    *   Minimum/Maximum TTL values.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generate_dns_response(domain_name):
  resource_records = get_resource_records(domain_name)
  
  for record in resource_records:
    record.predicted_failure_probability = predict_failure_probability(record.ip_address)
    record.weight = 1 - record.predicted_failure_probability
    
  total_weight = sum(record.weight for record in resource_records)
  
  for record in resource_records:
    record.normalized_weight = record.weight / total_weight
  
  selected_record = weighted_random_select(resource_records)
  
  ttl = determine_ttl(selected_record) //Existing TTL determination logic from patent may be used as a base

  response = create_dns_response(domain_name, selected_record.ip_address, ttl)
  return response

function determine_ttl(selected_record):
  //Existing TTL logic from Patent
  //May be combined with health check age as input
  return ttl

function predict_failure_probability(ip_address):
  //Load historical health check data
  //Run ML model
  //Return predicted probability
  return probability
