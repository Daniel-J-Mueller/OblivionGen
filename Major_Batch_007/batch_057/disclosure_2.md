## Vehicle Pedal - Haptic Feedback & Biometric Integration

**Concept:** Integrate haptic feedback and biometric sensors *within* the pedal surface to provide real-time driving assistance and driver monitoring.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Pedal Surface Material:** Replace standard pedal material (rubber, metal) with a multi-layered composite.
    *   **Layer 1 (Top):**  Micro-structured, durable polymer with embedded piezoelectric actuators (array density: 100 actuators/cm²). This layer provides the tactile interface.
    *   **Layer 2:**  Force-sensitive resistor (FSR) grid.  Detects pressure distribution across the pedal surface. Resolution: 1mm².
    *   **Layer 3:**  Capacitive biometric sensor array.  Detects driver pulse and subtle changes in skin conductivity (GSR) through foot contact. Sample rate: 50Hz.
    *   **Layer 4:** Structural support layer - carbon fiber composite.

2.  **Haptic Feedback System:**
    *   Individual piezoelectric actuators controlled by a dedicated microcontroller.
    *   Actuation profiles dynamically adjust based on:
        *   **Vehicle speed:** Increased resistance at higher speeds to encourage gentler application.
        *   **Road conditions (via vehicle sensors):** Simulate bumps/vibrations through the pedal to warn of uneven surfaces.
        *   **Emergency braking assist:** Apply a sharp, localized haptic pulse to alert driver before automatic braking.
        *   **Driver fatigue detection (from GSR & pressure data):** Subtle rhythmic pulsations to encourage alertness.

3.  **Biometric Data Integration:**
    *   GSR data filtered and analyzed for stress/fatigue levels.
    *   Pressure distribution data used to identify driver foot position and potential inconsistencies (e.g., accidental full depression during cruise control).
    *   Data sent to vehicle's central processing unit for driver monitoring and adaptive safety system adjustment.

4.  **Control System Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Main Loop
while (vehicle_running) {

  // Read Sensor Data
  pedal_pressure = read_pressure_sensor();
  driver_gsr = read_gsr_sensor();
  vehicle_speed = get_vehicle_speed();
  road_condition = get_road_condition();

  // Calculate Haptic Feedback Profile
  haptic_profile = calculate_haptic_profile(pedal_pressure, driver_gsr, vehicle_speed, road_condition);

  // Activate Piezoelectric Actuators
  activate_actuators(haptic_profile);

  // Analyze Biometric Data
  if (driver_gsr > threshold) {
    issue_fatigue_warning();
  }

  // Check for anomalous pressure distribution
  if (pressure_anomaly_detected()) {
    issue_warning();
  }

  delay(10ms);
}
```

5.  **Power Requirements:** 12V DC, < 5W.

6.  **Communication Protocol:** CAN bus integration for data exchange with vehicle systems.

7. **Material Considerations:** Pedal surface must withstand sustained pressure, temperature fluctuations, and abrasion. Composite materials selected for durability and weight reduction. Piezoelectric actuators must maintain performance over extended lifespan.
