## Dynamic Storyboard Generation from Raw Video & AI-Driven Emotional Resonance

**System Specs:**

*   **Input:** Raw video footage (any length), associated metadata (title, genre, synopsis, keywords), optionally – user-defined emotional “target” (e.g., “build suspense,” “evoke nostalgia”).
*   **Core Modules:**
    *   **AI Scene Decomposition:** Utilizing a trained object detection and action recognition model (likely a variant of transformers with spatiotemporal attention) to automatically segment the raw video into “potential story beats” – groupings of frames with consistent action, objects, and apparent narrative purpose.  Output: Time-stamped list of frame ranges designated as potential story beats.
    *   **Emotional Analysis Engine:** A multimodal emotion recognition model (combining visual cues – facial expressions, color palettes, shot composition – with audio cues – music, sound effects, dialogue tone) to assign an “emotional score” to each story beat. Emotional scores are mapped to a pre-defined emotion space (e.g., valence-arousal model, Plutchik’s wheel of emotions).
    *   **Storyboard Template Library:**  A diverse library of pre-designed storyboard templates categorized by genre, mood, and visual style (e.g., minimalist, comic book, cinematic). Templates define panel layouts, aspect ratios, and default visual effects. Templates *also* include 'emotional guidance' parameters – ideal emotional score ranges for each panel type.
    *   **Dynamic Panel Assignment:** An optimization algorithm (potentially genetic algorithm or reinforcement learning) that assigns each story beat to a storyboard panel, maximizing adherence to both the template’s emotional guidance *and* a user-defined emotional target (if provided).  This module handles scaling/cropping to fit the panel, and preliminary keyframe selection.
    *   **AI-Driven Visual Enhancement:** Utilizes generative AI models (stable diffusion/dall-e variants) to further refine the selected keyframes *within* the storyboard panel, boosting visual impact and emotional resonance. This module can apply stylistic filters, adjust color grading, and even add subtle visual effects. Models are fine-tuned on a large dataset of storyboards and cinematic keyframes.
    *   **User Interface (UI):** A visual editor allowing users to:
        *   Adjust the assigned story beats to panels.
        *   Modify AI-generated enhancements.
        *   Manually select keyframes.
        *   Add text/dialogue.
        *   Export the storyboard in various formats (image sequence, PDF, video).

*   **Pseudocode (Dynamic Panel Assignment):**

```
function assign_panels(story_beats, storyboard_template, user_target_emotion):
    panel_list = storyboard_template.panels
    best_assignment = []
    
    // Recursive function to explore possible assignments
    function explore_assignments(current_assignment, remaining_beats):
        if not remaining_beats:
            // Calculate a score based on emotional alignment, visual coherence, and user target
            score = calculate_assignment_score(current_assignment, user_target_emotion)
            if score > best_score:
                best_score = score
                best_assignment = current_assignment[:] // copy assignment
            return
        
        beat = remaining_beats[0]
        for panel in panel_list:
            // Check if beat is a good fit for panel (based on content, emotion, etc.)
            if is_beat_suitable_for_panel(beat, panel):
                // Add beat to panel
                new_assignment = current_assignment + [(beat, panel)]
                // Recursively explore remaining beats
                explore_assignments(new_assignment, remaining_beats[1:])
                
    explore_assignments([], story_beats)
    return best_assignment
```

*   **Data Requirements:**
    *   Large dataset of raw video footage categorized by genre and emotional tone.
    *   Extensive library of storyboards and cinematic keyframes for training generative AI models.
    *   Emotional annotation data (user ratings, sentiment analysis) for refining emotion recognition models.

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Automated storyboard creation for film, animation, and video games.
    *   Rapid prototyping of visual concepts.
    *   Personalized video editing and content generation.
    *   Assistive tool for filmmakers and visual artists.
