## Adaptive Decompression Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the decompression block size *during* decompression, based on real-time data analysis within the decompressed stream. This allows for finer-grained or coarser-grained decompression tailored to the data itself, optimizing for both speed and storage efficiency.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Stream Analysis Module (DSAM):** Integrated into the decompression accelerator. Continuously monitors the decompressed data stream for patterns indicating data density or complexity.  This could include entropy calculations, frequency analysis, or signature detection (e.g., identifying image headers, database record delimiters).
2.  **Granularity Control Unit (GCU):**  Receives analysis results from the DSAM.  Contains a lookup table mapping analysis results to optimal decompression block sizes (expressed as number of bytes or records).  Can dynamically adjust the requested block size for the next decompression iteration.
3.  **DMA Modification:** The DMA engine’s descriptor format is extended to include a ‘Granularity Request’ field.  This allows the GCU to signal the DMA for a different block size without restarting the entire process. Initial descriptor sets a default block size.
4.  **Interrupt Mechanism:** GCU generates an interrupt to the DMA engine when a granularity change is requested. The DMA engine pauses the current transfer, receives the new block size, and resumes with the adjusted size.
5.  **Adaptive Learning:** The GCU incorporates a simple machine learning algorithm (e.g., reinforcement learning) to refine the mapping between data patterns and optimal block sizes over time.  This requires a feedback signal indicating the performance (speed, storage) of each granularity setting.
6.  **Descriptor Structure (Extended):**
    *   Source Address
    *   Destination Address
    *   Block Size (initial)
    *   Threshold Value
    *   Granularity Request (0 = use Block Size, 1 = dynamic)
7.  **Pseudocode (GCU Operation):**

```
function adjustGranularity(decompressedData)
    analysisResults = DSAM.analyze(decompressedData)
    optimalBlockSize = lookupTable.get(analysisResults)
    if optimalBlockSize != initialBlockSize
        generateInterrupt() // Signal DMA to adjust
        setNewBlockSize(optimalBlockSize)
        updateLookupTable(analysisResults, performanceMetrics) //Learning
    end if
end function
```

8.  **Hardware Components:**
    *   DSAM: Dedicated logic for data analysis (FPGA or ASIC)
    *   GCU: Microcontroller or FPGA for control logic and lookup table management
    *   Extended DMA Controller: Capable of handling dynamic block size requests

9.  **Use Cases:**
    *   Image/Video Compression: Adjust granularity based on texture complexity. Coarser granularity for smooth areas, finer granularity for detailed areas.
    *   Database Compression: Adapt to varying record sizes or data types.
    *   Scientific Data Compression: Optimize for data density and access patterns.
