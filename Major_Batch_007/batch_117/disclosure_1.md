## Dynamic Acoustic Mapping for Personalized Soundscapes

**Concept:** Expand the location-based response system to proactively create personalized soundscapes tailored to a user’s location *and* predicted activity, using layered ambient audio.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution microphone array (existing patent foundation).
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – accelerometer and gyroscope – integrated into the voice-input device.
    *   Optional: Low-power radar module for rudimentary gesture/activity recognition.
*   **Data Processing:**
    1.  **Location Determination:** Utilize existing sensor data analysis from the patent (audio, visual if available) to establish current location with high precision.
    2.  **Activity Prediction:** IMU data is fed into a pre-trained machine learning model (Recurrent Neural Network or similar) to predict user activity: stationary, walking, running, gesturing, etc.  Model is continuously refined via user feedback (explicit or inferred).
    3.  **Soundscape Profile Selection:** Based on location *and* predicted activity, select a relevant soundscape profile from a cloud-based library. Profiles are composed of layered ambient audio tracks (e.g., "coffee shop ambience," "forest sounds," "urban park").
    4.  **Dynamic Audio Mixing:**  A real-time audio mixer dynamically adjusts the volume and characteristics of each audio layer in the soundscape profile *based on* ambient noise levels (from microphone array) and predicted user interaction. For example:
        *   If user is predicted to be ‘focused’, quieter and more minimalist layers are emphasized.
        *   If user is predicted to be ‘socializing’, layers with human voices or lively music are boosted.
        *   Ambient noise detected from a car passing is masked with increased ambient layering.
    5. **Directional Audio:**  Implement spatial audio rendering using binaural panning or other techniques to make sounds appear to originate from specific locations within the environment. 
*   **Device Output:**
    *   Bone conduction headphones integrated into the voice-input device. This allows for immersive audio without blocking out environmental sounds.
    *   Option for smart speaker integration to project sounds into the surrounding space.
*   **Software/Cloud Component:**
    *   Cloud-based library of soundscape profiles, categorized by location type and user preferences.
    *   Machine learning model for activity prediction.
    *   User profile management system to store preferences and personalize the experience.
* **Pseudocode (Soundscape Mixing):**

```
function mixSoundscape(locationData, activityPrediction, ambientNoiseLevels):
  soundscapeProfile = getProfile(locationData)
  layers = soundscapeProfile.layers

  for layer in layers:
    # Adjust volume based on activity and noise
    volume = layer.defaultVolume
    if activityPrediction == "focused":
      volume *= 0.5 # Reduce volume for focus
    if ambientNoiseLevels > threshold:
      volume *= 1.2 # Boost volume to mask noise

    # Spatialization
    pan = getPanAngle(layer.sourceLocation) #Calculate pan based on layer's origin
    layer.play(volume, pan)
```

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond simple voice-command responses triggered by location, towards a proactive, dynamic, and personalized sonic environment designed to enhance user experience based on context and activity. Creates a truly immersive and adaptable auditory layer to the user's surroundings.
