**Dynamic PLMN Prioritization Based on Real-Time Network Performance & User Behavior**

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on *adding* PLMNs to a preferred list. This expands upon that by *dynamically re-ordering* the list based on real-time network performance metrics *and* observed user behavior. It moves beyond simple availability to prioritize networks providing the best actual user experience.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Collection Module:**
    *   Constantly monitors signal strength (RSSI, RSRP, RSRQ) for all detectable PLMNs, even those not on the preferred list.
    *   Tracks data throughput (DL/UL speeds) for the currently connected PLMN.
    *   Records latency (ping times) to several geographically diverse servers.
    *   Monitors application performance (e.g., loading times for common apps, video buffering rates).
    *   Logs user-initiated network switches (e.g., manual selection of a different network).

*   **Performance Scoring Engine:**
    *   Assigns a weighted score to each detectable PLMN based on collected data. Weights can be user-configurable or dynamically adjusted by the system.
    *   Score components: Signal Strength (30%), Data Throughput (40%), Latency (20%), User Preference (10%).
    *   The User Preference score increases when the user manually selects a specific network.

*   **Predictive Algorithm:**
    *   Employ a short-term predictive model (e.g. Kalman Filter, Exponential Smoothing) for each PLMN to estimate future performance, accounting for time-of-day, location, and historical trends.
    *   The predictive algorithm anticipates potential performance degradation based on observed patterns.

*   **Dynamic List Management:**
    *   Periodically (e.g., every 5-15 minutes) re-sorts the preferred PLMN list based on the current predictive scores.
    *   Networks with consistently low scores are moved to the bottom of the list.
    *   Networks showing improving performance are moved higher.
    *   A "safe mode" ensures a minimum viable list of networks is always present.

*   **User Profiles & Learning:**
    *   Each user device maintains a profile storing individual usage patterns and preferences.
    *   The system learns which applications are most important to the user and prioritizes networks providing optimal performance for those applications.

*   **Integration with Existing Modem Firmware:**
    *   Designed as a software layer that integrates with existing modem firmware without requiring significant hardware modifications.

  Return Score

// Predictive Algorithm
Function PredictPerformance(PLMN, HistoricalData):
  // Implement Kalman Filter or Exponential Smoothing
