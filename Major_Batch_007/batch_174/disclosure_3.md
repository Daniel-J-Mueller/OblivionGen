## Dynamic Inventory Shadowing with Projected Augmented Reality

**Concept:** Expand the weight-tracking system to not only *identify* items taken but to *project* a holographic “shadow” of the inventory’s state onto the floor around the agent, providing a real-time visualization of what *should* be present versus what is missing, and even projecting a path to the item’s correct location if misplaced.

**System Specs:**

*   **Base Surface:** Existing weight-sensitive floor tiles, expanded to cover the entirety of the materials handling facility (warehouse, stockroom, etc.). Tile resolution: 5cm x 5cm. Communication Protocol: Wireless Mesh Network (802.11ax).
*   **Agent Tracking:** Utilize a combination of ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors embedded in the floor tiles and wearable UWB tags for precise agent localization (accuracy < 10cm). The system will correlate UWB data with weight data.
*   **Augmented Reality (AR) Projection System:** An array of short-throw projectors mounted on the ceiling, calibrated to the floor tiles. Projectors must support edge blending and keystone correction to create a seamless projected image. Resolution: 1920x1080 per projector. Refresh Rate: 60Hz.
*   **Inventory Database:** A digital twin of the inventory, linked to each item’s weight and location. This database integrates with the weight sensor network.
*   **Processing Unit:** A high-performance server cluster for real-time data processing, AR rendering, and database management.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **Weight Analysis Module:** Filters noise and determines item weight changes based on floor tile data.
    *   **Agent Tracking Module:** Triangulates agent position based on UWB signals.
    *   **Inventory Mapping Module:** Maintains a digital map of the inventory, updating item locations based on weight changes and agent movements.
    *   **AR Rendering Engine:** Creates the projected AR visualization, rendering item shadows, highlighting missing items, and displaying directional cues.
    *   **User Interface (Optional):** A dashboard for facility managers to monitor inventory levels, agent activity, and system performance.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Connect to Floor Tile Network
Connect to UWB Sensor Network
Load Inventory Database
Calibrate AR Projectors

// Main Loop
While (System Running) {
    // Read Sensor Data
    floorTileData = Read Floor Tile Network
    uwbData = Read UWB Sensor Network

    // Analyze Weight Changes
    weightChanges = Analyze Weight Changes(floorTileData)

    // Track Agent Location
    agentLocation = Track Agent Location(uwbData)

    // Update Inventory Map
    Update Inventory Map(weightChanges, agentLocation)

    // Render AR Visualization
    AR Visualization = Render AR Visualization(Inventory Map, agentLocation)

    // Project AR Visualization
    Project AR Visualization(AR Visualization)
}
```

**AR Visualization Details:**

*   **Item Shadows:** Project a faint, semi-transparent “shadow” of each item onto the floor, representing its expected location.
*   **Missing Item Highlighting:** If an item is missing from its expected location, highlight the area with a red outline.
*   **Directional Cues:** Project arrows or lines guiding the agent to the correct location of a missing item.
*   **Real-time Updates:** Update the AR visualization in real-time as items are moved or retrieved.
*   **Customization:** Allow facility managers to customize the AR visualization, such as adjusting the brightness, color, and transparency of the item shadows.
