**Quantum Task Decomposition & Predictive Resource Allocation**

**Concept:** Extend the multi-resource selection beyond simply *choosing* quantum/classical. Instead, decompose tasks into sub-tasks optimizable *across* a heterogeneous network – including specialized classical hardware (GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs) *and* quantum resources – predicting resource needs *before* execution.

**Specification:**

1.  **Task Graph Generator:**
    *   Input: High-level task description (e.g., "optimize portfolio with quantum annealing").
    *   Process:  Utilize a knowledge base of quantum and classical algorithms. Decompose the task into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sub-tasks.  Each node represents a sub-task (e.g., "generate random numbers," "calculate covariance matrix," "perform quantum annealing"). Edges represent dependencies between sub-tasks.
    *   Output:  DAG representing the task decomposition.  Node metadata includes: estimated computational cost (FLOPs, qubit-seconds), data transfer requirements, algorithm options (quantum/classical variants).

2.  **Predictive Resource Allocator:**
    *   Input: DAG from the Task Graph Generator, available resource pool (quantum computers, GPUs, FPGAs, classical CPUs), historical performance data (latency, throughput, error rates for each resource type).
    *   Process:
        *   **Cost Modeling:**  Estimate the execution time and cost (energy, monetary) for each sub-task on each available resource. Account for data transfer costs between resources.
        *   **Optimization:** Formulate an optimization problem (e.g., minimizing total execution time, minimizing cost, maximizing reliability).  Use a constraint satisfaction solver or heuristic search algorithm (e.g., genetic algorithm, simulated annealing) to find the optimal resource allocation.  Consider resource contention and scheduling constraints.
        *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Implement a feedback loop to monitor execution progress. Dynamically adjust the resource allocation based on observed performance and changing resource availability.
    *   Output: A schedule specifying which resource will execute each sub-task, the start time, and the duration.

3.  **Heterogeneous Task Execution Engine:**
    *   Input: Schedule from the Predictive Resource Allocator, data.
    *   Process: Distribute sub-tasks to the assigned resources.  Handle data transfer between resources. Monitor execution progress. Collect results.
    *   Output: Final result.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Resource Allocator):**

```
function allocateResources(taskGraph, resourcePool, historicalData):
    # Initialize allocation plan
    allocationPlan = {}

    # For each node in the task graph:
    for node in taskGraph.nodes:
        # Possible resource options for this node
        resourceOptions = []

        # For each resource in the resource pool:
        for resource in resourcePool:
            # If the resource can execute this node's algorithm:
            if canExecute(resource, node.algorithm):
                # Estimate execution time based on historical data and resource capacity
                executionTime = estimateExecutionTime(resource, node, historicalData)
                # Add resource to options
                resourceOptions.append((resource, executionTime))

        # Select the resource that minimizes execution time (or cost)
        bestResource, minExecutionTime = selectBestResource(resourceOptions)

        # Add resource allocation to plan
        allocationPlan[node] = bestResource

    return allocationPlan

function canExecute(resource, algorithm):
  #Check resource compatibility based on algorithm
  # (e.g., Quantum algorithm needs quantum computer)

function estimateExecutionTime(resource, node, historicalData):
  #Use historical data to estimate execution time.

function selectBestResource(resourceOptions):
  #Choose the best resource based on cost or time
```

**Novelty:** Current systems focus on selecting *either* quantum *or* classical. This design decomposes tasks and dynamically allocates sub-tasks across a *heterogeneous* resource pool, optimizing for performance and cost *across* all resources.  The predictive modeling and dynamic adjustment further enhance efficiency and reliability.
