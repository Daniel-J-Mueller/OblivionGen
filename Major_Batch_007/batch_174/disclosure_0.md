## Data Sovereignty & Dynamic Key Sharding

**Concept:** Extend the encryption key management to allow for data sovereignty compliance and enhanced security via dynamic key sharding *across* geographic regions, tied to data access patterns. Instead of simply replicating encrypted data *with* a region-specific key, this system proactively *shards* the plaintext volume key itself, distributing portions to trusted entities in different regions, and dynamically reassembling it only during authorized operations.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Sharding Engine (KSE):**

*   **Input:** Plaintext Volume Key, Geographic Regions (with trust levels), Data Access Policies (who needs access, from where).
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a Secret Sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing) to divide the Plaintext Volume Key into 'n' shares.
    *   Assign each share to a geographically distinct 'Key Custodian' (KC). KCs are trusted entities (could be our infrastructure, partner data centers, even client-controlled HSMs).
    *   Maintain a ‘Key Map’ detailing share locations and access control policies. This map is encrypted and replicated across multiple regions for resilience.
*   **Output:** List of Key Custodians, Key Map.

**2. Data Access Workflow:**

1.  A client requests access to data in a specific region.
2.  The request is intercepted by a Regional Access Controller (RAC).
3.  RAC consults the Key Map to determine which Key Custodians hold shares necessary for decrypting the volume key.
4.  RAC initiates requests to those KCs for their shares.  Shares are transmitted via secure channels (TLS 1.3+ with mutual authentication).
5.  KCs verify the RAC’s identity and authorization. If valid, they return their share (encrypted with the RAC’s public key).
6.  RAC reassembles the Plaintext Volume Key from the received shares.
7.  RAC decrypts the volume key, then uses it to decrypt the requested data.
8.  The Plaintext Volume Key is *not* stored persistently by the RAC. It exists only in memory during the operation.

**3. Dynamic Key Rotation & Re-sharding:**

*   Periodically (or triggered by security events), the system initiates key rotation.
*   A new Plaintext Volume Key is generated.
*   The KSE re-shards the new key, potentially assigning shares to *different* KCs. This enhances resilience against compromised custodians.
*   The old key is securely destroyed.  Data encrypted with the old key is re-encrypted with the new key over time (background process).

**4.  Fault Tolerance & Availability:**

*   The Key Map is replicated across multiple regions.
*   Each Key Custodian has redundant backups of its shares.
*   A threshold scheme (e.g., 'k out of n') is used for secret sharing, allowing reconstruction even if some custodians are unavailable.

**Pseudocode (Simplified - Key Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructKey(shareList, totalShares, threshold):
  // shareList: List of shares received from Key Custodians
  // totalShares: Total number of shares created (n)
  // threshold: Minimum number of shares needed for reconstruction (k)

  if (length(shareList) < threshold):
    return Error("Insufficient shares received")

  // Lagrange Interpolation (example - adapt to specific scheme)
  plaintextVolumeKey = 0
  for i in range(length(shareList)):
    term = shareList[i]
    for j in range(length(shareList)):
      if i != j:
        term = term * (0 - j) / (i - j)  // Assuming x-coordinates 0, 1, 2...

    plaintextVolumeKey = plaintextVolumeKey + term

  return plaintextVolumeKey
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Key is never fully assembled in one location.
*   **Data Sovereignty:** Key components can be located within specific geographic boundaries to meet regulatory requirements.
*   **Increased Resilience:** System can tolerate the compromise of individual Key Custodians.
*   **Granular Access Control:** Fine-grained control over key access based on location and role.
