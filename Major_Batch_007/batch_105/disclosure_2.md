## Adaptive Resource Orchestration with Predictive Rollback

**System Overview:**

A system that dynamically adjusts application resource allocation *during* deployment, based on real-time performance metrics and predictive failure analysis, incorporating a rollback mechanism that doesn't simply revert to the previous version but intelligently blends resources from the failed deployment attempt into the restored version.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Deployment Agent (Extended):**  This agent, deployed on each host, isn't just responsible for deploying code. It's a continuous monitoring and resource regulator. It collects metrics like CPU utilization, memory usage, network latency, and application-specific performance indicators.

2.  **Predictive Failure Engine:** This engine utilizes machine learning models (trained on historical deployment data and real-time metrics) to predict potential deployment failures *before* they manifest as critical errors.  Key inputs: agent metrics, deployment velocity, and system load. It outputs a ‘risk score’ for each host.

3.  **Adaptive Resource Allocator:**  Based on the risk score, this component dynamically adjusts resource allocation *during* deployment.  If a host's risk score increases, the Allocator can:
    *   Throttle deployment velocity on that host.
    *   Shift traffic away from that host (if load balancing is in place).
    *   Temporarily increase resource limits (CPU, memory) to mitigate potential issues.
    *   Request pre-emptive scaling of dependent services.

4.  **Intelligent Rollback & Blend Module:**  In case of deployment failure, this module *doesn't* simply revert to the previous version. Instead, it analyzes the resources *successfully* deployed during the failed attempt (e.g., new database schemas, configuration files, partially migrated data). It then intelligently blends these resources into the restored version, minimizing data loss and configuration drift. This component manages resource state during rollback ensuring consistency.

**Pseudocode (Intelligent Rollback & Blend):**

```pseudocode
function perform_rollback(deployment_id, failure_reason):
  // 1. Restore previous version of application
  restore_application(deployment_id)

  // 2. Identify successfully deployed resources from failed attempt
  successful_resources = get_successful_resources(deployment_id)

  // 3. Analyze resource compatibility with restored version
  compatibility_report = analyze_resource_compatibility(successful_resources)

  // 4. Apply compatible resources to restored version
  for each resource in compatibility_report.compatible_resources:
    apply_resource(resource)

  // 5. Log any conflicts or incompatible resources
  log_incompatible_resources(compatibility_report.incompatible_resources)

  // 6. Perform post-rollback validation
  validate_rollback_success()
```

**Deployment Workflow:**

1.  New application revision uploaded.
2.  Deployment initiated.
3.  Deployment Agent deployed on target hosts.
4.  Resource allocation begins, monitored by Predictive Failure Engine.
5.  Adaptive Resource Allocator dynamically adjusts resources based on risk scores.
6.  If failure detected:
    *   Intelligent Rollback & Blend Module triggered.
    *   Failed deployment partially ‘recycled’ into restored version.
    *   Deployment marked as partially successful with blended resources.
7.  Post-rollback validation performed.

**Scalability & Considerations:**

*   System must be able to handle high-velocity deployments.
*   Predictive models require continuous training and refinement.
*   Resource blending logic must be robust and prevent conflicts.
*   Requires detailed resource tracking and versioning.
*   Monitoring of rollback success rates is crucial.
