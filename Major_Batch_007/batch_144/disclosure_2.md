## Automated Anti-Pattern Synthesis & Injection

**Concept:** Extend the modernization assessment to *intentionally* introduce controlled anti-patterns into a running application, alongside metrics capture, to create a synthetic training dataset for AI-powered code quality/modernization tools. This allows for 'ground truth' data generation where the impact of specific anti-patterns is *known*, rather than relying on analysis of legacy codebases.

**Specs:**

1.  **Anti-Pattern Library:** A curated, extensible database of anti-patterns, each defined by:
    *   **Code Transformation Rules:**  Precise rules (e.g., using Abstract Syntax Tree modifications) to inject the anti-pattern into source code.  These should support multiple languages.
    *   **Performance/Stability Metrics:**  Expected impact on key performance indicators (KPIs) â€“ latency, throughput, error rate, resource consumption.  These are predictions *before* injection.
    *   **Detection Signatures:**  Patterns/rules used to *identify* the anti-pattern post-injection (for verification).
    *   **Severity Rating:**  Quantifies the impact of the anti-pattern.

2.  **Injection Engine:**
    *   **Target Selection:** Based on application profile data (from the existing system), identify suitable code blocks for injection (e.g., methods, classes). Criteria: code complexity, call frequency, potential impact area.
    *   **Automated Transformation:**  Apply the code transformation rules to inject the anti-pattern.  This must support version control integration to revert changes.
    *   **A/B Testing Framework:** Deploy the modified application alongside the original (or a baseline version) for side-by-side comparison.
    *   **Metrics Collection:**  Gather performance/stability metrics from both versions of the application *during* live operation.

3.  **Data Synthesis Pipeline:**
    *   **Metric Normalization:** Standardize metrics across different environments.
    *   **Impact Calculation:**  Compare metrics between the injected version and the baseline to quantify the actual impact of the anti-pattern.
    *   **Dataset Generation:** Create labeled training data: `(code snippet, anti-pattern label, impact metrics)`.

4.  **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   The system leverages the existing application profile data for target selection.
    *   The anti-pattern library is stored as part of the modernization knowledge base.
    *   The modernization assessment service can *recommend* anti-pattern injection as a training exercise.

**Pseudocode (Injection Engine - simplified):**

```
function inject_anti_pattern(application_code, anti_pattern_rule, target_location):
  # Parse code into Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
  ast = parse(application_code)

  # Locate target location within AST
  target_node = find_node(ast, target_location)

  # Apply transformation rule to target node
  modified_node = apply_transformation(target_node, anti_pattern_rule)

  # Reconstruct code from modified AST
  modified_code = unparse(modified_node)

  return modified_code
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **High-Quality Training Data:** Generate accurate and reliable training data for AI-powered modernization tools.
*   **Controlled Experiments:**  Isolate and measure the impact of specific code quality issues.
*   **Proactive Modernization:** Identify and address potential problems *before* they impact production systems.
*   **Validation of Modernization Strategies:** Verify the effectiveness of different modernization approaches.
