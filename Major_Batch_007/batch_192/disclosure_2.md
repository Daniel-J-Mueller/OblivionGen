## Dynamic Sector Prioritization with Bio-Inspired Swarm Intelligence

**Concept:** Integrate bio-inspired swarm intelligence – specifically, particle swarm optimization (PSO) – to dynamically adjust sector prioritization for obstacle avoidance, going beyond static thresholding and fixed angle calculations.  This allows for more nuanced and adaptive navigation in complex indoor environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Existing LIDAR sensor integrated with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and optionally, a low-resolution wide-angle camera for environmental feature detection (color/texture).
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated onboard GPU for parallel processing of PSO algorithm and LIDAR data.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **LIDAR Data Preprocessing:** Raw LIDAR data filtered and converted into a point cloud representation. Each point is tagged with its angle and distance.
    *   **Sector Definition:**  Maintain existing sector divisions (e.g., 5-degree sectors) as a baseline.
    *   **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):**
        *   **Particles:** Each sector represented by a "particle" in the PSO algorithm.
        *   **Position:**  Particle position represents the "priority" or "weight" assigned to that sector. Higher weight = higher priority for obstacle avoidance. Initial positions randomized.
        *   **Velocity:** Particle velocity dictates how quickly the priority of a sector adjusts.
        *   **Fitness Function:** This is the core of the adaptation. The fitness function calculates a score for each sector based on:
            *   **Obstacle Density:** Number of LIDAR points within the sector.
            *   **Distance to Closest Obstacle:** Minimum distance within the sector.
            *   **IMU Data:** Vehicle velocity and acceleration.  Faster speeds = higher weight to sectors with obstacles.
            *   **Environmental Feature Data (Optional):** Assign higher weights to sectors containing identified 'interesting' features (e.g., doorways, windows) to encourage navigation toward them.
        *   **PSO Algorithm:** Standard PSO algorithm implemented with cognitive and social components to update particle positions (sector priorities) based on their own best-known position and the best-known position of the swarm.
    *   **Adaptive Braking/Path Planning:**  Braking maneuver is triggered not just by exceeding a distance threshold *within* a sector, but by the *weighted* average distance across all sectors. This enables smoother deceleration and better path planning. The direction of the braking maneuver is determined by the sector with the highest weighted priority (i.e., the most 'dangerous' sector).

*   **Communication Protocol:**  Real-time data streaming from sensors to the processing unit. Wireless communication (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth) for debugging and data logging.

**Pseudocode (Braking Maneuver):**

```
// 1. Acquire LIDAR data
lidarData = getLidarData()

// 2. Calculate sector metrics (obstacle density, min distance)
sectorMetrics = calculateSectorMetrics(lidarData)

// 3. Run PSO algorithm to update sector priorities
sectorPriorities = runPSO(sectorMetrics)

// 4. Calculate weighted average distance for all sectors
weightedDistance = calculateWeightedDistance(sectorMetrics, sectorPriorities)

// 5. If weightedDistance < threshold:
if weightedDistance < threshold:
    // 6. Identify sector with highest priority
    highestPrioritySector = findHighestPrioritySector(sectorPriorities)

    // 7. Calculate braking direction based on highest priority sector
    brakingDirection = calculateBrakingDirection(highestPrioritySector)

    // 8. Execute braking maneuver in brakingDirection
    executeBrakingManeuver(brakingDirection)
```

**Novelty:**

Traditional obstacle avoidance relies on fixed thresholds and sector weights. This system dynamically adapts to the environment, giving more weight to sectors with higher obstacle density *and* considering the vehicle's state and potentially, the semantic meaning of the environment. This results in a more robust and intelligent obstacle avoidance system.
