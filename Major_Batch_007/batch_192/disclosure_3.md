## Dynamic Resource Allocation via Inter-Adapter Communication

**Concept:** Extend the reconfigurable adapter concept beyond single-server provisioning to enable dynamic resource *sharing* across multiple servers. This moves beyond simply configuring hardware *within* a server to dynamically *allocating* configured hardware *between* servers, creating a fluid, virtualized hardware pool.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Reconfigurable Adapters (RA):** As described in the provided patent, these adapters contain programmable resources (FPGA, SoC, etc.). Each RA also incorporates a high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnect (e.g., Compute Express Link - CXL) for direct communication with other RAs.
*   **Interconnect Fabric:** A dedicated, high-speed network fabric connecting all RAs within a compute cluster. This fabric must support direct memory access (DMA) between adapters.  This network will use CXL for communication.
*   **Global Resource Manager (GRM):** A centralized software component responsible for tracking available resources across all RAs, and for brokering requests for resource allocation.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **RA Driver:** A modified driver for each RA that exposes not only the programmable resource itself but also the CXL interface and DMA capabilities.
*   **GRM API:** An API allowing client devices (or compute services) to request specific hardware configurations (e.g., “allocate a GPU core equivalent,” “provide 16GB of FPGA-based memory,” "allocate a hardware accelerated encryption module"). The GRM API will take instance requirements as input.
*   **Resource Virtualization Layer (RVL):** A software layer within the GRM responsible for mapping logical resource requests to physical resources on available RAs.  This layer will use a distributed hash table (DHT) to track resource availability and location.
*   **DMA Controller:** A software component on each RA responsible for handling DMA requests from other RAs. This will manage memory mapping and data transfer.

**3. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Request Initiation:** A client device sends an instance request to the compute service system, specifying resource requirements.
2.  **GRM Allocation:** The GRM receives the request and uses the RVL to identify available RAs that can meet the requirement.  The RVL considers not only the capacity of individual RAs but also the possibility of combining resources from multiple RAs.
3.  **Resource Configuration:** The GRM sends configuration instructions to the selected RAs, programming their programmable resources to provide the requested functionality.  This may involve loading firmware, configuring FPGA logic, or setting up DMA channels.
4.  **Resource Access:** The instance on the requesting client gains access to the configured resource through the CXL interconnect.  Data transfers occur directly between the instance and the configured resource, bypassing the server’s CPU and memory.
5.  **Dynamic Reallocation:** The GRM monitors resource utilization and dynamically reallocates resources as needed. If a resource is underutilized, it can be reallocated to another instance. If an instance requires more resources, the GRM can allocate additional resources from other RAs.
6.  **Resource 'Slicing':** Ability to subdivide a single reconfigurable resource on an adapter into multiple 'slices' that can be independently allocated to different instances. This allows for fine-grained resource sharing.

**4. Pseudocode (GRM Allocation Algorithm):**

```
function allocateResource(instanceRequest):
  resourceRequirement = instanceRequest.getResourceRequirement()
  availableAdapters = getAvailableAdapters()
  
  // First attempt: find a single adapter that can meet the requirement
  for adapter in availableAdapters:
    if adapter.canMeetRequirement(resourceRequirement):
      adapter.configureResource(resourceRequirement)
      return adapter
      
  // If no single adapter can meet the requirement, attempt to combine resources from multiple adapters
  
  combinations = generateResourceCombinations(availableAdapters, resourceRequirement)
  
  for combination in combinations:
    if combination.canMeetRequirement(resourceRequirement):
      for adapter in combination.adapters:
        adapter.configureResource(combination.allocation)
      return combination
  
  // If no combination can meet the requirement, return an error
  return Error("Resource not available")
```

**5. Potential Use Cases:**

*   **GPU-as-a-Service:** Dynamically allocate GPU cores from a pool of reconfigurable adapters to instances as needed.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Provide hardware acceleration for specific tasks (e.g., encryption, video encoding) by dynamically allocating FPGA-based resources.
*   **FPGA-as-a-Service:** Offer access to reconfigurable FPGA logic for custom hardware acceleration or prototyping.
*   **AI/ML Workloads:** Enable dynamic allocation of specialized hardware accelerators (e.g., TPUs, AI ASICs) to accelerate AI/ML workloads.
