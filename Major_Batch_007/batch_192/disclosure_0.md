## Dynamic Scene Complexity Mapping & Adaptive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the scene change detection beyond simple motion/audio analysis to create a real-time "complexity map" of the scene, dynamically adjusting processing resources *within* a scene, not just *between* scenes. This allows for nuanced resource allocation, prioritizing processing on areas of high visual or auditory information density.

**Specs:**

**1. Complexity Map Generation:**

*   **Input:** Video frames + Audio data.
*   **Visual Complexity:**
    *   **Object Density:** Utilize a pre-trained object detection model (YOLO, SSD, etc.) to identify and count objects within each frame. Higher object count = higher visual complexity.
    *   **Texture Analysis:** Implement a texture analysis algorithm (e.g., Local Binary Patterns, Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix) to measure the amount of detail and variation within image regions. More complex textures = higher visual complexity.
    *   **Edge Detection:** Apply edge detection (Canny, Sobel) and quantify the number and strength of edges. More edges = higher visual complexity.
    *   **Depth Estimation:** If a depth sensor (stereo vision, Time-of-Flight) is available, estimate depth and calculate the variance in depth values. Higher variance = higher visual complexity.
*   **Auditory Complexity:**
    *   **Spectral Density:** Analyze the audio spectrum to determine the number of distinct frequencies present. More frequencies = higher auditory complexity.
    *   **Sound Event Detection:** Utilize a sound event detection model to identify and count the number of distinct sound events (speech, music, alarms, etc.). More events = higher auditory complexity.
    *   **Harmonicity/Dissonance:** Measure the harmonicity or dissonance of the audio signal. Higher dissonance = higher auditory complexity.
*   **Map Creation:** Combine visual and auditory complexity scores into a grid-based “complexity map” for each frame. Each cell in the grid represents a region of the scene, and the cell’s value represents the combined complexity score for that region.  Normalization to a 0-1 scale.

**2. Adaptive Resource Allocation:**

*   **Processing Pipeline:** Divide the processing pipeline into distinct stages (e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, tracking, audio analysis).
*   **Resource Allocation Matrix:** Create a matrix mapping processing stages to regions of the complexity map.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   Based on the complexity score of each region, dynamically allocate processing resources to that region. High-complexity regions receive more resources (CPU/GPU time, memory allocation). Low-complexity regions receive fewer resources.
    *   Implement a feedback loop: Monitor the performance of each processing stage in each region. Adjust resource allocation based on performance metrics (e.g., processing time, accuracy).
    *   Prioritization:  User-definable prioritization. Certain objects/sounds can be flagged as 'critical' and always receive maximum processing resources, regardless of overall complexity.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Hardware:**  Multi-core CPU, GPU, potentially a dedicated AI accelerator (e.g., Google TPU, Intel Movidius).
*   **Software:**  Python with libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, librosa, and a custom resource management module.
*   **Interface:** API for controlling resource allocation parameters and accessing complexity maps.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Frame Processing Loop
for frame in video_stream:
    complexity_map = generate_complexity_map(frame, audio_data)

    # Resource Allocation
    for stage in processing_stages:
        for region in complexity_map.regions:
            resource_allocation = calculate_resource_allocation(stage, region, complexity_map.score)
            allocate_resources(stage, region, resource_allocation)

    # Process frame with allocated resources
    processed_frame = process_frame(frame)

    # Feedback & Adjustment (optional)
    feedback = get_feedback(processed_frame)
    adjust_resource_allocation(feedback)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Autonomous vehicles (prioritizing processing of pedestrians and obstacles).
*   Surveillance systems (focusing on areas with high activity).
*   Video conferencing (optimizing bandwidth usage by prioritizing faces and speakers).
*   Augmented Reality (dynamically adjusting rendering quality based on scene complexity).
