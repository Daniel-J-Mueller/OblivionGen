## Adaptive Biometric Weighting System

**Concept:** The patent describes user authentication via sensor data and models. This builds upon that concept by introducing *dynamic* weighting of biometric features based on environmental context and user behavioral patterns. Instead of fixed models, the system learns which features are *most* reliable in specific situations.

**Specs:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Sensor Array:** Existing smartphone/device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, camera, touchscreen, GPS, microphone) + Ambient Light Sensor, Barometer.
*   **Secure Enclave/Trusted Execution Environment (TEE):** Dedicated hardware for secure data processing and model storage.
*   **Low-Power Processing Unit:** Dedicated unit within the TEE for real-time feature extraction and weighting calculations.

**II. Software Modules:**

*   **Sensor Data Acquisition Module:**  Collects raw data from the multi-sensor array.
*   **Feature Extraction Module:** Extracts relevant features from raw sensor data (e.g., gait analysis from accelerometer/gyroscope, touch dynamics from touchscreen, environmental audio analysis from microphone, facial landmarks from camera, location history).
*   **Contextual Awareness Module:** Determines current environmental context:
    *   **Location:** GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, cell tower data.
    *   **Activity:**  Accelerometer/gyroscope data analyzed to determine user activity (walking, running, stationary, in vehicle, etc.).
    *   **Ambient Conditions:** Light levels (ambient light sensor), atmospheric pressure (barometer).
    *   **Time of Day:** System clock.
    *   **Network Connectivity:** Wi-Fi/cellular status.
*   **Dynamic Weighting Engine:** This is the core of the innovation.
    *   **Feature Reliability Database:** Stores historical data on feature reliability *under specific contextual conditions*.  (e.g., “Touchscreen authentication is 95% reliable indoors with good lighting, but only 60% reliable outdoors in bright sunlight”).  This database is populated and updated over time.
    *   **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**  A reinforcement learning agent constantly analyzes authentication attempts and adjusts feature weights based on success/failure.  It maximizes the accuracy of authentication.
    *   **Weight Adjustment Algorithm:** Based on the feature reliability database and reinforcement learning agent, the algorithm dynamically adjusts the weight assigned to each biometric feature.  Features deemed more reliable in the current context receive higher weights.
*   **Authentication Engine:** Combines weighted biometric features with a pre-existing user model to generate an authentication score.

**III. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Initialize Feature Reliability Database
Initialize Reinforcement Learning Agent
Load User Model

// Continuous Monitoring
While (Device is Active) {
  Collect Sensor Data
  Extract Features
  Determine Context (Location, Activity, Ambient Conditions, etc.)

  // Dynamic Weighting
  For Each Feature {
    Retrieve Reliability Score from Database based on Current Context
    Adjust Feature Weight based on Reliability Score and RL Agent Feedback
  }

  // Authentication
  AuthenticationScore = WeightedSum(ExtractedFeatures, FeatureWeights)

  If (AuthenticationScore > Threshold) {
    UserAuthenticated = True
  } Else {
    UserAuthenticated = False
  }

  // Reinforcement Learning Update
  Update RL Agent based on Authentication Success/Failure
  Update Feature Reliability Database with new data
}
```

**IV.  Extended Functionality:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:** The system can identify unusual behavior patterns (e.g., a user suddenly walking with a different gait) and flag them as potential security threats.
*   **Adaptive Security Levels:** Based on the authentication score and detected anomalies, the system can dynamically adjust security levels. For example, if the score is low, it might require additional authentication factors (PIN, fingerprint scan).
*   **Personalized Models:** The system can create personalized authentication models for each user, taking into account their unique behavioral patterns and preferences.
