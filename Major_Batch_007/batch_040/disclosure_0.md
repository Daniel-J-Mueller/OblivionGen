## Automated Shelf Reconfiguration System

**Concept:** Expand the robotic positioning system beyond simple item retrieval to a dynamic shelf reconfiguration system capable of physically altering shelf dimensions and layouts based on inventory needs and predicted demand. This goes beyond just moving items *on* shelves; it *changes* the shelves themselves.

**Specs:**

*   **Modular Shelf Components:** Shelves are constructed from interconnected, hexagonal or octagonal modules. These modules can expand or contract linearly, widening or narrowing shelf space. Module material: lightweight, high-strength polymer reinforced with carbon fiber.
*   **Micro-Actuators:** Each shelf module integrates miniature linear actuators. These actuators, controlled by the central management module, enable precise adjustment of shelf width and length.
*   **RPS Adaptation:** The existing RPS is modified with a “mapping” module. This module uses a combination of LiDAR and camera data to create a 3D map of the shelf layout *before* reconfiguration.
*   **Force Sensors:** Integrated force sensors in the RPS end effector detect resistance during shelf module movement, preventing damage or obstruction.
*   **Dynamic Load Balancing:**  The system calculates weight distribution across shelves and dynamically adjusts module positioning to optimize load bearing and stability.
*   **Predictive Algorithm:** Integrates with inventory management and demand forecasting systems. The algorithm predicts which items will be needed most frequently and adjusts shelf layouts to prioritize access to those items.
*   **Collision Avoidance:** A multi-layered collision avoidance system utilizing both software and hardware (IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors) prevents the RPS and reconfigured shelves from colliding with each other, surrounding objects, or personnel.
*   **Power & Communication:**  Shelf modules utilize wireless power transfer (inductive charging) and mesh network communication for seamless operation and reduced wiring complexity.
*   **Emergency Lock-Down:**  A central emergency lock-down mechanism freezes all shelf movement and securely fixes shelf positions in the event of a system malfunction or safety hazard.

**Pseudocode (Shelf Reconfiguration Process):**

```
FUNCTION ReconfigureShelf(shelfID, targetLayout)

  // 1. Scan Current Shelf Layout
  currentLayout = ScanShelf(shelfID)

  // 2. Calculate Module Adjustments
  adjustments = CalculateAdjustments(currentLayout, targetLayout)

  // 3. Safety Check - Obstruction Detection
  IF ObstructionDetected(shelfID) THEN
    Log("Obstruction detected. Reconfiguration aborted.")
    RETURN

  // 4. Execute Module Adjustments
  FOR EACH moduleAdjustment IN adjustments
    module = GetModule(moduleAdjustment.moduleID)
    module.Extend(moduleAdjustment.distance)  // Or retract
    VERIFY module.Position == moduleAdjustment.targetPosition

  // 5. Update Shelf Map
  UpdateShelfMap(shelfID, GetShelfLayout())

  // 6. Log Completion
  Log("Shelf " + shelfID + " reconfigured successfully.")

END FUNCTION
```

This system allows a warehouse or retail space to react *dynamically* to changing inventory needs, increasing efficiency and maximizing space utilization. It moves beyond merely *finding* items to actively *shaping* the environment to optimize access.
