## Bio-Acoustic Authentication & Predictive Disconnect

**Concept:** Utilize localized bone conduction audio as a primary authentication factor, coupled with predictive disconnect based on physiological stress indicators derived from the same audio stream. This moves beyond simple proximity and biometrics to assess *willing* authentication, preventing forced access.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Miniature bone conduction transducer/microphone array integrated into the wearable (wristband, ring, earbud).
    *   High-sensitivity, low-power analog-to-digital converter (ADC).
    *   Secure Element (SE) for cryptographic operations and credential storage.
    *   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Ultra-Wideband (UWB) for communication.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Acoustic Profile Generation:** Initial setup requires the user to perform a series of vocalizations (humming, clicking tongue, etc.) to establish a baseline acoustic ‘signature’ based on bone conduction resonance. This profile is encrypted and stored in the Secure Element.
    *   **Live Authentication:**  Authentication is triggered by a request from a target device. The wearable prompts the user (via haptic feedback) to perform a short, pre-defined vocalization. The audio is captured via bone conduction, processed locally to extract key resonant frequencies, and compared against the stored acoustic profile.  A matching profile unlocks access.
    *   **Stress Detection:**  Alongside authentication, the system continuously analyzes subtle changes in vocal resonance caused by physiological stress (increased heart rate, muscle tension). This analysis operates in parallel with authentication.
    *   **Predictive Disconnect:** If stress indicators exceed a pre-defined threshold *during* an active session (e.g., someone is being coerced to unlock a device), the system initiates a ‘predictive disconnect’. It sends a silent signal to the target device to terminate the session and revoke access *before* any sensitive data is compromised.
    *   **Adaptive Learning:**  The system continuously refines the acoustic profile and stress threshold based on user behavior and environmental factors.
*   **Data Flow:**

    1.  Target device requests authentication.
    2.  Wearable prompts user for vocalization.
    3.  Bone conduction audio captured & processed locally.
    4.  Acoustic profile compared to stored signature.
    5.  Stress indicators analyzed concurrently.
    6.  Authentication granted or denied.
    7.  If authentication granted, session established.
    8.  Continuous stress monitoring during active session.
    9.  If stress exceeds threshold, predictive disconnect initiated.
*   **Pseudocode (Predictive Disconnect):**

```
function monitorStress(audioData):
  stressLevel = analyzeAudioForStressIndicators(audioData)
  if stressLevel > stressThreshold:
    sendSilentDisconnectSignal()
    revokeAccessCredentials()
    logEvent("Predictive Disconnect - High Stress Detected")
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond static biometric authentication.  By incorporating real-time stress analysis and predictive disconnect, it addresses a crucial security gap: preventing forced access scenarios. It also leverages bone conduction as a unique and potentially more secure authentication channel than traditional microphones.
