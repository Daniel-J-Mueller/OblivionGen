## Dynamic Encryption Policy Propagation

**Concept:** Extend the intermediary’s role beyond selecting encryption algorithms based on supported lists. Introduce a dynamic policy propagation system where the intermediary *actively influences* the encryption capabilities of the source and destination over time, improving overall security and efficiency.

**Specifications:**

*   **Policy Engine:** Implement a central ‘Policy Engine’ within the intermediary. This engine defines global security and performance objectives. Objectives could include minimizing computational load, maximizing encryption strength, adhering to regulatory compliance, or prioritizing certain data types.
*   **Capability Advertisement:** Sources and destinations periodically (or upon request) advertise their *potential* encryption capabilities – not just what they currently support, but what they *could* support with a software/firmware update or configuration change. This uses a standardized capability description language.
*   **Policy Negotiation:** When establishing a connection, the intermediary initiates a negotiation. It presents a range of policies aligned with its objectives.  The source and destination *bid* on these policies, indicating the cost (e.g., CPU cycles, bandwidth) of implementing them.
*   **Just-in-Time (JIT) Capability Provisioning:** If a desirable policy requires a capability not currently active on the source or destination, the intermediary can initiate a JIT provisioning process. This could involve pushing a small software update (encrypted, of course) or triggering a configuration change.  This is an *optional* step, subject to pre-configured trust levels and security constraints.
*   **Adaptive Policy Adjustment:** The Policy Engine continuously monitors network conditions, threat intelligence feeds, and performance metrics. It dynamically adjusts policies and provisioning requests to optimize security and efficiency in real-time.
*   **Auditing and Logging:** Comprehensive auditing and logging of all policy negotiations, provisioning requests, and adaptive adjustments are required for compliance and security analysis.

**Pseudocode (Intermediary Policy Engine):**

```
function process_connection(source, destination):
  source_capabilities = source.advertise_capabilities()
  destination_capabilities = destination.advertise_capabilities()
  
  available_policies = generate_policies(source_capabilities, destination_capabilities)
  
  policy = select_optimal_policy(available_policies, network_conditions, threat_level)

  source_encryption_algorithm = policy.source_encryption
  destination_encryption_algorithm = policy.destination_encryption

  if not source.supports(source_encryption_algorithm):
    if can_provision(source, source_encryption_algorithm):
      provision(source, source_encryption_algorithm)
    else:
      # Fallback to supported algorithm
      source_encryption_algorithm = source.best_supported_algorithm()
      log("Provisioning failed, falling back to supported algorithm")

  if not destination.supports(destination_encryption_algorithm):
    if can_provision(destination, destination_encryption_algorithm):
      provision(destination, destination_encryption_algorithm)
    else:
      # Fallback to supported algorithm
      destination_encryption_algorithm = destination.best_supported_algorithm()
      log("Provisioning failed, falling back to supported algorithm")

  send_encryption_notification(source, source_encryption_algorithm)
  
  # Continue with standard encryption/decryption process
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Intermediary needs increased processing power to manage policy negotiation, provisioning, and dynamic adjustments.
*   Secure boot and attestation mechanisms are crucial to prevent malicious policy manipulation.
*   Hardware-accelerated encryption/decryption engines can offload processing from the CPU.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Policy Engine must be highly secure to prevent unauthorized policy changes.
*   Provisioning process must be authenticated and encrypted to prevent malicious code injection.
*   Comprehensive logging and auditing are essential to detect and respond to security incidents.
