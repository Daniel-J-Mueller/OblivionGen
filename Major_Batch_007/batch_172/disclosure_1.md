## Adaptive Root Granularity & Predictive Migration

**Concept:** Enhance the lifecycle-based garbage collection by dynamically adjusting root granularity based on data access patterns and proactively migrating data *before* a root becomes inactive, anticipating future use.

**Motivation:** The patent focuses on relatively static roots transitioning between active/inactive.  This introduces latency – waiting for a root to become inactive before copying data.  Furthermore, a fixed root size might be inefficient. Small, frequently accessed datasets might be bottlenecked within a large root, while large, infrequently accessed datasets waste space. This idea aims to mitigate these issues through dynamic root sizing and pre-emptive data movement.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Access Monitoring & Pattern Analysis:**

*   **Component:** *Access Pattern Analyzer* (APA)
*   **Function:** Continuously monitors data access patterns across all roots. Records read/write frequencies, access timestamps, data size accessed within each operation.
*   **Data Structure:**  *Access History Table* (AHT):  {Root ID, Data Item ID, Access Timestamp, Operation Type (Read/Write), Data Size}
*   **Algorithm:**  Implement a time-decaying average to calculate access frequency for each data item.  Identify “hot” (frequently accessed), “warm” (moderately accessed), and “cold” (infrequently accessed) data items.

**2. Dynamic Root Splitting & Merging:**

*   **Component:** *Root Manager* (RM)
*   **Function:** Dynamically splits and merges roots based on data access patterns and resource utilization.
*   **Trigger Conditions:**
    *   **Split:** A root’s access history indicates significant disparity in access frequency within the root (e.g., high variance in access counts). Threshold configurable.
    *   **Merge:** Adjacent roots exhibit low activity (both warm/cold) and resource utilization would be improved by consolidation. Threshold configurable.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Splitting:**  Identify data items within a root exceeding a "hotness" threshold. Create a new root and migrate those items.
    *   **Merging:**  Assess the combined resource utilization of two adjacent roots. If within acceptable bounds (configurable), merge them.
*   **Data Structure:** *Root Map*: {Root ID, Root Size, Access Count, State (Active/Inactive), Adjacent Root IDs}

**3. Predictive Migration Engine:**

*   **Component:** *Predictive Migrator* (PM)
*   **Function:** Proactively migrates data *before* a root becomes inactive, anticipating future access.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Prediction:** Utilize time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) on historical access patterns for each root. Predict the probability of data access within a specified timeframe *after* the root is scheduled to become inactive.
    *   **Migration:**  If the predicted access probability exceeds a threshold, proactively migrate the data to an active root *before* the original root transitions to inactive.  Data is copied, not moved.  Original remains until garbage collection.
    *   **Migration Target Selection:**  Select an active root with sufficient capacity and low contention.
*   **Data Structure:** *Migration Queue*: {Root ID, Data Item ID, Target Root ID, Migration Priority} - Priority determined by prediction accuracy and data size.

**4. Integration with Existing System:**

*   The APA, RM, and PM operate as background processes.
*   The PM intercepts the root transition event from the existing lifecycle manager.
*   Instead of waiting for inactivity, the PM initiates predictive migration *prior* to the transition.
*   The existing garbage collection mechanism remains functional for orphaned data.



**Pseudocode (Predictive Migrator):**

```
function pre_root_transition(root_id):
  access_history = get_access_history(root_id)
  predicted_access_probability = calculate_access_probability(access_history)

  if predicted_access_probability > threshold:
    target_root = select_target_root()
    migration_queue.enqueue({root_id: root_id, target_root: target_root})
    //Background process handles queue and copies data.
  end
```
