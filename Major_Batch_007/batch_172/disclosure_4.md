## Dynamic Resource Allocation via Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Expand upon the idea of assigning cores for transcoding, but proactively anticipate load *before* a channel even begins processing, utilizing a predictive model trained on historical data *and* real-time network/system metrics. This goes beyond simply matching signatures – it’s about preemptively shaping resource availability.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Predictive Load Balancer (PLB):** A software module residing between the input channel/stream and the core assignment/scheduling system.
*   **Component 2: Historical Data Store:**  A time-series database containing:
    *   Channel signatures (codec, resolution, bitrate, complexity metrics).
    *   Resource utilization data (CPU, memory, GPU, network bandwidth) *per core* during transcoding.
    *   Timestamped network ingress rates for all channels.
    *   System-wide load averages.
*   **Component 3: Real-Time Monitoring Agent:** Collects:
    *   Current network ingress rates for all live streams.
    *   System resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
    *   Queue lengths in the transcoding pipeline.
*   **Component 4: Machine Learning Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on the Historical Data Store.  The model predicts:
    *   Expected CPU usage *per core* for a new channel, based on its signature.
    *   Expected overall system load if the channel is accepted at a given time.
*   **Component 5: Core Reservation System:**  A module that can *temporarily reserve* cores, preventing them from being assigned to other tasks. This is key to proactive allocation.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Channel Ingress:** A new media stream arrives. Its signature (codec, resolution, bitrate, complexity) is extracted.
2.  **Prediction:** The signature is fed into the trained LSTM model. The model predicts the expected CPU usage *per core* and the impact on overall system load.
3.  **Availability Check:** The system checks if sufficient cores are currently available *and* if reserving those cores will keep the overall system load within acceptable limits (defined thresholds).
4.  **Proactive Reservation:** If resources are available, the Core Reservation System *proactively reserves* the predicted number of cores for the channel *before* transcoding begins.  A reservation timeout is set – if the channel doesn't start within the timeout, the cores are released.
5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**  During transcoding, a monitoring agent tracks actual resource usage. If actual usage deviates significantly from the prediction, the system can:
    *   Dynamically request additional cores (if available).
    *   Migrate parts of the transcoding process to different cores to balance the load.
    *   Adjust transcoding parameters (e.g., reduce bitrate) to lower the load.
6.  **Feedback Loop:** Actual resource usage data is fed back into the Historical Data Store to continuously improve the accuracy of the LSTM model.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Phase):**

```
function predict_resource_needs(channel_signature):
  input_data = prepare_input(channel_signature)  // Format for LSTM
  predicted_cpu_per_core = LSTM_model.predict(input_data)
  predicted_system_load = calculate_system_load(predicted_cpu_per_core)
  return predicted_cpu_per_core, predicted_system_load
```

**Innovation:**

The core innovation isn't just resource allocation – it’s *anticipating* the need for resources before the workload hits the system. This proactive approach can significantly improve system stability, reduce latency, and optimize resource utilization. By leveraging predictive modeling and temporary core reservations, the system can effectively manage dynamic workloads and prevent resource contention. This is a shift from *reactive* to *proactive* resource management.
