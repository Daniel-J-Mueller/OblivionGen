## Dynamic Privilege 'Shadowing' & Predictive Access

**Concept:** Extend the existing privilege expansion concept to not just *suggest* access, but proactively ‘shadow’ user activity with expanded, temporary privileges, learning from behavior to refine access policies *without* explicit approval requests.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Module: Behavioral Observer**

*   **Input:** User activity logs (document access, edits, annotations, searches, sharing, external link creation/access), existing access control policies, similarity measures (as per base patent).
*   **Process:**
    *   Continuously monitors user actions.
    *   Identifies patterns suggesting a need for expanded privileges (e.g., repeatedly accessing documents requiring higher-level access, attempting actions blocked by current privileges).
    *   Creates a 'shadow profile' – a temporary, elevated privilege set mirroring potential access needs, *without* granting actual access initially.
    *   Logs all actions *as if* the shadow privileges were active – capturing what *would* have happened.
*   **Output:** Shadow activity logs, pattern analysis, predicted privilege level.

**2.  Risk/Reward Engine**

*   **Input:** Shadow activity logs, existing access control policies, pre-defined risk thresholds (configurable by administrator – e.g., sensitivity of document, user role, department).
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyzes shadow activity for actions that *would* have violated existing policies.
    *   Calculates a ‘risk score’ based on the severity and frequency of potential violations.
    *   Compares risk score against pre-defined thresholds.
    *   If risk is acceptable, flags the shadow activity for ‘passive learning’ (see below).
    *   If risk is high, discards the shadow activity and logs the event for review.
*   **Output:** Risk score, passive learning flag, review log entry.

**3.  Passive Learning & Policy Refinement**

*   **Input:** Shadow activity logs flagged for passive learning, existing access control policies.
*   **Process:**
    *   Periodically (e.g., nightly), analyze accumulated shadow activity data.
    *   Identify recurring patterns suggesting genuine access needs.
    *   Generate *suggestions* for policy modifications – automatically creating draft privilege expansions or access control list adjustments.
    *   Present these suggestions to administrators for review and approval – simplifying the process by pre-populating potential changes.
*   **Output:** Draft policy modification suggestions, administrator review dashboard.

**4.  User-Specific ‘Momentary’ Privileges**

*   **Input:** Real-time user activity, predictive modeling based on historical data, risk assessment.
*   **Process:**  If the system predicts a high probability of a user needing elevated access for a specific action, grant a *temporary*, narrowly scoped privilege increase for a few minutes – without explicit approval.
*   **Output:** Temporary privilege elevation, audit log entry. This would need granular control over the duration and scope.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (UserActive) {
    ActivityLog = GetUserActivity();
    ShadowProfile = CreateShadowProfile(ActivityLog);
    RiskScore = CalculateRiskScore(ShadowProfile);

    if (RiskScore < Threshold) {
        LogShadowActivity(ShadowProfile);
        // Periodically, analyze logs for pattern-based policy suggestions
    } else {
        LogRiskEvent(RiskEvent);
    }
}

//Policy Refinement Process (Nightly)
AnalyzeShadowLogs();
GeneratePolicySuggestions();
PresentSuggestionsToAdmin();
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   High-volume activity logging infrastructure.
*   Machine learning models for risk assessment and pattern recognition.
*   Secure audit logging and data retention policies.
*   Granular privilege control mechanisms.
*   Scalable architecture to handle large user bases.
