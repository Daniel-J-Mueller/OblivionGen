**Personalized Promotional Sequencing based on Temporal Decay & Affinity Scoring**

**System Overview:**

This system expands upon the core concept of targeted promotion by introducing a temporal decay factor and an affinity scoring system. Instead of simply promoting items to users who have shown *any* prior related activity, this system creates a dynamic “promotion schedule” for each user, prioritizing promotions based on recency and the strength of their historical affinity.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Structures:**
    *   `User Profile`: Contains user ID, purchase history, bidding history, and a `Promotion Schedule`.
    *   `Item Catalog`: Contains item ID, category, price, and associated affinity weights for different user behaviors (purchase, bid, view).
    *   `Promotion Schedule`: A sorted list of `Promotion Events`.
    *   `Promotion Event`: Contains item ID, promotion timestamp (initially calculated, dynamically adjusted), promotion type (email, in-app notification, website banner), and a ‘decay resistance’ score.

2.  **Affinity Scoring:**
    *   Calculate an initial “Affinity Score” for each item for each user. This score is weighted based on:
        *   Recent Purchases (highest weight)
        *   Bids in Auctions
        *   Item Views
        *   Category Affinity (based on past purchases/bids)
    *   Formula: `Affinity Score = (PurchaseWeight * RecentPurchaseScore) + (BidWeight * BidScore) + (ViewWeight * ViewScore) + (CategoryWeight * CategoryAffinityScore)`
    *   Scores are normalized to a range of 0-1.

3.  **Promotion Schedule Generation:**
    *   For each user, identify a set of candidate items (e.g., top 20 items with highest Affinity Score).
    *   Create a `Promotion Event` for each candidate item.
    *   Calculate an initial `promotion timestamp` for each event. This timestamp is determined by:
        *   A base delay (e.g., 24 hours).
        *   A ‘recency bonus’ - Items associated with more recent user activity receive earlier timestamps.
        *   A ‘decay resistance’ score assigned to each item (higher scores prioritize longer-term promotion)
        *   Initial Decay Resistance Score: `Item.DecayResistance = (ItemPrice * 0.3) + (ItemViews * 0.2) + (CategoryPopularity * 0.5)`
    *   Sort the `Promotion Schedule` by `promotion timestamp`.

4.  **Temporal Decay & Rescheduling:**
    *   A background process continuously monitors the `Promotion Schedule` for each user.
    *   For each `Promotion Event`, calculate a ‘decay factor’ based on the time elapsed since the `promotion timestamp`.
        *   `DecayFactor = e^(-DecayRate * TimeElapsed)` (DecayRate is a configurable parameter).
    *   Adjust the `promotion timestamp` based on the `decay factor` and the item's ‘decay resistance’ score.
        *   `NewTimestamp = OldTimestamp + (DecayFactor * Item.DecayResistance)`
    *   Re-sort the `Promotion Schedule` based on the updated `promotion timestamp`.
    *   If a `Promotion Event` reaches a maximum delay (e.g., 7 days), remove it from the schedule.

5.  **Promotion Delivery:**
    *   A promotion engine polls the `Promotion Schedule` for each user, delivering promotions based on the next upcoming `Promotion Event`.

**Pseudocode (Promotion Schedule Update):**

```
FOR EACH User IN UserDatabase:
    User.PromotionSchedule = GetSortedPromotionSchedule(User) //initial schedule
    FOR EACH PromotionEvent IN User.PromotionSchedule:
        TimeElapsed = CurrentTime - PromotionEvent.Timestamp
        DecayFactor = exp(-DecayRate * TimeElapsed)
        PromotionEvent.Timestamp = PromotionEvent.Timestamp + (DecayFactor * PromotionEvent.Item.DecayResistance)
    Sort(User.PromotionSchedule) //resort based on updated timestamps
```

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond simple targeting to create a dynamic, personalized promotion schedule that adapts to user behavior over time. The temporal decay mechanism prevents "promotion fatigue" and ensures that relevant items are presented at optimal times, maximizing engagement and conversion rates. The ‘decay resistance’ score allows for both immediate and long-term promotion of items, catering to different product lifecycles and marketing objectives.
