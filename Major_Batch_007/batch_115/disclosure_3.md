## Isolated Network Service Orchestration with Dynamic Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the private network service access outlined in the patent by introducing a dynamic trust scoring system that governs service access and data flow *between* isolated virtual networks. This moves beyond simple connectivity and allows for granular control based on real-time risk assessment.

**Specs:**

**1. Trust Score Engine (TSE):**

*   **Input:**
    *   Network traffic characteristics (volume, frequency, protocols).
    *   Service reputation data (vulnerability reports, known exploits).
    *   Client identity and authorization policies.
    *   Data sensitivity labels (user-defined classifications).
    *   Real-time threat intelligence feeds.
    *   Historical interaction data (successful/failed service requests).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Weighted scoring algorithm (configurable weights for each input factor).
    *   Anomaly detection (identifies unusual traffic patterns).
    *   Risk profile generation (maps trust score to a risk level: low, medium, high).
*   **Output:**
    *   Dynamic trust score for each service request.
    *   Risk level assessment.
    *   Policy recommendations (e.g., rate limiting, data encryption, request blocking).

**2. Inter-VNet Policy Enforcement Point (IVPEP):**

*   **Location:** Strategically placed at the ingress/egress points between isolated virtual networks.
*   **Function:**
    *   Intercepts all service requests.
    *   Queries TSE for dynamic trust score and risk level.
    *   Enforces policies based on the risk level:
        *   **Low Risk:** Allows request to proceed.
        *   **Medium Risk:** Applies rate limiting, data encryption, or multi-factor authentication.
        *   **High Risk:** Blocks request and logs the event.
    *   Provides real-time monitoring and logging of all policy enforcement actions.

**3. Service Registration Extension:**

*   Modify the service registration process to include:
    *   Data sensitivity label (e.g., "confidential," "public," "restricted").
    *   Required trust score threshold for access.
    *   Associated threat intelligence tags (e.g., "high-value target," "potential data breach risk").

**4. Data Flow Tagging & Segmentation:**

*   Implement a system for tagging data packets with sensitivity labels and trust scores.
*   Use this tagging information to dynamically segment network traffic and enforce data access controls.

**Pseudocode (IVPEP):**

```
function processServiceRequest(request):
    trustScore = TSE.getTrustScore(request.source, request.destination, request.dataSensitivity)
    riskLevel = determineRiskLevel(trustScore)

    if riskLevel == "high":
        logEvent("blocked request - high risk")
        rejectRequest()
    else if riskLevel == "medium":
        applyRateLimiting(request)
        encryptData(request)
        forwardRequest()
    else:
        forwardRequest()
```

**Innovation:** This system shifts from static network configurations to a dynamic, risk-aware environment. It allows for more fine-grained control over service access and data flow, enhancing security and reducing the attack surface. The dynamic trust scoring system adapts to changing threat landscapes and provides a more resilient security posture. This differs from the patent's focus on connectivity by *actively managing* the risks associated with inter-network service access.
