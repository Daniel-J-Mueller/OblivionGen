## Dynamic Token Permissions & Temporal Access Control

**Concept:** Extend the tokenization service to incorporate dynamic, time-decaying permissions associated with each token, independent of the underlying data access. This allows for granular control over *what* a user can do with a token, and for *how long*, even if the data itself remains accessible. 

**Specifications:**

**1. Permission Schema:**

*   Introduce a permission object associated with each token. This object contains:
    *   `action`: String – Specifies the allowed action (e.g., “view”, “edit”, “share”, “download”, “analyze”).
    *   `expiry`: Timestamp – The time after which the permission is revoked.
    *   `scope`: String – Defines the scope of the permission (e.g., “full”, “limited”, “read-only”).  Can be further refined by custom data attributes.
    *   `conditional_logic`: JSON – Allows complex conditional permissions (e.g., "allow edit only if user is in 'approved_editors' group").
    *   `requestor_identifier`: String – Stores the identifier of the user who initially requested/granted the permission.
*   Permission objects are stored alongside the token data in the database.

**2. API Extensions:**

*   `POST /tokens/{token_id}/permissions`:  Creates a new permission object associated with a token. Request body includes the permission object data (action, expiry, scope, conditional_logic).
*   `GET /tokens/{token_id}/permissions`: Retrieves all permissions associated with a token.
*   `PUT /tokens/{token_id}/permissions/{permission_id}`: Updates an existing permission object.
*   `DELETE /tokens/{token_id}/permissions/{permission_id}`: Deletes a permission object.
*   `POST /tokens/{token_id}/check_permission`:  Evaluates whether a user has permission to perform a specific action on the token, given the current timestamp and user context. Returns a boolean indicating permission granted or denied.  Requires ‘action’ and ‘user_identifier’ in the request body.

**3. Authorization Workflow:**

1.  Client requests access to data using a token.
2.  The tokenization service receives the request and token.
3.  The service retrieves all permissions associated with the token.
4.  The service calls the `check_permission` API endpoint.
5.  The `check_permission` endpoint evaluates the permissions against the requested action, current timestamp, and user context. It also evaluates any `conditional_logic` defined in the permission objects.
6.  If the user is authorized, the tokenization service grants access to the underlying data.

**4.  Implementation Details:**

*   The `conditional_logic` can be implemented using a rule engine or a scripting language (e.g., Lua, Python) embedded within the tokenization service.
*   A background process periodically scans for expired permissions and revokes access accordingly.
*   The database schema should be optimized for efficient retrieval of permissions based on token ID, expiry timestamp, and user ID.
*   Caching frequently accessed permissions can further improve performance.

**Pseudocode (check_permission):**

```
function check_permission(token_id, action, user_id) {
  permissions = get_permissions_for_token(token_id)
  for each permission in permissions {
    if permission.expiry < current_timestamp {
      continue // Permission expired
    }
    if permission.action == action {
      if evaluate_conditional_logic(permission.conditional_logic, user_id) {
        return true // Permission granted
      }
    }
  }
  return false // Permission denied
}
```

This system enables much more nuanced control over data access than simple token-based authorization. It moves beyond merely *who* can access data to *what* they can do with it, and for how long, adding a dynamic layer of security and control. This unlocks features like temporary access grants, limited-functionality tokens, and time-sensitive data sharing.
