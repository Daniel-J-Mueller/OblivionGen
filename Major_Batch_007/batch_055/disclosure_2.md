## Adaptive Block Granularity & Tiering

**Concept:** Extend the pre-allocation and block pool concept to incorporate *dynamic block granularity* and *tiered storage*. The goal is to optimize both latency *and* cost by automatically adjusting block size and storage tier based on file access patterns.

**Specs:**

**1. Block Granularity Profiles:**

*   Define a set of block granularity profiles (e.g., 4KB, 8KB, 16KB, 32KB, 64KB).
*   Each file system object (file, directory, metadata) is assigned a default granularity profile at creation.
*   A 'granularity manager' monitors access patterns (read/write frequency, block size of access) for each object.
*   Based on observed patterns, the granularity manager dynamically adjusts the granularity profile. Small, random access files use smaller blocks. Large sequential access files use larger blocks.
*   Granularity changes are tracked as metadata operations (written to the journal).
*   Journal entries include the object ID, old granularity, and new granularity.
*   The system should transparently handle the block size change – existing data is either migrated (asynchronously) or accessed with appropriate offset calculations.

**2. Tiered Storage Integration:**

*   Define multiple storage tiers (e.g., NVMe SSD, SATA SSD, HDD, Object Storage). Each tier has associated cost and latency characteristics.
*   The 'tiering manager' monitors file access frequency and recency.
*   Frequently accessed, latency-sensitive files reside on faster tiers (NVMe, SSD). Infrequently accessed, less sensitive files reside on slower tiers (HDD, Object Storage).
*   Tier changes are triggered by access patterns and a configurable policy (e.g., move to slower tier after 30 days of inactivity).
*   Journal entries specify the object ID, old tier, and new tier.
*   Data migration is handled asynchronously.

**3. Block Pool Extension:**

*   The existing block pool is extended to include *tiered block pools* – separate pools for each storage tier.
*   The block pool manager allocates blocks from the appropriate tier based on the object's assigned tier.
*   When a new object is created, the system allocates a block from the default tier.

**4. Metadata Journal Enhancement:**

*   Journal entries include information about granularity and tier changes.
*   Journal replay logic handles both data and metadata migration during system recovery or failover.

**5. Pseudocode (Granularity Manager):**

```
function monitor_access(object_id, access_type, block_offset, block_size):
    access_stats = get_access_stats(object_id)
    access_stats.add_access(access_type, block_offset, block_size)

    if access_stats.should_adjust_granularity():
        new_granularity = determine_optimal_granularity(access_stats)
        if new_granularity != access_stats.current_granularity:
            write_journal_entry(object_id, "granularity_change", access_stats.current_granularity, new_granularity)
            access_stats.current_granularity = new_granularity

function determine_optimal_granularity(access_stats):
    # Logic to analyze access patterns (frequency, block size) and
    # determine the optimal granularity profile.
    # This could involve machine learning models to predict future access patterns.
    if avg_block_size < 8KB and access_frequency > 10/sec:
        return 4KB
    elif avg_block_size > 16KB and access_frequency < 1/sec:
        return 32KB
    else:
        return 16KB
```

**6. Error Handling:**

*   Implement robust error handling for data migration failures.
*   Use checksums to verify data integrity during migration.
*   Provide mechanisms for user intervention in case of persistent migration errors.
