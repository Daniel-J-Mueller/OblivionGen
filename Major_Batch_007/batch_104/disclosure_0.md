**Personalized Media "Mood Boards" with Dynamic Sentiment Weaving**

**Concept:** Extend the patent's sentiment analysis beyond simple quote selection to create dynamic, visually-driven "mood boards" for media items. These mood boards wouldn't just *show* positive/negative sentiment, they'd *weave* it into the visual presentation, changing based on user interaction and real-time data.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sentiment-Driven Visual Elements:**
    *   Develop a library of visual "atoms" – shapes, colors, animations, textures – each tied to a specific sentiment score (positive, negative, neutral, plus finer gradations).
    *   Algorithmically overlay these atoms onto a keyframe or promotional image of the media item. The density, intensity, and type of atom displayed reflect the prevailing sentiment within customer reviews.
    *   Example: A movie with largely positive reviews might have a warm color palette with flowing, light animations overlaid. A darker, more serious movie with mixed reviews might utilize cooler tones, fractured shapes, and subtle glitch effects.

2.  **Interactive Sentiment Exploration:**
    *   Implement a "Sentiment Brush" tool. Users can click or drag across the mood board to reveal specific reviews contributing to a particular sentiment. The brush highlights the relevant review snippets, displaying them alongside the visual element.
    *   Allow users to filter reviews by sentiment. For instance, they could isolate "negative" comments to understand specific criticisms.

3.  **Real-Time Sentiment Updates:**
    *   Connect the mood board to a live stream of customer review data (e.g., from social media, online retailers). The visual presentation dynamically adjusts as new reviews are posted, reflecting the evolving public opinion.
    *   Implement a "Sentiment Pulse" indicator – a visual cue (e.g., a heartbeat animation) indicating the rate of change in sentiment. A rapidly fluctuating pulse might suggest a controversial or polarizing media item.

4.  **"Vibe Check" Algorithm:**
    *   Develop an AI-powered algorithm that analyzes both review text and visual elements to generate a "Vibe Check" score. This score provides a holistic assessment of the media item’s overall feeling and appeal.
    *   The "Vibe Check" score could be displayed alongside the mood board and used for personalized recommendations.

5.  **Content Integration**
    *   Implement content highlighting by sentiment. If a movie has a lot of comments about the soundtrack, the mood board can show the album art and link to the songs.
    *   Allow users to create their own mood boards from the available comments.

**Pseudocode (Core Loop - Mood Board Update):**

```
FUNCTION updateMoodBoard(mediaID):
    reviews = getReviews(mediaID)
    sentimentScores = analyzeSentiment(reviews) // Returns a vector of sentiment scores
    visualAtoms = generateAtoms(sentimentScores) // Creates visual elements based on sentiment
    overlayAtoms(keyImage, visualAtoms) // Overlays atoms onto the key image
    updateSentimentPulse(sentimentChangeRate)
    displayMoodBoard(overlayedImage, sentimentPulse)

FUNCTION generateAtoms(sentimentScores):
    atoms = []
    FOR each score in sentimentScores:
        IF score > 0.7:
            atom = createPositiveAtom() //Warm colors, flowing animations
        ELSE IF score < -0.7:
            atom = createNegativeAtom() //Dark colors, fractured shapes
        ELSE:
            atom = createNeutralAtom() //Subtle grayscale textures
        atoms.append(atom)
    RETURN atoms
```
