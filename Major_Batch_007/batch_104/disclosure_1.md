## Adaptive Credential Scaffolding

**Concept:** Extend the temporary password/credential handling to proactively *build* more complex, multi-factor authentication methods on-the-fly, tailored to the accessing component's security profile, rather than simply providing a password.

**Specifications:**

**1. Component Profiling & Policy Engine:**

*   **Data Structure:** Each target component maintains a `SecurityProfile` object.
    *   `requiredMFA`: Enum (None, OTP, Biometric, HardwareToken).
    *   `riskScore`: Integer (0-100, calculated based on data sensitivity, access frequency, user role, etc.).
    *   `supportedMFA`: List of accepted MFA methods.
*   **Policy Engine:** A central service evaluates the `SecurityProfile` against defined organizational security policies.  The result is a `CredentialRequest` object.

**2. Dynamic Credential Generation:**

*   Upon receiving a request for access (similar to the existing "second request"), the system determines the required MFA level via the Policy Engine.
*   If MFA is required, and the user hasn’t already established the necessary factors for this component:
    *   The system initiates a “credential scaffolding” process.
    *   This process might involve:
        *   Pushing a one-time password (OTP) to the user’s registered device.
        *   Triggering a biometric prompt (fingerprint, facial recognition).
        *   Requesting a hardware token code.
*   The scaffolding process establishes a temporary MFA factor linked *specifically* to that component.

**3. Credential Bundling & Delivery:**

*   A `CredentialBundle` object is created.  This bundle contains:
    *   The base password (if applicable).
    *   The temporary MFA factor (OTP, biometric token, etc.).
    *   A timestamp indicating when the bundle expires.
*   This bundle is delivered to the target component. The component validates the bundle’s integrity and expiration.

**4. Session Management:**

*   The system maintains a mapping between the user, the target component, and the active `CredentialBundle`.
*   Subsequent requests from the component are authenticated using the established bundle until it expires.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function handleAccessRequest(user, component):
  componentProfile = getComponentProfile(component)
  credentialRequest = evaluatePolicy(user, componentProfile)

  if credentialRequest.requiresMFA:
    mfaFactor = scaffoldMFA(user, credentialRequest)
    credentialBundle = createCredentialBundle(user.password, mfaFactor, expirationTime)
  else:
    credentialBundle = createUserCredentials(user.password)
  
  return deliverCredentials(component, credentialBundle)

function scaffoldMFA(user, credentialRequest):
  if credentialRequest.mfaType == "OTP":
    sendOTPToDevice(user)
    otp = getOTPFromUser()
    return otp
  elif credentialRequest.mfaType == "Biometric":
    promptUserForBiometricVerification()
    biometricToken = getBiometricToken()
    return biometricToken
  # ... other MFA types
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus on *providing* credentials. This approach focuses on *building* temporary, component-specific authentication factors on demand, enhancing security and reducing the attack surface. It shifts the paradigm from static credentials to dynamic, ephemeral security layers. The 'scaffolding' methodology adapts security needs to component requirements in real-time.
