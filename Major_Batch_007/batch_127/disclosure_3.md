## Dynamic Item ‘Ecosystem’ Visualization

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple item comparisons to visualize a dynamic ‘ecosystem’ of related items, illustrating not just direct competition but also complementary relationships and potential ‘pathways’ through a catalog.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Relationship Mapping:**

*   **Core Data:** User viewing history, purchase history, co-viewed/co-purchased items, item metadata (categories, attributes).
*   **Relationship Types:**
    *   **Competitive:** As identified in the patent – items lowering the probability of another’s purchase.
    *   **Complementary:** Items frequently purchased *together*.
    *   **Substitute:** Items with similar attributes often viewed when a desired item is unavailable.
    *   **Ascendant/Descendant:**  Items often viewed *before/after* a specific item (sequential viewing patterns, suggesting research or accessory purchases).
*   **Weighting:**  Relationship strength determined by frequency, recency, and user segment.
*   **Graph Database:** Utilize a graph database (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) to store item relationships, enabling complex queries and visualizations.

**2. ‘Ecosystem’ Visualization Engine:**

*   **Node-Link Diagram:**  Primary visualization – items as nodes, relationships as links.
*   **Node Size/Color:** Represent item popularity (views, purchases) and average price.
*   **Link Thickness/Color:** Represent relationship strength and type (competitive = red, complementary = green, etc.).
*   **Interactive Exploration:**
    *   **Zoom/Pan:**  Navigate the ecosystem.
    *   **Node Selection:** Highlight related items and display details.
    *   **Filtering:** Filter by category, price range, relationship type.
    *   **Dynamic Layout:** Algorithm to minimize overlap and maximize readability, recalculating on zoom/filter. Force-directed layout preferred.
*   **Pathfinding:** Implement a pathfinding algorithm (A*) to suggest product ‘pathways’ based on user intent.  (e.g., User views a camera -> system suggests lenses, tripods, memory cards).
*   **User-Specific Ecosystems:** Generate personalized ecosystems based on user viewing/purchase history.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Data Pipeline:**
    *   Real-time event stream (user views, purchases).
    *   Data enrichment (item metadata).
    *   Relationship calculation and graph database updates.
*   **API Layer:** Provides access to ecosystem data for the frontend.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Web-based interactive visualization.
    *   Responsive design for mobile devices.
    *   Integration with existing catalog pages.

**4. Pseudocode (Pathfinding Example):**

```
function find_path(start_node, end_node, ecosystem_graph):
  // A* Search Algorithm
  open_set = {start_node}
  came_from = {}
  g_score = {start_node: 0}
  f_score = {start_node: heuristic(start_node, end_node)}

  while open_set is not empty:
    current = node in open_set with lowest f_score

    if current == end_node:
      return reconstruct_path(came_from, current)

    open_set.remove(current)

    for neighbor in get_neighbors(current, ecosystem_graph):
      tentative_g_score = g_score[current] + cost(current, neighbor, ecosystem_graph)

      if tentative_g_score < g_score.get(neighbor, infinity):
        came_from[neighbor] = current
        g_score[neighbor] = tentative_g_score
        f_score[neighbor] = tentative_g_score + heuristic(neighbor, end_node)

        if neighbor not in open_set:
          open_set.add(neighbor)

  return null  // No path found

function heuristic(node, end_node):
  // Estimate distance between nodes (e.g., shortest path length)
  return shortest_path_length(node, end_node)
```

**5.  Future Considerations:**

*   **Predictive Ecosystems:**  Use machine learning to predict future relationships and suggest items before the user even views them.
*   **AR/VR Integration:**  Visualize the ecosystem in augmented or virtual reality.
*   **Social Ecosystems:**  Incorporate social data (reviews, recommendations) into the visualization.
