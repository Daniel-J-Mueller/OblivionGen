## Personalized Contextual Echoes

**Concept:** Leverage the learned slot data not just for intent fulfillment, but to create a dynamic, personalized "echo" of user preferences and phrasing that subtly influences *future* interactions, even outside the scope of the original learning.

**Specification:**

1.  **Echo Database:** Extend the existing database to include not just the association between slot data and clarified meaning, but also *stylistic* features of the user's input during clarification. This includes:
    *   Commonly used synonyms.
    *   Preferred phrasing (e.g., "Turn on the lights" vs. "Lights on").
    *   Level of verbosity (short, direct commands vs. more conversational requests).
    *   Frequency of specific keywords/phrases.

2.  **Echo Profile Creation:**  As the system learns new slot data, it builds a personalized "Echo Profile" for the user. This profile is a weighted representation of the stylistic features observed during clarification dialogs.

3.  **Prompt Injection:** When generating prompts for clarification (or even for general interactions), the system *subtly* incorporates elements from the user's Echo Profile. This is *not* about mimicking the user's language perfectly, but about subtly shaping the prompt to align with their preferences.
    *   **Synonym Selection:** Prioritize synonyms favored by the user when generating prompts.
    *   **Phrasing Adaptation:**  Adjust the phrasing of prompts to match the user’s preferred style (e.g., using shorter phrases if the user typically provides short commands).
    *   **Verbosity Control:**  Adjust the level of detail in prompts based on the user’s typical verbosity.

4.  **Contextual Blending:** Blend Echo Profile elements with the default prompt generation strategy.  A "blend factor" controls the degree to which the user's preferences influence the prompt.  This allows the system to adapt to different contexts (e.g., using a higher blend factor for casual interactions and a lower blend factor for critical tasks).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generatePrompt(intent, slotData, context):
  defaultPrompt = generateDefaultPrompt(intent, slotData, context)
  userEchoProfile = getUserEchoProfile(userId)

  synonymBias = userEchoProfile.synonymBias
  phrasingBias = userEchoProfile.phrasingBias
  verbosityBias = userEchoProfile.verbosityBias
  blendFactor = calculateBlendFactor(context)

  modifiedPrompt = modifyPromptWithBias(defaultPrompt, synonymBias, phrasingBias, verbosityBias, blendFactor)

  return modifiedPrompt

function modifyPromptWithBias(prompt, synonymBias, phrasingBias, verbosityBias, blendFactor):
  modifiedPrompt = prompt

  // Apply synonym bias
  if (random() < blendFactor * synonymBias):
    modifiedPrompt = replaceWordsWithSynonyms(modifiedPrompt, userPreferredSynonyms)

  // Apply phrasing bias
  if (random() < blendFactor * phrasingBias):
    modifiedPrompt = adaptPhrasing(modifiedPrompt, userPreferredPhrasing)

  // Apply verbosity bias
  if (random() < blendFactor * verbosityBias):
    modifiedPrompt = adjustVerbosity(modifiedPrompt, userPreferredVerbosity)

  return modifiedPrompt
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased User Engagement:**  A more personalized and natural interaction experience can increase user satisfaction and engagement.
*   **Improved Accuracy:**  Subtly guiding the user’s input can reduce ambiguity and improve the accuracy of intent recognition.
*   **Enhanced User Trust:**  A system that anticipates and adapts to user preferences can build trust and loyalty.
*   **Novel Interaction Paradigm:** This goes beyond simple personalization, creating a subtle dynamic relationship where the system adapts its communication style to align with the user, fostering a more intuitive experience.
