## Adaptive Sensory Augmentation System

**Concept:** Extend the context-aware voice assistant to proactively augment user sensory experience – not just responding to requests, but anticipating needs based on logged behavior and subtly altering the environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Ambient Sensor Suite: High-resolution cameras (RGB, depth), microphones (spatial audio capture), temperature/humidity sensors, air quality sensors integrated into common household devices (lights, speakers, displays).
    *   Haptic Feedback Network: Array of micro-actuators embedded in furniture, wearables (wristbands, clothing), and potentially even surface coatings (e.g., subtle vibrations in a desk).
    *   Aroma Diffusion System: Miniature, localized aroma diffusers capable of releasing subtle scent profiles.
    *   Dedicated Processing Unit: Edge computing device (integrated into smart home hub) to handle real-time sensor data processing and effect actuation.
*   **Software:**
    *   Context Engine: Builds on existing log analysis, but adds predictive modeling. Predicts user intention *before* a voice request is made.  Uses a Bayesian network to combine log data (browsing history, application usage, sensor readings – time of day, ambient light, user posture) with external data (weather, news, calendar events).
    *   Sensory Profile Database: Stores mappings between context, predicted intention, and appropriate sensory augmentations.  This is a user-customizable database – users can define preferred sensory responses for different situations.  (Example: "If user is reviewing recipes online AND ambient light is low, increase brightness of kitchen counter lighting AND subtly diffuse vanilla aroma.")
    *   Actuation Manager: Controls the hardware.  Handles prioritization of sensory effects.  (Example: If multiple augmentations are triggered simultaneously, prioritize the most relevant or urgent effect.)
    *   Privacy Layer: Anonymizes sensor data before it is used for context analysis.  Provides users with granular control over which sensors are active and what data is being logged.
*   **Pseudocode (Context Engine – simplified):**

```
function predict_intention(log_data, sensor_data, external_data):
  // Bayesian network nodes:
  //   - UserActivity (browsing, application usage)
  //   - TimeOfDay
  //   - AmbientConditions (light, temperature)
  //   - CalendarEvents
  //   - PredictedIntention

  // Update Bayesian network nodes with current data
  update_node(UserActivity, log_data)
  update_node(TimeOfDay, current_time)
  update_node(AmbientConditions, sensor_data)
  update_node(CalendarEvents, external_data)

  // Perform Bayesian inference to calculate probability of each PredictedIntention
  probabilities = bayesian_inference(network, nodes)

  // Return the PredictedIntention with the highest probability
  return argmax(probabilities)
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  User interacts with a device (e.g., browses a cooking website).
2.  Log data is captured.
3.  Sensor data is gathered.
4.  External data is retrieved.
5.  Context Engine analyzes data and predicts user intention.
6.  Actuation Manager triggers appropriate sensory augmentations (e.g., increases kitchen lighting, diffuses vanilla aroma).
7.  User experiences subtly enhanced environment.
8.  User can provide feedback to refine system’s predictions and sensory profiles.
