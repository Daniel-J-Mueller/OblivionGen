## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning for Smart Homes

**Core Concept:** Extend the voice-controlled light switch to become a node in an adaptive acoustic zoning system, dynamically creating localized listening areas within a home. This goes beyond simple voice command execution; it aims to *understand* where sound originates and tailor responses accordingly.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Microphone Array:**  Expand beyond 2 microphones. Implement a circular array of 6-8 MEMS microphones integrated into the faceplate and/or switch housing. This enables beamforming and sound source localization with higher precision.
*   **Acoustic Emission Mapping (AEM) Sensor:** Integrate a small, low-power piezoelectric sensor array (e.g., 4x4 grid) into the faceplate. This detects vibrations on the surface of the switch/faceplate caused by sound waves *directly impacting* the device.  This complements the microphone array and is particularly useful for distinguishing direct vs. reflected sound.
*   **Edge Processing Unit:**  A low-power ARM Cortex-A series processor with a dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for real-time audio processing and machine learning inference. Minimum 4GB RAM, 32GB storage.
*   **Wireless Communication:** Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and a dedicated short-range radio (e.g., UWB) for precise indoor localization and communication with other zoning nodes.
*   **Power:** Standard AC power connection + low-power sleep mode for energy efficiency.
*   **Physical:** Maintain a form factor consistent with standard light switches.

**Software Specifications:**

1.  **Acoustic Zone Mapping:**
    *   The system continuously analyzes audio input from the microphone array and vibration data from the AEM sensor.
    *   Utilize a combination of beamforming, time difference of arrival (TDoA), and AEM data to estimate the location of sound sources.
    *   Create a dynamic map of acoustic zones within the room.  Zones are defined as areas where a dominant sound source is detected.
2.  **Voice Command Steering:**
    *   When a voice command is detected, the system determines which acoustic zone the command originated from.
    *   ‘Steer’ the voice command processing towards that zone, filtering out sounds from other zones.  This minimizes false positives and improves accuracy.
3.  **Contextual Awareness:**
    *   Integrate with other smart home devices (e.g., smart speakers, cameras, sensors).
    *   Use contextual information (e.g., time of day, user location, device status) to further refine acoustic zone identification and voice command interpretation.
4.  **Adaptive Filtering:**
    *   Implement an adaptive noise cancellation algorithm that dynamically adjusts based on the identified acoustic zones and sound sources.
    *   Prioritize sounds within the identified zone and suppress sounds from other zones.
5.  **Pseudocode - Zone Identification & Steering:**

```
// On Microphone Input
processAudioData() {
    audioData = getAudioDataFromMicrophones();
    vibrationData = getVibrationDataFromAEM();

    sourceLocation = estimateSourceLocation(audioData, vibrationData);
    zoneID = identifyZone(sourceLocation);

    //If a command is detected, filter based on zoneID
    if (commandDetected()){
       filteredCommand = applyZoneFilter(command, zoneID);
       sendFilteredCommand(filteredCommand);
    }
}

identifyZone(sourceLocation) {
    //Based on location data, assign to a pre-defined zone.
    //Zones can be customized through the app.
    //If location is ambiguous, create a new dynamic zone.
}

applyZoneFilter(command, zoneID){
    //Apply algorithms to enhance/suppress based on zone.
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Multi-Room Audio Control:** Seamlessly control audio playback in different rooms without interference.
*   **Improved Voice Assistant Accuracy:** Reduce false positives and improve voice command recognition in noisy environments.
*   **Privacy Enhancement:** Focus voice command processing on the user's location, reducing the risk of eavesdropping.
*   **Automated Sound Event Detection:** Identify specific sound events (e.g., glass breaking, baby crying) and trigger appropriate actions.
*   **Smart Home Security:** Utilize acoustic zoning to detect intruders and trigger alarms.
