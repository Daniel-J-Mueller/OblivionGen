## Adaptive Dependency Graph Prediction & Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the dependency management system to *predict* future dependency needs based on historical execution patterns, and proactively prefetch those dependencies into available execution environments. This is not simply caching, but active resource allocation based on predicted need.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Dependency Graph Construction & Storage:**
    *   During execution of any code block, a dynamic dependency graph is constructed, mapping code blocks to their dependencies (other code blocks, external services, data resources).
    *   This graph is stored in a centralized, persistent data store (e.g., graph database) accessible by the dependency prediction module.
    *   Each edge in the graph is annotated with performance metrics: execution time of the dependency, latency, resource utilization.
2.  **Historical Pattern Analysis Module:**
    *   Continuously analyze historical dependency graphs to identify common execution patterns & sequences.
    *   Utilize machine learning techniques (e.g., Markov chains, recurrent neural networks) to predict the probability of a specific dependency being required after a given code block executes.
    *   Store prediction probabilities in a dedicated prediction table.
3.  **Resource Allocation & Prefetching Module:**
    *   Monitor code execution. When a code block completes, query the prediction table for likely future dependencies.
    *   Based on prediction probabilities & available resources (idle execution environments), proactively allocate resources & initiate execution of predicted dependencies.
    *   Dependencies are executed in isolated execution environments, returning results to the requesting code block when needed.
4.  **Dynamic Resource Adjustment:**
    *   Monitor prefetching accuracy. If a predicted dependency is not required, release allocated resources.
    *   Adjust prediction probabilities based on actual execution patterns.
    *   Implement a feedback loop to refine the prediction model over time.
5.  **Execution Environment Management:**
    *   Maintain a pool of available execution environments (VMs, containers) in a ready state.
    *   Implement a scheduling algorithm to distribute dependencies across available environments, maximizing resource utilization.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// During code block execution
dependencyGraph.add(currentBlock, dependencyList);

// After code block completes
predictedDependencies = historicalPatternAnalysis.predict(currentBlock);

for each dependency in predictedDependencies:
    if availableResources() > threshold:
        prefetch(dependency); // Allocate environment, start execution
    else:
        //Queue dependency for later execution or utilize a priority system
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Dependency Graph:** Node (Code Block ID), Edge (Dependency ID, Execution Time, Latency, Resource Usage)
*   **Prediction Table:** (Code Block ID, Dependency ID, Prediction Probability)
*   **Resource Pool:** List of available Execution Environments (VM/Container ID, Status, Resource Capacity)
