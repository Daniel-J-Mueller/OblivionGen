**Adaptive Test Suite Generation via Generative AI & Real-Time Feedback**

**Core Concept:** Dynamically generate new test cases *during* test execution, guided by real-time analysis of failing tests and leveraging a Generative AI model trained on the codebase and historical test data. This expands beyond simply re-ordering existing tests to *creating* tests focused on areas exposed as weaknesses.

**Specifications:**

1.  **AI Model:** Fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) - Transformer based, trained on:
    *   Codebase: Source code of the software under test.
    *   Test History: Logs of past test executions – inputs, outputs, failures, performance metrics.
    *   Code Commit History:  Identifying recent changes and potential impact areas.
    *   Static Analysis Results: Insights from static code analysis tools (e.g., potential vulnerabilities, code complexity).

2.  **Real-time Failure Analysis Module:**
    *   Captures detailed failure information: Stack traces, error messages, input data, system state.
    *   Utilizes a root cause analysis algorithm (e.g., fault localization techniques) to pinpoint the likely source of the failure.
    *   Generates a ‘Failure Profile’ – a structured representation of the failure, including code location, input parameters, and error type.

3.  **Test Case Generation Engine:**
    *   Receives the Failure Profile from the Real-time Failure Analysis Module.
    *   Prompts the AI Model with the Failure Profile and a directive: "Generate a test case to specifically target this failure scenario, focusing on [identified area of weakness]."
    *   AI Model generates test case code (e.g., Python, Java, etc.).
    *   Generated test case is automatically compiled (if necessary) and added to the running test suite.

4.  **Dynamic Test Suite Management:**
    *   A Test Orchestrator dynamically manages the evolving test suite, adding generated tests on the fly.
    *   Test prioritization adapts based on the generated tests – giving higher priority to new tests focused on recently identified weaknesses.
    *   A feedback loop continuously monitors the performance of generated tests – rewarding successful tests and refining the prompting strategy for the AI model.

5.  **Risk Assessment Module:**
    *   Before executing generated tests, the Risk Assessment Module analyzes the potential impact of the test on the system. This could involve simulating the test execution or estimating resource usage.
    *   Tests deemed too risky are either modified or discarded.

**Pseudocode (Test Orchestrator):**

```
function RunTestSuite():
    test_suite = LoadInitialTests()
    while (tests_remaining()):
        test = GetNextTest(test_suite)
        ExecuteTest(test)
        if (test_failed()):
            failure_profile = AnalyzeFailure(test)
            generated_test = GenerateTest(failure_profile)
            if (IsTestSafe(generated_test)):
                AddTestToSuite(generated_test)
            else:
                LogWarning("Generated test deemed unsafe")
        else:
            LogSuccess(test)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `FailureProfile`:  {`code_location`: string, `input_parameters`: dictionary, `error_type`: string, `stack_trace`: string}
*   `Test`: {`test_name`: string, `test_code`: string, `priority`: integer}

**Refinements:**

*   **Genetic Algorithms:**  Employ genetic algorithms to evolve the generated test cases over multiple iterations, improving their effectiveness at uncovering vulnerabilities.
*   **Fuzzing Integration:** Integrate with fuzzing tools to automatically generate a wide range of inputs for the generated tests, increasing coverage.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:**  Train a reinforcement learning agent to optimize the prompting strategy for the AI model, maximizing the rate of successful test generation.
