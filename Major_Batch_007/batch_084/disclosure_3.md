## Adaptive Transaction Prioritization via Predictive Retry Analysis

**Specification:** Implement a system for dynamically prioritizing transaction requests based on predicted retry probabilities. This builds on the existing retry monitoring, shifting from reactive intervention to *proactive* prioritization.

**Components:**

*   **Retry Prediction Engine (RPE):**  A machine learning module integrated with the retry monitor circuits.  RPE analyzes historical retry data (type of retry, source/destination nodes, time of day, system load) to calculate a ‘Retry Risk Score’ for each incoming transaction request.
*   **Transaction Prioritization Queue (TPQ):** Replaces or augments the existing interconnect queuing mechanisms.  Transactions are slotted into the TPQ based on their Retry Risk Score. Lower scores (lower predicted retry probability) receive higher priority.
*   **Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA):**  A module that adjusts bandwidth allocation to different requester nodes based on their aggregate Retry Risk Scores. Nodes consistently generating low-risk transactions receive increased bandwidth.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  The DBA and TPQ send performance data (transaction success rates, latency) back to the RPE to refine its prediction models.

**Pseudocode (RPE - Simplified):**

```
function calculate_retry_risk_score(transaction_request):
  features = extract_features(transaction_request)  // Node IDs, transaction type, timestamp, system load
  prediction = ML_Model.predict(features) // Trained ML model (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Network)
  risk_score = 1.0 - prediction  // Scale prediction to a 0-1 risk score (1 = high risk)
  return risk_score

function update_model(historical_data):
  ML_Model.train(historical_data) // Retrain model periodically with new data
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  A requester node sends a transaction request.
2.  The retry monitor circuit captures initial transaction details.
3.  The RPE calculates a Retry Risk Score based on historical data and current system state.
4.  The transaction request is inserted into the TPQ, prioritized by its score.
5.  The DBA adjusts bandwidth allocation based on aggregate scores of requests originating from each node.
6.  The retry monitor continues to track retry events, providing feedback to the RPE for model refinement.



**Rationale:**  The existing system reacts *after* retries occur. This proposal aims to *prevent* retries by proactively prioritizing transactions likely to succeed. By incorporating machine learning, the system can adapt to changing workloads and optimize transaction flow, reducing latency and improving overall system performance.  This moves beyond simple intervention levels to a dynamic, predictive approach.
