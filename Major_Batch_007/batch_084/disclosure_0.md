## Dynamic Workflow Composition via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:**  Instead of pre-defined or API-defined workflows, leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to *compose* workflows on-the-fly, optimizing for metrics beyond just transcoding – encompassing perceived quality, cost, and even predicted user engagement.

**Specs:**

**1.  RL Agent:**
    *   **State:** A vector representing media content characteristics (resolution, bitrate, codec, duration, detected scene changes, audio characteristics, metadata), publisher characteristics (historical usage patterns, quality preferences), and current system load/cost.
    *   **Actions:** Selection from a library of granular “workflow primitives.” These primitives are *smaller* than full workflows – think individual FFmpeg filters, encoding parameters, watermarking options, or even calls to external AI services for enhancement (e.g., super-resolution).  Each primitive has associated cost and quality scores.
    *   **Reward:**  A composite reward function. This is critical. Components:
        *   **Quality Score:**  Objective metrics (PSNR, VMAF) *and* predicted subjective quality (trained AI model based on user viewing data).
        *   **Cost:**  Resource usage (CPU, GPU, storage, network bandwidth).
        *   **Engagement Prediction:**  A model predicting likelihood of full view/completion based on content characteristics and processing applied.  This is the novel part -  optimizing for *user attention*.
    *   **Learning Algorithm:**  Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

**2.  Workflow Primitive Library:**

    *   **Encoding Primitives:**  Codec selection (H.264, H.265, AV1), bitrate control (CRF, ABR), resolution scaling.
    *   **Pre/Post-Processing Primitives:**  Scene detection, noise reduction, sharpening, color correction, de-interlacing.
    *   **Watermarking/DRM Primitives:**  Digital watermarking insertion, DRM encryption.
    *   **AI Enhancement Primitives:** Super-resolution (using AI models), object removal, style transfer.
    *   **Segmentation/Advertising Primitives:**  Content segmentation for ad insertion, automated ad placement.

**3.  Training & Deployment:**

    *   **Offline Training:**  Train the RL agent using a vast dataset of media content and corresponding quality/engagement data.  Simulate different processing scenarios.
    *   **Online Learning (A/B Testing):**  Deploy the RL agent in a shadow mode, comparing its workflow choices to pre-defined workflows.  Collect real-world user engagement data and refine the reward function/RL model.
    *   **Policy Server:**  A dedicated server responsible for hosting the trained RL policy and serving workflow recommendations.

**4.  API Integration:**

    *   Expose an API endpoint for content publishers to submit media.
    *   The API receives content, passes it to the Policy Server, receives the composed workflow, and executes it.

**Pseudocode (Policy Server):**

```python
def get_workflow(content_metadata, publisher_metadata):
    state = create_state(content_metadata, publisher_metadata)
    action = rl_policy.predict(state) # Action is a sequence of primitive IDs
    workflow = build_workflow(action) # Constructs a processing graph from the primitive sequence
    return workflow

def build_workflow(primitive_sequence):
    graph = processing_graph()
    for primitive_id in primitive_sequence:
        primitive = get_primitive(primitive_id)
        graph.add_node(primitive)
        # Connect nodes in the graph (dependencies)
    return graph
```

**Novelty:** This shifts from pre-defined workflows to dynamic, *learned* workflows. It optimizes not just for technical quality and cost but for *user engagement*, unlocking potentially significant benefits in content consumption and monetization.  The AI-driven reward function is the key differentiator.
