## Dynamic Spectral Diffusion Spotlight

**Concept:** A spotlight capable of projecting not just visible light, but a dynamically shifting spectrum of light – including UV and IR – for applications beyond illumination. The intent is to create a 'light-as-a-tool' – beyond simple visibility.

**Specifications:**

*   **Light Source:** Array of micro-LEDs. Each LED individually addressable, capable of emitting wavelengths from 250nm (UV-C) to 1000nm (near-IR).  Individual LED power adjustable from 0-10W.
*   **Diffuser System:** Multi-layered, dynamically adjustable diffuser.
    *   Layer 1: Fresnel lens array for initial beam shaping. Adjustable focal length via micro-actuators.
    *   Layer 2:  Variable density holographic diffuser.  Density pattern controlled by an embedded micro-controller and addressing scheme.  Allows for precise control of beam spread and intensity profile.
    *   Layer 3:  Liquid crystal polarization filter.  Adjustable polarization angle and transmission. Allows for control of light coherence and specular reflection.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Embedded processor (ARM Cortex-M7 or equivalent).
    *   Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.
    *   User Interface: Mobile app for control & scripting.
    *   Sensor Suite:
        *   Spectrometer: Measures emitted spectrum in real-time. Feedback loop for spectral accuracy.
        *   Temperature Sensor: Monitors LED array temperature.
        *   Ambient Light Sensor: Adjusts output based on surrounding conditions.
*   **Power Supply:** 24V DC, 100W Max.  Integrated power management system for efficient operation.
*   **Housing:** Aluminum alloy.  Active cooling via integrated heat sink and low-noise fan.

**Operation Modes:**

1.  **Visible Spectrum Mode:** Standard spotlight functionality, customizable color temperature and intensity.
2.  **Spectral Sweep Mode:**  LEDs cycle through the full spectrum (250nm-1000nm) at adjustable speed and amplitude. Can be used for material analysis or as a visually striking effect.
3.  **Targeted Spectrum Mode:**  User-defined spectrum profile.  Allows for specific wavelengths to be emphasized, ideal for applications like plant growth, sterilization, or fluorescence microscopy.
4.  **Dynamic Pattern Mode:**  Combines spectral control with the holographic diffuser to project moving patterns of light.
5.  **Bio-Stimulation Mode:** Pre-programmed spectral profiles optimized for specific plant growth stages. Utilizes red and blue light wavelengths for photosynthesis.
6.  **Sterilization Mode:** Emits high-intensity UV-C light for surface disinfection. Equipped with safety interlocks to prevent accidental exposure.

**Pseudocode for Spectral Sweep Mode:**

```
// Define spectral range
minWavelength = 250 // nm
maxWavelength = 1000 // nm

// Define sweep parameters
sweepDuration = 5 // seconds
sweepType = "linear" // or "sine", "random"

// Main loop
while (true) {
    currentTime = getCurrentTime()
    elapsedTime = currentTime - startTime

    if (elapsedTime > sweepDuration) {
        startTime = currentTime
    }

    // Calculate current wavelength based on sweep type
    if (sweepType == "linear") {
        currentWavelength = minWavelength + (maxWavelength - minWavelength) * (elapsedTime / sweepDuration)
    } else if (sweepType == "sine") {
        // Calculate wavelength using sine function
    } else if (sweepType == "random") {
        // Generate random wavelength
    }

    // Set LED wavelengths
    for each LED in LEDArray {
        LED.setWavelength(currentWavelength)
        LED.setIntensity(100%) // Max intensity
    }

    delay(10ms) // Short delay for smooth animation
}
