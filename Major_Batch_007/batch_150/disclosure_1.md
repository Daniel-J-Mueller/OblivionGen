## Multi-Spectral Modulated Light Field Mapping for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend modulated light principles beyond simple depth sensing to create a dynamic, multi-spectral light field map of a scene, enabling material identification *and* dynamic object tracking with high precision.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Array:** A custom sensor array integrating modulated light sensors (as in the patent) *and* narrow-band spectral filters. Each pixel comprises a modulated light detector *and* three to five separate spectral filters (e.g., Red, Green, Blue, NIR, Thermal IR).
*   **Illumination System:** Multiple independently controlled modulated light sources emitting at different frequencies *and* wavelengths. These sources are not limited to visible light; infrared and potentially even terahertz emission are possibilities. Each source’s modulation frequency is uniquely assigned and known.
*   **Modulation Scheme:** Utilize a chaotic or pseudo-random modulation scheme for each light source. This minimizes interference and improves signal separation. Modulation frequencies range from 1 MHz to 1 GHz, depending on the wavelength.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Capture data simultaneously from all sensors. The system records both the amplitude and phase of the modulated signal for each spectral band at each pixel.
*   **Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  **Demodulation:** Demodulate the captured signals using matched filters tuned to each source’s unique frequency.
    2.  **Spectral Decomposition:** Perform spectral decomposition on the demodulated signals to determine the material composition of each pixel.
    3.  **Light Field Reconstruction:** Construct a light field representation of the scene, capturing both the intensity and direction of light at each point.
    4.  **Dynamic Scene Analysis:** Track changes in the light field over time to identify and track moving objects, estimate their velocity, and predict their future trajectory.
*   **Hardware Components:**
    *   Custom ASIC for high-speed data acquisition and processing.
    *   FPGA for real-time modulation control and signal processing.
    *   High-bandwidth memory for storing and processing large datasets.
    *   Cooling system for managing heat generated by the electronics.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   Calibration routines for aligning the sensors and light sources.
    *   Signal processing algorithms for demodulation, spectral decomposition, and light field reconstruction.
    *   Object tracking and prediction algorithms.
    *   User interface for visualizing the data and controlling the system.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Initialization
initializeSensors()
initializeLightSources()
calibrateSystem()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Capture Data
    sensorData = captureSensorData()

    // Demodulate Signals
    demodulatedData = demodulate(sensorData)

    // Spectral Decomposition
    materialComposition = spectralDecompose(demodulatedData)

    // Light Field Reconstruction
    lightField = reconstructLightField(materialComposition)

    // Object Tracking
    trackedObjects = trackObjects(lightField)

    // Visualization
    visualize(trackedObjects, lightField)

    // Control & Feedback (Optional)
    adjustLightSources(trackedObjects)
}
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple depth mapping to capture a comprehensive multi-spectral light field, enabling advanced scene understanding and dynamic object tracking with material identification. The chaotic modulation scheme and the integration of multiple spectral bands further enhance the system’s capabilities.
