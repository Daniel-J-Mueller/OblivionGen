## Adaptive Resolution Function Approximation with Wavelet Decomposition

**Concept:** Extend the hardware-based function approximation system to dynamically adjust the resolution of approximation based on input value ranges and utilize wavelet decomposition for improved accuracy and compression.

**Specification:**

**I. Hardware Modules:**

*   **Input Pre-processor:**
    *   Accepts input value.
    *   Performs initial range detection (e.g., identifies if the input falls within a 'critical' region where higher accuracy is needed).
    *   Outputs range flag and scaled input value.
*   **Wavelet Decomposition Engine:**
    *   Input: Scaled input value.
    *   Performs a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) on the input value, generating a set of wavelet coefficients.  Utilize a hardware-optimized DWT algorithm (e.g., lifting scheme).
    *   Coefficients represent different frequency components of the input value.
    *   Output: Wavelet coefficients.
*   **Coefficient Selector:**
    *   Input: Wavelet coefficients, Range Flag.
    *   Based on the Range Flag (indicating critical vs. non-critical regions), selectively retains or discards wavelet coefficients.
        *   Critical Regions: Retain a larger number of coefficients (higher resolution).
        *   Non-Critical Regions: Discard higher frequency coefficients (lower resolution, compression).
    *   Output: Selected Wavelet Coefficients.
*   **Approximation Engine:**
    *   Input: Selected Wavelet Coefficients, Pre-Stored Reconstruction Filters (associated with each coefficient), Base Values and Slopes (similar to existing patent, but adapted for wavelet coefficients).
    *   Performs an inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) using the reconstruction filters to approximate the function value.
    *   Uses base values and slopes *for each wavelet coefficient* to refine the approximation within the selected frequency band.
    *   Output: Approximated Function Value.
*   **Mapping Table:**
    *   Stores:
        *   Base Values and Slopes *for each wavelet coefficient* associated with a range of input values.
        *   Reconstruction Filters for IDWT.
        *   Coefficient Selection Thresholds (determining which coefficients to retain/discard based on Range Flag).
        *   Coefficient Significance Mapping â€“ which coefficients are most important for approximating the function.

**II. Dataflow:**

1.  Input value received by Input Pre-processor.
2.  Range Flag generated and scaled input value output.
3.  Scaled input value fed to Wavelet Decomposition Engine.
4.  Wavelet coefficients generated.
5.  Coefficient Selector receives wavelet coefficients and Range Flag.
6.  Based on Range Flag, Coefficient Selector retains or discards coefficients.
7.  Selected coefficients fed to Approximation Engine.
8.  Approximation Engine retrieves base values, slopes, and reconstruction filters from Mapping Table.
9.  Approximation Engine performs IDWT and refines the approximation.
10. Approximated function value output.

**III. Pseudocode (Approximation Engine):**

```
function approximate(selectedCoefficients, baseValues, slopes, reconstructionFilters):
    intermediateResult = 0
    for i in range(length(selectedCoefficients)):
        coefficient = selectedCoefficients[i]
        baseValue = baseValues[i]
        slope = slopes[i]
        reconstructionFilter = reconstructionFilters[i]

        intermediateResult += (baseValue + slope * coefficient) * reconstructionFilter

    return intermediateResult
```

**IV.  Innovation Points:**

*   **Adaptive Resolution:** Dynamically adjusts the approximation resolution based on input value ranges, optimizing accuracy and resource utilization.
*   **Wavelet Decomposition:** Leverages wavelet decomposition for efficient function representation and compression. Wavelets are more efficient at approximating many types of signals than polynomial approximations.
*   **Coefficient-Level Parameters:** Stores base values and slopes *for each wavelet coefficient*, allowing for fine-grained approximation control.
*   **Hardware Optimization:**  Designed for hardware implementation, utilizing optimized DWT algorithms and parallel processing.
