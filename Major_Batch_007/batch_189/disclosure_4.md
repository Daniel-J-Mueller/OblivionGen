## Temporal Data Shadowing

**Concept:** Extend the logical deletion concept to create “data shadows” – immutable snapshots of object states at specific points in time, accessible even *after* logical deletion, but segregated from active data. This allows for auditing, compliance, and advanced data forensics beyond simple versioning.

**Specs:**

**1. Shadowing Trigger:**

*   **Mechanism:** Introduce a “shadowing policy” associated with each user key or globally. Policies define shadowing frequency (e.g., hourly, daily, on-delete, on-modification) and retention duration.
*   **Activation:**  The policy automatically triggers shadow creation based on defined criteria.  A dedicated “shadowing service” handles the actual snapshotting.
*   **Metadata:** Each shadow stores: timestamp of creation, user key, original version identifier (if applicable), a unique shadow identifier, and a hash of the original object data for integrity checks.

**2. Shadow Storage:**

*   **Location:** Shadows are stored in a separate, immutable storage tier (e.g., write-once, append-only).  This is distinct from the active object storage.
*   **Compression/Encryption:**  Shadows are automatically compressed and encrypted at rest for space efficiency and security.
*   **Indexing:** A shadow index maps user keys, version identifiers (original), and shadow identifiers, enabling efficient retrieval.  This index is also immutable.

**3. Retrieval Mechanism:**

*   **API Extension:** Add a new API endpoint `/shadow/{userKey}/{shadowID}`.
*   **Authentication/Authorization:**  Access to shadows is strictly controlled through role-based access control (RBAC).  Auditing logs all shadow access.
*   **Data Reconstruction:** The API retrieves the shadow metadata, verifies its integrity using the stored hash, and reconstructs the original object data.
*   **Time-Based Queries:** Implement a query parameter `/shadow/{userKey}?before={timestamp}&after={timestamp}` to retrieve all shadows within a specified time range.

**4. Integration with Logical Deletion:**

*   **On-Delete Shadow:** When a logical deletion occurs, *always* create a shadow of the object *before* marking it as deleted.  This ensures a complete historical record.
*   **Deletion Policy Override:** Shadowing policy can override logical deletion policies for critical data.  Even if a user requests permanent deletion, a shadow is still created and retained according to the shadowing policy.
*   **Compliance Mode:**  Introduce a “compliance mode” that automatically activates maximum shadowing for all data, ensuring adherence to strict regulatory requirements.

**5. Pseudocode (Shadow Creation):**

```
function createShadow(userKey, versionID, objectData):
  timestamp = getCurrentTimestamp()
  shadowID = generateUniqueShadowID()
  hash = calculateHash(objectData)
  shadowMetadata = {
    timestamp: timestamp,
    userKey: userKey,
    versionID: versionID,
    shadowID: shadowID,
    hash: hash
  }
  write shadowMetadata to Immutable Shadow Store
  write objectData to Immutable Shadow Store (associated with shadowID)
  log("Shadow created for userKey: " + userKey + ", shadowID: " + shadowID)
```

**6. Future Considerations:**

*   **Differential Shadowing:** Store only the differences between object versions instead of full copies to reduce storage costs.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:**  Use ML to identify potentially sensitive data and automatically enable shadowing.
*   **Blockchain Integration:**  Anchor shadow metadata on a blockchain for tamper-proof audit trails.
