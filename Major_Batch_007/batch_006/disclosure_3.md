## Dynamic Content Weaving & Persona-Driven Quotation

**Concept:** Expand automatic quotation beyond simply identifying passages. Introduce a system where quotations are dynamically *re-written* to fit a user-defined persona or stylistic voice, and interwoven into the user’s writing with contextual awareness.

**Specification:**

**I. Persona Profiles:**

*   **Data Storage:** A database of “Persona Profiles.” Each profile contains:
    *   **Stylistic Parameters:**  (Lexical density, sentence length distribution, active/passive voice preference, common phrasing, tone – e.g., formal, informal, humorous, academic). These would be expressed as numerical ranges or probability distributions.
    *   **Vocabulary Sets:**  Curated lists of preferred and avoided words/phrases.  A "familiarity" score assigned to each word indicating how common it is within the persona.
    *   **Example Texts:**  A corpus of text embodying the persona's style.  Used for training a stylistic adaptation model (see II).
*   **User Interface:**  A UI element allowing users to:
    *   Select from pre-defined personas (e.g., "Shakespearean Scholar," "Tech Blogger," "Legal Counsel").
    *   Create custom personas by adjusting stylistic parameters, importing text samples, or specifying desired vocabulary characteristics.

**II. Stylistic Adaptation Engine:**

*   **Core Model:** A transformer-based language model (e.g., T5, BART) fine-tuned on persona-specific text corpora.  Input: Original passage + Persona Profile. Output: Stylistically adapted passage.
*   **Adaptation Levels:**  Adjustable “adaptation strength” parameter.
    *   *Low:* Minimal changes - primarily synonym substitution and minor grammatical adjustments.
    *   *Medium:* More significant paraphrasing and sentence restructuring, while preserving core meaning.
    *   *High:*  Complete rewriting with a strong emphasis on stylistic consistency, potentially sacrificing some nuances of the original passage.
*   **Contextual Integration:**  The engine analyzes the surrounding text in the user’s document *before* adapting the quotation. This ensures smoother transitions and avoids jarring shifts in style.

**III. Dynamic Weaving Algorithm:**

*   **Gap Detection:** The algorithm identifies natural “gaps” or transition points within the user’s writing where a quotation could be seamlessly integrated. (e.g. end of a sentence, after a conjunction, etc.)
*   **Embedding Matching:**  The algorithm calculates the semantic similarity between the adapted quotation and the surrounding text using sentence embeddings (e.g., SentenceBERT).
*   **Insertion Logic:**
    *   The algorithm attempts to insert the adapted quotation into the most suitable gap.
    *   If a direct insertion is not possible, the algorithm can modify the surrounding text to create a better fit (e.g., adding a bridging phrase, re-ordering clauses).
    *   The algorithm generates multiple insertion options, ranked by a “coherence score” (based on embedding matching and grammatical correctness).

**IV. System Architecture:**

1.  User selects/creates Persona Profile.
2.  User selects passage in source content.
3.  System retrieves source content and selected passage.
4.  Stylistic Adaptation Engine adapts passage based on Persona Profile.
5.  Dynamic Weaving Algorithm identifies insertion point in user document.
6.  Adapted passage is inserted into user document with appropriate citation.
7.  User can review and adjust the insertion if necessary.



**Pseudocode (Dynamic Weaving Algorithm):**

```
function weave_quotation(user_document, adapted_quotation):
  gaps = find_gaps(user_document)
  scored_options = []
  for gap in gaps:
    coherence_score = calculate_coherence(gap, adapted_quotation)
    scored_options.append((gap, coherence_score))
  sorted_options = sort_by_score(scored_options, descending=True)
  best_gap = sorted_options[0][0]
  insert_quotation(best_gap, adapted_quotation)
  return
```
