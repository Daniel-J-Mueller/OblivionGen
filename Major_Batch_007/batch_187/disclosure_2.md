## Dynamic Resource ‘Sharding’ with Predictive Preemption

**Concept:** Extend the lottery-based allocation by introducing a dynamic ‘sharding’ of compute resources *within* slots, coupled with predictive preemption based on job behavior. Instead of allocating entire slots, the system divides each slot into smaller, dynamically sized ‘shares’. This allows for finer-grained allocation and enables a form of ‘over-subscription’ within guaranteed capacity.

**Motivation:** The patent focuses on allocating *slots*. This is a coarse granularity. Modern workloads aren’t uniformly demanding. Allocating an entire slot to a job that only needs 20% of it is wasteful. This design aims to maximize utilization *within* guaranteed capacity, and intelligently handle contention.

**Specs:**

**1. Share Definition & Management:**

*   Each slot is divisible into ‘shares’.  The initial share size is configurable (e.g., 1/16, 1/32 of a slot – adjustable per client/workload type).
*   A ‘Share Manager’ component monitors resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O) of jobs running on shares.
*   Shares are dynamically resized based on job demand.  If a job consistently utilizes >80% of its allocated share, the Share Manager attempts to grow it (up to the full slot size) by borrowing unused capacity from neighboring shares.
*   If a share cannot grow due to lack of available capacity, a ‘Contention Resolver’ is triggered.

**2. Contention Resolution & Predictive Preemption:**

*   The Contention Resolver analyzes the jobs competing for resources.  It utilizes a predictive model (trained on historical job behavior) to estimate the *remaining* resource demand of each job.
*   The model considers factors like:
    *   Job type (e.g., batch, interactive, real-time).
    *   Progress (e.g., percentage complete).
    *   Resource usage patterns (e.g., CPU spikes, memory leaks).
*   Based on the prediction, the Contention Resolver identifies the job with the *lowest* predicted remaining resource demand *and* the *highest* preemption tolerance (configurable per job/client).
*   That job is *predictively preempted* (gracefully paused) and its share allocated to the requesting job.
*   The preempted job is placed in a ‘preemption queue’ and resumed when sufficient capacity becomes available.  Priority in the preemption queue is also configurable.

**3. Lottery Integration:**

*   The existing lottery algorithm is *extended* to consider share-level allocation.
*   Clients are assigned lottery tickets based on their guaranteed capacity (total number of slots *and* shares).
*   When a job request arrives, the lottery selects a client.
*   The system then determines if an available *share* exists within that client’s capacity.
*   If no share is available, it considers the possibility of preempting a lower-priority job on a share (based on the predictive model).
*   If preemption is necessary, the lottery weight influences the preemption decision (higher lottery weight = lower chance of preemption).

**4. System Components:**

*   **Share Manager:** Monitors resource usage, resizes shares.
*   **Contention Resolver:**  Predictive preemption based on job behavior.
*   **Prediction Model:** Trained on historical job data.
*   **Preemption Queue:**  Manages preempted jobs.
*   **Lottery Engine:**  Ticket assignment, client selection.
*   **Resource Scheduler:**  Allocates shares to jobs.

**Pseudocode (Contention Resolution):**

```
function resolveContention(requestingJob, competingJobs):
  predictedDemands = {}
  for job in competingJobs:
    predictedDemands[job] = predictRemainingDemand(job)

  lowestDemandJob = null
  lowestDemand = infinity

  for job, demand in predictedDemands.items():
    if demand < lowestDemand and isPreemptible(job):
      lowestDemand = demand
      lowestDemandJob = job

  if lowestDemandJob != null:
    preemptJob(lowestDemandJob)
    allocateShare(requestingJob, lowestDemandJob.share)
  else:
    // No preemptible job found – reject request or queue it
    queueRequest(requestingJob)
```

**Novelty:**  This system goes beyond slot-level allocation by introducing fine-grained share management and predictive preemption. This maximizes resource utilization *within* guaranteed capacity and allows for a more dynamic and responsive allocation system. The predictive model adds an intelligent layer to preemption, minimizing disruption and ensuring that the most appropriate jobs are prioritized.
