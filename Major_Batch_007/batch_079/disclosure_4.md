## Adaptive Content Prefetching via Predictive User Journey Mapping

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Dynamically predict a user’s likely navigation path *within* a website (or across a linked set of sites) and proactively prefetch content for those anticipated pages, going beyond simply caching frequently accessed resources.  This builds on the patent's cluster-based interest targeting, but focuses on *sequential* content consumption prediction.

**II. Data Inputs:**

*   **User Cluster ID:** From the existing patent’s system, identifying a user’s interest group.
*   **Real-time Navigation Data:** Timestamped record of pages visited *within the current session*.
*   **Historical Journey Data:** Aggregated, anonymized navigation paths of users *within the same cluster*.  This forms a probabilistic model of typical journeys.
*   **Content Metadata:**  Tags, keywords, categories, and relationships between pages.  (Leverages existing tag system.)
*   **Time-to-Load Estimates:** Predictions of how long each content element will take to load, factoring in network conditions (estimated via CDN edge server data) and content size.

**III. Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
FUNCTION PredictNextPage(userClusterID, currentNavigationHistory, contentMetadata):

    // 1. Retrieve Top N Most Likely Journeys from Historical Data for userClusterID
    topJourneys = GetTopJourneys(userClusterID, currentNavigationHistory, N=5)

    // 2. Calculate Probability Score for each potential next page
    pageProbabilities = {}
    FOR each potentialNextPage IN allPages:
        probability = 0
        FOR each journey IN topJourneys:
            IF potentialNextPage is next page in journey:
                probability += journey.probabilityWeight //Journey probability influences weight.
        pageProbabilities[potentialNextPage] = probability

    // 3. Factor in Content Load Time
    FOR each page, probability IN pageProbabilities:
        loadTimeEstimate = EstimateContentLoadTime(page)
        probability = probability / (1 + loadTimeEstimate) // Prioritize faster loading pages.

    // 4. Return Top 3 Most Likely Pages (and probabilities)
    RETURN Top3(pageProbabilities)
```

**IV. Prefetching Mechanism:**

*   The CDN edge server monitors user navigation.
*   Upon a page load, call `PredictNextPage()` to identify likely next pages.
*   Initiate asynchronous requests to prefetch content for those pages *before* the user navigates to them.
*   Store prefetched content in the edge server cache.
*   When the user *does* navigate to a prefetched page, serve it immediately from the cache, resulting in near-instant load times.

**V.  Dynamic Adjustment & Decay:**

*   User actions (e.g., navigating to an unexpected page, abandoning a journey) should trigger a recalculation of the predictive model.
*   Historical journey data should be periodically updated to reflect changing user behavior and content trends.
*   Employ decay factors on historical data to prioritize recent behavior.

**VI.  Implementation Details:**

*   Requires integration with existing CDN infrastructure and caching mechanisms.
*   Scalability is critical; the predictive model and prefetching mechanism must handle a high volume of requests.
*   Monitoring and analytics are essential to track performance, identify bottlenecks, and refine the algorithm.
