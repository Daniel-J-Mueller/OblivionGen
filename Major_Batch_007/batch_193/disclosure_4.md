## Temporal Data ‘Shadowing’ for Predictive Tiering

**Concept:** Expand tiered storage capabilities by dynamically ‘shadowing’ time-series data across tiers *before* a query is even received, using predictive algorithms based on historical access patterns and data characteristics. This anticipates query needs and moves frequently accessed data ‘closer’ to faster tiers.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Shadowing Agent:** A component residing within the distributed time-series database responsible for monitoring data access patterns (query logs, read frequencies) and data characteristics (volatility, size, growth rate).
*   **Predictive Model:** A machine learning model trained on historical access data and data characteristics. This model predicts the likelihood of future access for each data segment (defined by spatial and temporal boundaries).  Algorithms could include time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) combined with data characteristic analysis.
*   **Tier Assignment Policy:** A policy engine that uses the predictive model output to determine the optimal tier for each data segment. This policy considers:
    *   **Access Probability:** Higher probability = faster tier.
    *   **Data Volatility:**  Highly volatile data (frequent updates) may benefit from caching in faster tiers.
    *   **Data Size:** Larger data segments may be partially shadowed (e.g., frequent access windows shadowed, infrequent access periods remain in colder storage).
    *   **Tier Costs:**  Factor in the cost of each tier to optimize cost vs. performance.
*   **Asynchronous Data Movement:** Data shadowing occurs asynchronously in the background, minimizing impact on query performance.  Use techniques like copy-on-write or incremental data transfer.
*   **Metadata Enhancement:** The metadata index must be expanded to track the ‘shadowed’ locations of data segments across all tiers.  This allows the query engine to transparently access data from the closest available tier.
*   **Adaptive Granularity:** Shadowing granularity (data segment size) is adaptive.  Frequently accessed data is shadowed at a finer granularity than infrequently accessed data.
*   **Dynamic Re-Tiering:**  The predictive model continuously re-evaluates access probabilities and dynamically re-tiers data segments as access patterns change.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Within the Data Shadowing Agent
function analyzeAccessPatterns() {
  // Collect query logs and data characteristics
  logData = getQueryLogs()
  dataCharacteristics = getDataCharacteristics()

  // Train predictive model
  model = trainModel(logData, dataCharacteristics)

  return model
}

function determineTierAssignment(dataSegment, model) {
  // Predict access probability
  accessProbability = model.predict(dataSegment)

  // Apply tier assignment policy
  tier = applyTierPolicy(accessProbability, dataSegment.size, dataSegment.volatility)

  return tier
}

function shadowData(dataSegment, targetTier) {
  // Asynchronously copy or move data to target tier
  copyData(dataSegment, targetTier)
  // Update metadata index with new location
  updateMetadataIndex(dataSegment, targetTier)
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  model = analyzeAccessPatterns()
  for each dataSegment in database {
    targetTier = determineTierAssignment(dataSegment, model)
    if (targetTier != currentTier(dataSegment)) {
      shadowData(dataSegment, targetTier)
    }
  }
  sleep(interval) // Run periodically
}
```

**Innovation:**

Unlike existing tiered storage systems which react to queries, this proactively prepares data based on *predicted* needs. It transforms the system from being query-driven to being *predictively* tiered, potentially reducing query latency and improving overall performance. The dynamic re-tiering ensures the system adapts to changing access patterns over time.
