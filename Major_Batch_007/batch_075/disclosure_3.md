## Dynamic Password "Health" & Predictive Lockout

**Concept:** Instead of solely focusing on incorrect attempts *after* a password change, proactively assess password "health" based on behavioral biometrics and predicted vulnerability, adjusting lockout thresholds *before* any incorrect attempts occur. This moves from reactive security to predictive security.

**Specs:**

**1. Behavioral Biometric Data Collection:**

*   **Keystroke Dynamics:** Monitor typing speed, rhythm, pressure (if available via device), and error rate during password entry.  Store a baseline for each user after initial password setup/change.
*   **Mouse/Touch Movement:** (If applicable to login method) Track speed, pressure, and patterns of movement during login sequence.
*   **Time of Day/Location:** Record login times and approximate locations (based on IP address or device GPS - with user consent).
*   **Device Fingerprinting:** Identify the device used for login (browser/OS/hardware). Track changes in devices.

**2. Password "Health" Score Calculation:**

*   **Score Components:**  Assign weights to each data point collected (keystroke variance, location anomalies, device changes, time of day deviations).  Weights adjustable via admin panel.
*   **Baseline Drift Detection:** Continuously compare current biometric data to the user's established baseline.  Significant deviations lower the "health" score.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement algorithms to identify unusual patterns. (e.g., login from a new country, drastically different typing speed).
*   **Score Range:** 0-100.  100 = Optimal Health.  Below 50 indicates high risk.

**3. Dynamic Lockout Threshold Adjustment:**

*   **Threshold Mapping:** Create a mapping between the "Health" score and the incorrect attempt threshold.
    *   Score 80-100:  Standard threshold (e.g., 5 incorrect attempts)
    *   Score 60-79:  Reduced threshold (e.g., 3 incorrect attempts)
    *   Score 40-59:  Very Low Threshold (e.g., 2 incorrect attempts, or immediate 2FA challenge)
    *   Score 0-39: Account Locked.  Require admin intervention or strong identity verification.
*   **Predictive Lockout:**  If the "Health" score falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 40), proactively lock the account (or require 2FA) *before* any incorrect attempts are made.

**4.  "Grace Period" for Anomalies:**

*   **Short-Term Deviation Tolerance:** Allow for minor deviations from the baseline (e.g., slightly faster typing speed due to stress) without immediately lowering the "Health" score. Implement a smoothing function.
*   **Confirmation Challenge:**  If a single anomalous event occurs, present a challenge question or a subtle image recognition task to confirm user identity.

**5.  Admin Interface:**

*   **Health Score Monitoring:** Display real-time "Health" scores for all users.
*   **Threshold Configuration:**  Allow administrators to customize the threshold mapping and anomaly detection settings.
*   **Alerting:**  Generate alerts when a user's "Health" score falls below a critical level.
*   **Manual Override:** Allow administrators to manually adjust a userâ€™s account status.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculateHealthScore(user, currentData) {
    baseline = getUserBaseline(user);
    deviationScore = calculateDeviation(currentData, baseline);
    anomalyScore = detectAnomalies(currentData);
    healthScore = (100 - deviationScore - anomalyScore); // Scale and combine scores
    return healthScore;
}

function determineLockoutThreshold(healthScore) {
    if (healthScore >= 80) {
        return 5; // Standard threshold
    } else if (healthScore >= 60) {
        return 3; // Reduced threshold
    } else if (healthScore >= 40) {
        return 2; // Very low threshold
    } else {
        return 0; // Account locked
    }
}

onLoginAttempt(user, password) {
    healthScore = calculateHealthScore(user, getLoginData());
    lockoutThreshold = determineLockoutThreshold(healthScore);

    if (password incorrect and incorrectAttempts < lockoutThreshold) {
        incorrectAttempts++;
        return false; // Authentication failed
    } else if (password incorrect and incorrectAttempts >= lockoutThreshold) {
        lockAccount(user);
        return false;
    } else {
        // Authentication success
        resetIncorrectAttempts(user);
        return true;
    }
}
```
