## Dynamic Provenance Mapping for Digital Works

**Concept:** Extend the public domain analysis system to incorporate a dynamic provenance mapping layer. Instead of *just* determining public domain status, track the entire lifecycle of a digital work – its creation, modifications, distributions, and associated rights – creating a continuously updated 'digital genealogy'. This enables not just legal determination, but granular rights management and attribution.

**System Specs:**

*   **Provenance Database:** A graph database storing information about digital works. Nodes represent works, creators, owners, publishers, modifications, and distributions. Edges represent relationships (e.g., "created_by", "owned_by", "modified_from", "distributed_via").
*   **Automated Data Ingestion:**
    *   Web Crawlers: Monitor online repositories (Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive, etc.) for new and updated works, extracting metadata.
    *   Blockchain Integration:  Optionally integrate with blockchain-based digital rights management systems to verify ownership and modification history.
    *   API Integration:  Connect to existing metadata providers (e.g., library catalogs, music databases).
*   **AI-Powered Relationship Extraction:**
    *   Natural Language Processing (NLP):  Analyze textual data (e.g., acknowledgements, copyright notices, licensing agreements) to identify relationships between works and creators.
    *   Image/Audio Analysis:  Identify visual or auditory similarities between works to suggest potential derivative relationships.
*   **Confidence Scoring:** Assign confidence scores to each relationship based on the strength of the evidence (e.g., verified blockchain record vs. NLP-derived inference).
*   **Dynamic Confidence Level Calculation:** Expand the existing numerical confidence level to consider provenance data. Public domain status isn't just about the last creator's death date, but the *completeness and veracity* of the provenance chain.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Interactive Graph Visualization: Display the provenance graph for a selected work, allowing users to explore its history.
    *   Confidence Score Overlay:  Highlight relationships with low confidence scores, indicating areas where further research is needed.
    *   Rights Management Tools:  Enable users to define access controls and licensing terms based on the provenance data.
*   **Workflow Engine:**
    *   Automated Dispute Resolution:  Use the provenance data to resolve copyright disputes and identify potential infringement.
    *   Rights Clearance Automation:  Automate the process of obtaining permissions and licenses for derivative works.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```pseudocode
function analyzeWork(workURL):
  workData = ingestData(workURL)
  metadata = extractMetadata(workData)
  provenanceGraph = buildProvenanceGraph(metadata)
  confidenceLevel = calculateConfidenceLevel(provenanceGraph)

  if confidenceLevel > threshold:
    recommendation = "Make work available as public domain document"
  else:
    recommendation = "Perform further research on provenance"

  displayUI(confidenceLevel, recommendation, provenanceGraph)
end function

function buildProvenanceGraph(metadata):
  graph = new Graph()
  # Add nodes for work, creator, owner, publisher, etc.
  # Extract relationships from metadata and connect nodes
  # Use AI to infer relationships where data is missing
  return graph
end function

function calculateConfidenceLevel(graph):
  # Assign weights to relationships based on evidence strength
  # Calculate a global confidence score based on weighted relationships
  # Consider completeness of the provenance chain
  return confidenceScore
end function
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems focus on *determining* public domain status. This system goes further by *tracking* the lifecycle of works, creating a richer understanding of their history and rights. This enables not just legal compliance, but also granular rights management, attribution, and creative reuse. The integration of AI-powered relationship extraction and dynamic confidence scoring adds a new layer of sophistication to the process.
