## Thread: Predictive Illumination & Augmented Reality Door View

**Concept:** A doorbell/door viewer system that proactively illuminates the entryway *based on predicted visitor intent*, overlaid with augmented reality information. This goes beyond simple motion detection and night vision.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution RGB camera with low-light capability (minimum 1080p, 30fps).
    *   Depth sensor (ToF or structured light) for accurate distance mapping and person/object segmentation.
    *   Microphone array for audio analysis.
    *   Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor for initial motion detection to conserve power.
*   **AI Core â€“ Predictive Modeling:**
    *   On-device AI processor (Neural Processing Unit - NPU) capable of running complex machine learning models.
    *   Model trained on a vast dataset of human behavior approaching doors (e.g., reaching for a doorknob, looking for a house number, carrying packages).
    *   Predictive algorithms determine *likelihood* of specific actions (e.g., attempting entry, delivering mail, simply passing by).
*   **Illumination System:**
    *   Array of individually addressable, high-CRI LEDs with adjustable color temperature and intensity.
    *   Adaptive illumination: Based on predicted intent, the system *highlights* relevant areas.
        *   If the visitor appears to be looking for a house number, illuminate the house number.
        *   If reaching for the doorknob, subtly illuminate the doorknob and surrounding area.
        *   If carrying a package, illuminate the area where the package will likely be placed.
    *   Anti-glare/diffusion filters to prevent blinding or annoyance.
*   **Augmented Reality Overlay (via companion app/optional integrated display):**
    *   Object Recognition: Identify common objects (packages, letters, people).
    *   Information Display:  Display relevant data over the live video feed.
        *   Package tracking information (if package is recognized).
        *   Facial recognition and name display (optional, user-configurable).
        *   Historical visitor data (e.g., "Last visited 3 days ago").
    *   AR Guidance: Project visual cues onto the entryway to aid visitors (e.g., highlighting a package drop-off zone).
*   **Power:**
    *   Wireless power transfer (Qi standard) for simplified installation.
    *   Battery backup for continued operation during power outages.
*   **Connectivity:**
    *   Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) for fast and reliable communication.
    *   Bluetooth 5.0 for local device connectivity.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. PIR sensor triggers initial motion detection
    if (motionDetected) {
        // 2. Activate Camera and Depth Sensor
        captureFrame();
        depthMap = getDepthMap();

        // 3. Run AI Model to predict intent
        intent = predictIntent(captureFrame(), depthMap);

        // 4. Adjust Illumination based on intent
        if (intent == "attempt_entry") {
            illuminate(doorknob_area, intensity=high);
        } else if (intent == "package_delivery") {
            illuminate(package_dropoff_area, intensity=medium);
        } else if (intent == "looking_for_house_number") {
            illuminate(house_number_area, intensity=low);
        } else {
            illuminate(entire_entryway, intensity=low); // Default
        }

        // 5. Update AR Overlay (if enabled)
        updateARDisplay(intent);
    }
}
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond passive surveillance to *anticipate* visitor needs and proactively enhance the entryway experience. The integration of predictive AI and augmented reality adds significant value beyond basic doorbell functionality. It's about creating a welcoming and *intelligent* entryway.
