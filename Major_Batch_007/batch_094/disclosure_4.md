## Dynamic Load Prioritization & Predictive Switching

**Concept:** Extend the ATSPSU to dynamically prioritize loads based on real-time operational needs and *predictively* switch between power sources *before* a complete failure occurs, optimizing for both uptime *and* energy efficiency. Current systems react to failures. This anticipates them.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Load Classification Module:**
    *   Hardware/Software component integrated with the ATSPSU controller.
    *   Requires user-defined load profiles (critical, important, non-critical).
    *   Loads connected to the DC bus bars are categorized via configuration or auto-discovery (current draw analysis, device identification where possible).
    *   Allows dynamic re-profiling of loads during operation.

2.  **Predictive Analytics Engine:**
    *   Software component running on the ATSPSU controller.
    *   Monitors *multiple* AC power source parameters (voltage, current, frequency, harmonic distortion, temperature of associated breakers).
    *   Employs time series analysis (Kalman filtering, ARIMA models) to *predict* potential power source degradation/failure.  The analytics engine will learn from historical data *and* current environmental factors.
    *   Uses machine learning (decision trees, neural networks) to correlate AC source data with DC load demands.

3.  **Adaptive Switching Algorithm:**
    *   Integrated with the Predictive Analytics Engine and Load Classification Module.
    *   *Before* a complete AC power source failure, the algorithm initiates a controlled switch to the secondary AC source. The switching criteria will be based on the predicted time to failure and the impact of load shedding on critical systems.
    *   Prioritizes load shedding based on load classification. Non-critical loads are shed first, followed by important loads, to preserve power for critical systems.
    *   Incorporates a "graceful shutdown" protocol for shed loads, allowing them to save data and shut down cleanly.

4.  **Energy Optimization Mode:**
    *   When the primary AC source is stable, the algorithm analyzes the load demand and switches to the secondary AC source to take advantage of lower energy costs or more efficient power generation (e.g., solar power when available).
    *   Dynamic load balancing between the two AC sources to minimize overall energy consumption.

5.  **Communication Interface:**
    *   Provides a communication interface (e.g., Ethernet, Modbus) for remote monitoring and control.
    *   Allows users to configure load profiles, set switching parameters, and view system status.
    *   Integration with Building Management Systems (BMS) for centralized control and monitoring.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Switching Algorithm):**

```
function AdaptiveSwitch() {
  // Get current AC source data
  primaryACData = GetACSourceData(primaryACSource);
  secondaryACData = GetACSourceData(secondaryACSource);

  // Predict primary AC source failure time
  predictedFailureTime = PredictFailure(primaryACData);

  // Determine if a switch is necessary
  if (predictedFailureTime < switchingThreshold) {
    // Prioritize load shedding
    shedNonCriticalLoads();
    if (predictedFailureTime < criticalThreshold) {
      shedImportantLoads();
    }

    // Switch to secondary AC source
    SwitchPowerSource(secondaryACSource);
  } else if (EnergyOptimizationMode && secondaryACSourceCost < primaryACSourceCost) {
    // Switch to secondary AC source for energy savings
    SwitchPowerSource(secondaryACSource);
  } else {
    // Maintain current power source
    MaintainPowerSource(primaryACSource);
  }
}

function PredictFailure(ACData) {
    //Implement time series analysis and machine learning models.
    //Returns estimated time until power failure in seconds.
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased processing power for the ATSPSU controller to handle predictive analytics.
*   Redundant communication interfaces for improved reliability.
*   High-speed switching relays for seamless power source transitions.
