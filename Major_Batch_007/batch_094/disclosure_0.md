## Dynamic Key Component Sharding & Temporal Access Control

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of splitting the authentication key into components, but introduce dynamic sharding and temporal access control for those components. Instead of a static split between setup code and manifest, the key components are dynamically generated and distributed *across multiple* client-side and server-side entities, with access windows determined by a policy engine.

**Specification:**

**1. Component Generation & Distribution:**

*   **Policy Engine:** A central policy engine defines the sharding scheme (number of components, size, distribution locations) and access control rules based on user roles, device characteristics, time of day, network conditions, and other contextual factors.
*   **Dynamic Sharding:** The authentication key is algorithmically broken into *n* components. *n* is determined by the policy engine.
*   **Component Destinations:**
    *   **Client-Side (Device 1):** Receives *x* components (determined by policy). Stored in a secure enclave or hardware security module (HSM).
    *   **Client-Side (Device 2, 3…):**  Subsequent devices receive other components, increasing the requirement for multi-factor authentication.
    *   **Trusted Server 1:** Receives *y* components.
    *   **Trusted Server 2:** Receives *z* components.
    *   **Ephemeral Server:** Receives a temporary component valid for a short duration. This adds a layer of temporal security.
*   **Delivery Channels:** Components are delivered via multiple channels – encrypted push notifications, secure API calls, QR codes, etc. – enhancing resilience against interception.

**2. Access Control & Validation:**

*   **Temporal Validity:** Each component has a defined validity period. Expired components are unusable.
*   **Contextual Access:** Access to a component is granted only when specific contextual conditions are met (e.g., user is on a trusted network, device is within a geo-fence).
*   **Multi-Factor Verification:** Authentication requires the coordinated retrieval and combination of components from multiple sources.
*   **Reconstruction Protocol:** A secure, multi-party computation (MPC) protocol is used to reconstruct the authentication key without exposing individual components. 

**3. Pseudocode (Client-Side - Device 1):**

```
function requestAuthentication() {
    // Initiate authentication request to server
    serverResponse = sendRequestToServer("authenticate");

    // Receive component retrieval instructions
    componentInstructions = serverResponse.componentInstructions;

    // Retrieve components as instructed
    component1 = retrieveComponent(componentInstructions.component1Source);
    component2 = retrieveComponent(componentInstructions.component2Source);

    // Check validity of components
    if (!isValidComponent(component1) || !isValidComponent(component2)) {
        // Handle invalid component (e.g., request new components)
        return false;
    }

    // Initiate MPC with other parties
    mpcResult = initiateMPC(component1, component2, otherPartyAddresses);

    //If MPC is successful, authentication is complete
    if (mpcResult.success) {
      return true;
    }

    return false;
}

function retrieveComponent(source) {
    // Retrieve component from specified source (e.g., secure API call, QR code scan)
    // Implement appropriate security measures to protect the component during retrieval
    component = getComponent(source);
    return component;
}
```

**4. Infrastructure Components:**

*   **Policy Engine:** Rule-based engine to define sharding and access control policies.
*   **Component Storage:** Secure storage for key components (HSM, encrypted database).
*   **MPC Coordinator:** Service to manage the MPC process.
*   **Component Delivery Services:** APIs and protocols for delivering components to clients.



This approach moves beyond static key splitting to a dynamic, context-aware authentication system, offering greater flexibility and security. It necessitates more complex infrastructure but provides a significantly enhanced security posture.
