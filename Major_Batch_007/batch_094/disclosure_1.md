## Dynamic Object Sharding & Federated Queries

**Specification:** Implement a system for automatically sharding complex hierarchical objects across multiple storage nodes, coupled with a federated query engine capable of reconstructing the object on-demand and executing functions across shards in parallel.

**Core Concept:** Extend the hierarchical object query concept to a distributed environment. Instead of loading and manipulating the entire object in memory, the system dynamically shards the object based on access patterns and function requirements.  

**Components:**

1.  **Sharding Engine:**
    *   Analyzes object hierarchy and access patterns (determined via instrumentation or profiling).
    *   Divides the object into smaller "shards," each containing a subtree of the hierarchy.
    *   Distributes shards across a cluster of storage nodes.
    *   Maintains a metadata map indicating the location of each shard.

2.  **Federated Query Engine:**
    *   Receives a query (function + parameters) for an object.
    *   Decomposes the query into sub-queries executable on individual shards.
    *   Distributes sub-queries to the appropriate storage nodes.
    *   Aggregates the results from each shard to form the final result.

3.  **Virtual Object Assembler:**
    *   Reconstructs a virtual representation of the object on-demand by fetching shards as needed.
    *   Optimizes shard retrieval based on query requirements.
    *   Handles concurrency and data consistency.

**Pseudocode (Query Execution):**

```
function execute_query(query, object_id):
  // 1. Analyze query and identify required shards
  shards = analyze_query(query, object_id)

  // 2. Fetch shards (potentially in parallel)
  fetched_shards = fetch_shards(shards)

  // 3. Execute function on shards (parallel execution)
  partial_results = parallel_map(shard, apply_function(shard, query.parameters))

  // 4. Aggregate partial results
  final_result = aggregate_results(partial_results, query)

  // 5. Return final result
  return final_result
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Shard:**  A subtree of the hierarchical object, serialized and stored as a blob.  Includes metadata (shard ID, parent object ID, access statistics).
*   **Metadata Map:** A distributed hash table mapping shard IDs to storage node locations.
*   **Query Plan:**  A tree representing the decomposition of the query into sub-queries and the order of execution.

**Novelty:**

The patent focuses on querying *within* a single object. This specification outlines a system for distributing the object itself, enabling scalability and parallel processing of complex hierarchical data. It moves beyond single-object manipulation to a distributed object system where the object *is* the distributed unit. This is particularly relevant for large, complex objects (e.g., CAD models, scientific datasets) where loading the entire object into memory is impractical.
