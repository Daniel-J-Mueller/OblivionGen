## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning with Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** Expand upon the multi-speaker control concept by introducing dynamic acoustic zoning influenced by real-time biofeedback from users within the environment. This moves beyond simply controlling *where* audio plays, to actively shaping the sonic experience based on individual and collective physiological states.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-speaker array (existing foundation).
    *   Wearable biofeedback sensors (heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), EEG – optional). Wireless connectivity (Bluetooth Low Energy preferred).
    *   Central processing unit (capable of real-time data analysis and zone control). Edge computing preferred for low latency.
    *   Microphone array for ambient sound analysis and voice command recognition (as in the base patent).
*   **Software:**
    *   **Biofeedback Data Acquisition Module:** Receives and preprocesses data from wearable sensors. Noise filtering, artifact rejection, and data normalization.
    *   **Physiological State Inference Engine:** Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks) to infer user’s emotional and cognitive states (e.g., relaxation, focus, stress, excitement) based on biofeedback data.
    *   **Acoustic Zoning Algorithm:** Dynamically adjusts speaker volume and equalization profiles within predefined zones based on inferred physiological states.
        *   **Relaxation Mode:** Emphasizes ambient soundscapes, low frequencies, and gentle volume levels. Zone focus shifts to create a ‘personal bubble’ of calm around relaxed users.
        *   **Focus Mode:** Prioritizes clarity and directional sound. Volume increases in zones surrounding focused users. Noise cancellation activated in surrounding zones.
        *   **Excitement Mode:** Amplifies bass frequencies and dynamic range. Volume increases across all zones to create an immersive experience.
        *   **Stress Reduction Mode:** Plays calming soundscapes and binaural beats. Volume decreases and equalization shifts to minimize harsh frequencies.
    *   **Zone Definition Interface:** Allows users to define zones within the environment (e.g., living room, kitchen, bedroom) and associate them with specific users or profiles.
    *   **Voice Command Integration:** Integrates with existing voice command system to allow users to manually adjust zones, profiles, and audio settings.
    *   **Collective Awareness Module:** Analyzes aggregate biofeedback data from multiple users to identify dominant emotional states within the environment and adjust acoustic zoning accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Acoustic Zoning Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION AdjustAcousticZoning(userBiofeedbackData, zoneDefinition, currentAudioSettings)

  // Infer Physiological State
  physiologicalState = InferState(userBiofeedbackData)

  // Determine Zone Adjustments based on State
  IF physiologicalState == "Relaxation" THEN
    zoneVolume = ReduceVolume(zoneDefinition)
    zoneEQ = EnhanceAmbientFrequencies(zoneEQ)
  ELSE IF physiologicalState == "Focus" THEN
    zoneVolume = IncreaseVolume(zoneDefinition)
    zoneEQ = EnhanceClarity(zoneEQ)
  ELSE IF physiologicalState == "Excitement" THEN
    zoneVolume = IncreaseVolume(zoneDefinition)
    zoneEQ = EnhanceBass(zoneEQ)
  ELSE IF physiologicalState == "Stress" THEN
    zoneVolume = ReduceVolume(zoneDefinition)
    zoneEQ = ReduceHarshFrequencies(zoneEQ)
  ENDIF

  // Apply Zone Adjustments to Speakers
  FOR EACH speaker IN zoneDefinition
    speaker.volume = zoneVolume
    speaker.EQ = zoneEQ
  ENDFOR

  RETURN updatedAudioSettings
END FUNCTION

**Potential Applications:**

*   Home entertainment systems
*   Office environments
*   Healthcare facilities (stress reduction, pain management)
*   Virtual reality/augmented reality experiences
*   Automotive interiors (driver alertness monitoring, passenger comfort)
