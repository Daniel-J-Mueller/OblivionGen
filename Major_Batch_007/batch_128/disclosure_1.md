## Dynamic Spatial Audio Grouping

**Concept:** Leverage the smart floor tile network not just for *identifying* groups, but for dynamically creating localized, immersive audio experiences *for* those groups.  Instead of merely tracking who is "together", use the system to spatially distribute audio tailored to the group's interactions or location.

**Specifications:**

*   **Tile Hardware Additions:** Each smart floor tile incorporates a miniature, directional speaker array (minimum 4 speakers per tile) capable of beamforming.  Each tile also includes a low-power microphone array for ambient noise cancellation and potentially, localized voice pickup.
*   **Server-Side Audio Engine:** A dedicated audio processing component within the server handles the mixing, spatialization, and distribution of audio streams. This engine supports:
    *   **Real-time Audio Input:** Accepts audio streams from various sources (e.g., a central server, individual user devices via Bluetooth/WiFi, live microphone feeds).
    *   **Spatial Audio Algorithms:** Employs algorithms (e.g., Ambisonics, Vector Base Amplitude Panning) to create 3D audio experiences.
    *   **Group Mapping:** Integrates with the existing group identification system.  Assigns audio streams to specific groups based on tile data.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   Tiles communicate audio data to the server via the existing network infrastructure.
    *   Server distributes spatial audio parameters (pan, volume, equalization) to individual tiles.
    *   Tiles apply these parameters to the received audio stream before playback.
*   **Pseudocode - Server Side:**

```
function processGroupAudio(groupData, audioStream) {
  // groupData contains: groupID, memberTileIDs, locationData
  // audioStream is the input audio

  for each tileID in memberTileIDs {
    // Calculate spatial audio parameters based on tile location,
    // member relative positions, and desired effect.
    spatialParams = calculateSpatialParams(tileID, memberTileIDs, groupData.locationData);

    // Send spatial parameters and audio data to the tile.
    sendToTile(tileID, spatialParams, audioStream);
  }
}

function calculateSpatialParams(tileID, memberTileIDs, locationData) {
  // This function would implement the spatial audio algorithms.
  // It would determine pan, volume, and equalization based on:
  // - Tile position in relation to other tiles in the group.
  // - Desired audio effect (e.g., directional sound, sound source localization).
  // - Ambient noise levels at the tile location.

  //Placeholder for algorithm. Returns dummy values.
  pan = random(-1, 1);
  volume = 0.5;

  return { pan: pan, volume: volume };
}

```

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Retail Environments:** Dynamic advertising tailored to groups browsing specific products.  Audio "follows" the group as they move through the store.
    *   **Museums/Exhibits:**  Localized audio guides that automatically activate as a group approaches an exhibit.
    *   **Educational Settings:**  Interactive group learning experiences.  Audio prompts and feedback tailored to the group's progress.
    *   **Gaming/Entertainment:** Immersive, spatially-aware gaming experiences.
    *   **Accessibility:**  Directional audio cues for visually impaired users.
