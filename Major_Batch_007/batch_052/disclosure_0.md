## Adaptive Graph Resolution with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical clustering to incorporate a temporal aspect, allowing the graph to dynamically adjust resolution based on the "age" of clusters and the rate of new data integration. This goes beyond fixed-bandwidth k-NN and aims for a self-organizing, evolving representation.

**Specs:**

1.  **Cluster Age Tracking:** Each node (representing a merged cluster) will have an associated “age” counter. This counter is initialized to zero upon cluster formation (initial k-NN nodes) and incremented with each iteration *without* merging.  A merge resets the age to zero, forming a new cluster.

2.  **Decay Factor (α):** A tunable parameter (0 < α < 1) defining the rate at which cluster age impacts graph resolution.  Higher α means faster decay and more frequent resolution adjustment.

3.  **Age-Weighted Edge Probability:** Modify the linkage probability calculation. The standard probability is multiplied by a decay factor: `P' = P * exp(-α * age)`. This reduces the linkage probability of older clusters, encouraging them to be re-evaluated and potentially split.

4.  **Dynamic k-Value Adjustment:** Implement a function that modulates the ‘k’ value in the k-NN graph construction based on the average age of existing clusters. As average age increases, *increase* k. This expands the neighborhood search and encourages larger-scale structure formation.  This function can be linear, exponential, or any other suitable relationship.

    *   `k' = k_base + β * avg_age` (where β is a scaling factor)

5.  **Node Splitting Criterion:** Introduce a splitting criterion. If a node’s “internal variance” (a measure of dissimilarity between the nodes it represents – e.g., average distance to the cluster centroid) exceeds a threshold *and* its age exceeds a second threshold, the node is flagged for splitting.  Splitting involves reverting the node back to its constituent nodes from the previous iteration, initiating a new round of clustering within that region.

6.  **Real-time Data Integration:** When new data points arrive, they are immediately added as individual nodes to the graph.  The k-NN graph is reconstructed *locally* around the new nodes, and the linkage/density probabilities are calculated.  The age of these new nodes is 0.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
graph = create_knn_graph(data, k)
node_ages = initialize_ages(graph) // All nodes start at 0
alpha = 0.1  // Decay factor
beta = 0.05 // k-value scaling factor
k_base = 5 // Base k-value
split_variance_threshold = 0.2
split_age_threshold = 10

// Iterative Clustering
while not converged:

    // Calculate Linkage and Density Probabilities
    linkage_probs, density_probs = calculate_probabilities(graph)

    // Apply Age-Weighted Edge Probability
    for edge in graph.edges:
        edge.probability *= exp(-alpha * node_ages[edge.source])

    // Adjust k-value
    avg_age = calculate_average_node_age(node_ages)
    k_current = k_base + beta * avg_age

    // Merge nodes
    new_graph = merge_nodes(graph, linkage_probs, density_probs)
    graph = new_graph

    // Update node ages
    node_ages = update_node_ages(graph, node_ages)

    // Check for splitting
    for node in graph.nodes:
        if node.internal_variance > split_variance_threshold and node.age > split_age_threshold:
            split_node(node)

    // Integrate new data (if available)
    new_data = get_new_data()
    if new_data:
        add_new_data(new_data, graph)
        node_ages = update_node_ages(graph, node_ages)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:** Clusters with high age and variance might indicate anomalous behavior.
*   **Dynamic Network Analysis:**  Tracking the evolution of clusters over time.
*   **Real-time Data Streams:**  Adapting to changing data distributions.
