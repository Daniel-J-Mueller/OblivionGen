## Adaptive Payload Combustion System for UAV Swarms

**Concept:** Develop a modular, standardized combustion engine ‘pod’ system for UAVs, designed for rapid interchange and optimized for varying payload weights and flight profiles within a swarm context. This system moves beyond simply providing redundant power; it allows dynamic re-configuration of a swarm’s capabilities *in-flight*.

**Specifications:**

*   **Engine Pod:** Cylindrical housing, 20cm diameter, 30cm length. Constructed from high-strength, lightweight composite material. Standardized mounting points (quick-release magnetic locking mechanism) compatible with all swarm UAV models.
*   **Fuel System:** Small, sealed, interchangeable fuel cartridges (lithium-based gel fuel – increased energy density & safety) with integrated fuel level sensors. Cartridge capacity: 500ml.
*   **Engine Type:** Miniature turbine engine (ducted fan configuration for noise reduction & efficiency) generating 5kW peak power. Integrated electronic throttle control.
*   **Generator:** High-efficiency, lightweight axial flux generator coupled directly to the turbine engine. Output: 24V DC, 10A continuous.
*   **Communication:** Wireless communication module (Bluetooth/Zigbee) for remote monitoring (fuel level, engine temperature, power output) and control (throttle adjustment).
*   **Weight:**  Approximately 2.5kg (including fuel cartridge).
*   **Modular Payload Integration:**  Each engine pod incorporates a standardized payload bay (10cm x 10cm x 10cm) capable of accepting various sensor packages, communication relays, or small effectors.
*   **Swarm Integration Software:**
    *   *Dynamic Power Allocation:* Algorithm to intelligently distribute power across the swarm based on individual UAV requirements (sensor usage, flight path, payload).
    *   *In-Flight Reconfiguration:* Software allows the swarm operator to remotely swap engine pod functionality (e.g., replace a power-focused pod with a sensor-focused pod) without landing.
    *   *Pod Health Monitoring:* Continuous monitoring of all pod parameters (fuel level, temperature, power output) with automated fault detection and reporting.
    *   *Geofenced Power Control:* Automatic adjustment of power output based on location (e.g., reduced power in restricted airspace).

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Power Allocation):**

```
// UAV Swarm Data Structure
struct UAV {
  int id;
  float batteryLevel;
  float estimatedFlightTime;
  bool isCritical; // Flag for emergency/mission-critical status
  int payloadPowerDemand; // Watts
  float latitude;
  float longitude;
}

// Function to calculate power needs for a UAV
float calculateUAVPowerNeeds(UAV uav) {
  return uav.payloadPowerDemand + (uav.estimatedFlightTime * basePowerConsumption);
}

// Function to allocate power from combustion engine pods
void allocatePower(UAV[] swarm, CombustionEnginePod[] pods) {
  // Calculate total power demand of the swarm
  float totalDemand = 0;
  for (UAV uav : swarm) {
    totalDemand += calculateUAVPowerNeeds(uav);
  }

  // Sort UAVs by criticality (highest priority first)
  sort(swarm, byCriticality);

  // Iterate through UAVs and allocate power from available pods
  for (UAV uav : swarm) {
    float requiredPower = calculateUAVPowerNeeds(uav);
    float allocatedPower = 0;

    // Iterate through available pods
    for (CombustionEnginePod pod : pods) {
      if (pod.availablePower > 0) {
        float powerToAllocate = min(pod.availablePower, requiredPower - allocatedPower);
        pod.availablePower -= powerToAllocate;
        allocatedPower += powerToAllocate;
      }
    }

    // If power allocation failed, flag UAV for emergency landing
    if (allocatedPower < requiredPower) {
      uav.isCritical = true;
    }
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond simply *extending* flight time.  The modularity and dynamic allocation create a truly adaptable swarm, capable of shifting power and functionality *in-flight* based on mission needs and unforeseen circumstances. The swarm becomes a distributed network of adaptable power and sensor nodes.
