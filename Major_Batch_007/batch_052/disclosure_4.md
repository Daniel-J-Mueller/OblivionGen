## Dynamic Authentication Thresholds & Predictive Security

**Concept:** Instead of a static ‘automatic authentication’ setting, implement a dynamic authentication threshold based on behavioral biometrics, transaction value, and contextual risk analysis. This moves beyond simple cookie-based authentication and incorporates continuous security assessment.

**Specs:**

1.  **Behavioral Biometric Engine:**
    *   Capture user interaction data: keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scroll patterns, typing speed, device orientation, network characteristics.
    *   Establish baseline profiles for each user using machine learning.
    *   Real-time anomaly detection: Flag deviations from the baseline.
2.  **Transaction Risk Scoring:**
    *   Assign risk scores to transactions based on:
        *   Amount: Higher values = higher risk.
        *   Item Category: Certain categories (e.g., electronics, luxury goods) = higher risk.
        *   Time of Day/Location: Unusual activity based on user history = higher risk.
        *   Recipient/Seller Reputation: Based on historical data and ratings = higher risk.
3.  **Dynamic Authentication Level:**
    *   Authentication levels:
        *   Level 1: No authentication (for very low-risk transactions).
        *   Level 2: Cookie-based authentication.
        *   Level 3: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) – SMS code, authenticator app, etc.
        *   Level 4: Biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition).
    *   Risk score determines authentication level.
    *   Adaptive Authentication: System *predicts* likelihood of fraudulent activity. If the prediction is high, authentication level is increased *before* the transaction is completed.
4.  **Predictive Modeling & Machine Learning:**
    *   Continuous learning based on transaction data and user behavior.
    *   Identify emerging fraud patterns.
    *   Adjust risk thresholds automatically.
5.  **System Architecture:**
    *   Authentication Service: Centralized service responsible for user authentication.
    *   Behavioral Analytics Engine: Processes behavioral data and generates risk scores.
    *   Transaction Monitoring System: Monitors transactions and triggers authentication requests.
    *   User Profile Database: Stores user data, behavioral profiles, and authentication settings.
6.  **Pseudocode (Authentication Flow):**

```
FUNCTION authenticateTransaction(transactionData, userIdentifier):
    riskScore = calculateRiskScore(transactionData)
    behavioralScore = getBehavioralScore(userIdentifier)
    combinedScore = riskScore + behavioralScore

    IF combinedScore < LOW_THRESHOLD:
        authenticationLevel = LEVEL_1  // No authentication
    ELSE IF combinedScore < MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
        authenticationLevel = LEVEL_2  // Cookie-based
    ELSE IF combinedScore < HIGH_THRESHOLD:
        authenticationLevel = LEVEL_3  // MFA
    ELSE:
        authenticationLevel = LEVEL_4  // Biometric

    SWITCH authenticationLevel:
        CASE LEVEL_1:
            ALLOW_TRANSACTION()
        CASE LEVEL_2:
            VERIFY_COOKIE()
            IF COOKIE_VALID():
                ALLOW_TRANSACTION()
            ELSE:
                REQUEST_MFA()
        CASE LEVEL_3:
            REQUEST_MFA()
            IF MFA_SUCCESSFUL():
                ALLOW_TRANSACTION()
            ELSE:
                DENY_TRANSACTION()
        CASE LEVEL_4:
            REQUEST_BIOMETRIC_AUTHENTICATION()
            IF BIOMETRIC_AUTHENTICATION_SUCCESSFUL():
                ALLOW_TRANSACTION()
            ELSE:
                DENY_TRANSACTION()
```

7.  **Data Storage:**
    *   Encrypted storage of all user data and behavioral profiles.
    *   Compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA).
