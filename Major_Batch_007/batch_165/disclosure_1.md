## Adaptive Resource Allocation Based on Predicted Cognitive Load

**Concept:** Extend the proactive limitation of app functionality to dynamically adjust resource allocation (CPU, memory, network) *within* an application based on predicted user cognitive load. This moves beyond simply limiting/deactivating an app entirely.

**Inspiration:** The patent’s focus on user usage patterns and proactive limitation. This idea expands that to *internal* app behavior.

**Specs:**

**1. Cognitive Load Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time user interaction data (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, touch patterns, eye-tracking data – if available, voice inflection/pace if the user is verbally interacting with the device), application state (current task, data being processed), and historical user performance data.
*   **Processing:** Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on a dataset of user interaction patterns correlated with cognitive load measurements (e.g., pupil dilation, EEG data – gathered during initial calibration or opt-in data collection).  The LSTM predicts a 'Cognitive Load Score' (CLS) ranging from 0 (low load) to 100 (high load).  Include an adaptive learning component to personalize the CLS prediction for each user profile.
*   **Output:** Real-time CLS value.

**2. Resource Allocation Manager:**

*   **Input:** CLS value from the Cognitive Load Prediction Module, application resource usage (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), application priority (user-defined or system-determined).
*   **Processing:** Implement a tiered resource allocation system:
    *   **Tier 1 (CLS 0-30):**  Default resource allocation. Application operates at full capacity.
    *   **Tier 2 (CLS 31-60):**  Moderate resource reduction.  Reduce non-critical background processes, lower frame rates for visually intensive applications, compress data before transmission, utilize less computationally expensive algorithms where possible.
    *   **Tier 3 (CLS 61-80):**  Significant resource reduction.  Defer non-essential tasks, prioritize essential data processing, severely limit visual effects, utilize highly compressed data formats, and limit network activity.
    *   **Tier 4 (CLS 81-100):**  Minimal resource allocation.  Restrict application to core functionality only.  Display a clear message to the user indicating high cognitive load and simplified functionality.
*   **Output:** Dynamically adjusted resource allocation parameters for the application.

**3. Application Integration Interface (API):**

*   Provide a standardized API that allows applications to query the current CLS value and receive notifications when the resource allocation changes.
*   The API should include functions for applications to gracefully adapt to reduced resource availability (e.g., lower image quality, simplified UI).

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Manager):**

```
function adjustResources(application, cls):
  if cls <= 30:
    application.setResources(defaultResources)
  else if cls <= 60:
    application.setResources(moderateResources)
  else if cls <= 80:
    application.setResources(significantResources)
  else:
    application.setResources(minimalResources)
    displayMessage("High Cognitive Load - Functionality Limited")
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   This system can operate on existing hardware. However, optimized performance will be achieved with devices equipped with dedicated neural processing units (NPUs) for faster cognitive load prediction.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Improving user experience in demanding applications (e.g., gaming, video editing).
*   Enhancing safety in critical applications (e.g., autonomous driving, medical devices).
*   Reducing cognitive overload in learning environments.
*   Providing personalized user interfaces that adapt to individual cognitive abilities.
