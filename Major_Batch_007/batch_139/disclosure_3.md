## Adaptive Coherency Domains via Programmable Interconnect

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This design extends the concept of coherent agents to create dynamically configurable coherency domains. Rather than fixed coherency fabrics, this system utilizes a programmable interconnect – a network of configurable switches and links – to establish and dissolve coherency domains on demand. This allows for fine-grained control over data sharing and isolation, improving performance and security in heterogeneous computing environments.

**II. Components:**

1.  **Coherency Domain Controller (CDC):** A dedicated processor responsible for managing the programmable interconnect and establishing/dissolving coherency domains. It receives requests from applications or system software specifying desired data sharing configurations.

2.  **Programmable Interconnect:** A network of configurable switches and high-bandwidth links. Each link supports a coherency protocol (e.g., MESI, CHI) and allows for configurable bandwidth allocation. The switches learn network topology and optimize data routing based on CDC instructions.

3.  **Adaptive Coherent Agents (ACAs):** Enhanced versions of the coherent agents described in the reference patent. ACAs can dynamically join or leave coherency domains based on instructions from the CDC. They support multiple coherency protocols and can adapt to varying network topologies. ACAs maintain state information not just for data, but also for *domain membership* – which domains they are currently participating in.

4.  **Data Partitioning Engine (DPE):** A hardware module that can dynamically partition data into segments, each assigned to a specific coherency domain. This allows for selective sharing of data, improving security and reducing coherency overhead.

**III. Operation:**

1.  **Domain Request:** An application or system software sends a request to the CDC, specifying a desired data sharing configuration (e.g., “Establish a coherency domain for components A, B, and C with access to data segment X”).

2.  **Interconnect Configuration:** The CDC programs the programmable interconnect to establish a coherency domain connecting the specified components. This involves configuring switches to route coherency traffic between the components and allocating bandwidth as needed.

3.  **ACA Membership:** The CDC instructs the ACAs associated with the components to join the new coherency domain. The ACAs update their domain membership state and begin participating in coherency transactions within the domain.

4.  **Data Partitioning (Optional):** The DPE partitions data based on domain membership. Data segments assigned to a particular domain are accessible only to ACAs participating in that domain.

5.  **Dynamic Adaptation:** The CDC can dynamically adjust the coherency domain configuration based on application needs or system load. This involves reconfiguring the programmable interconnect, updating ACA membership, and repartitioning data.

**IV. Pseudocode (CDC – Domain Creation):**

```pseudocode
function CreateDomain(componentList, dataSegmentList):
    // componentList: List of components to include in the domain
    // dataSegmentList: List of data segments to share within the domain

    // 1. Configure Interconnect
    interconnect.Configure(componentList, dataSegmentList)

    // 2. Update ACA Membership
    for each component in componentList:
        component.ACA.JoinDomain(this.DomainID)

    // 3. (Optional) Partition Data
    for each dataSegment in dataSegmentList:
        DPE.AssignSegmentToDomain(dataSegment, this.DomainID)

    return Success
```

**V. Innovation:**

This design moves beyond static coherency fabrics to create dynamically adaptable coherency domains. This allows for improved performance, security, and flexibility in heterogeneous computing environments. The ability to partition data at the hardware level further enhances security and reduces coherency overhead. The use of a programmable interconnect enables fine-grained control over data sharing and isolation, opening up new possibilities for application optimization.
