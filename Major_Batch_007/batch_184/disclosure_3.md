## Adaptive Resonance Charging Cradle

**Concept:** A charging cradle incorporating resonant inductive coupling, dynamically adjusting frequency to maximize power transfer and utilizing a spatial awareness system for optimized positioning and multi-device support.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Technology:** Resonant Inductive Charging – Employ a multi-coil array within the cradle base. Each coil operates at a slightly different resonant frequency.
*   **Spatial Awareness:** Integrated Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor array – maps the location and orientation of devices placed on or near the cradle surface. Data is fed into a microcontroller for dynamic frequency selection and power allocation.
*   **Frequency Tuning:** Microcontroller-driven signal generator – sweeps through a range of frequencies for each coil, identifying the resonant peak for optimal power transfer to the device. Algorithm prioritizes highest efficiency transfer.
*   **Multi-Device Support:** Algorithm identifies multiple devices – allocating power based on device priority (user defined in a companion app) and dynamically adjusting coil activation/frequency to avoid interference.
*   **Cradle Surface:** Modular hexagonal tile design – Tiles incorporate both inductive charging coils and the ToF sensors. Allows for expanding the charging area and customizing the cradle shape. Tiles are wirelessly interconnected for data and power distribution.
*   **Power Supply:** High-efficiency GaN power adapter – Supports Power Delivery (PD) standard, capable of dynamically adjusting voltage and current based on connected devices.
*   **Housing:**  Aluminum alloy chassis with integrated cooling fins – Provides structural support and dissipates heat generated by the inductive coils.
*   **Connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.0 – Enables communication with a companion app for user customization, monitoring, and firmware updates. Wi-Fi connectivity for over-the-air updates and remote monitoring.
*   **Companion App:** User interface for:
    *   Device prioritization
    *   Charging status monitoring
    *   Firmware updates
    *   Customization of cradle layout (tile arrangement)
    *   Data logging (charging history, energy consumption)

**Pseudocode (Frequency Tuning & Power Allocation):**

```
// Initialize coils and ToF sensors

Loop:
  Scan for devices using ToF sensors //Get position/orientation
  For each device:
    For each coil:
      Transmit signal at frequency 'f'
      Measure received power 'P'
      If P > threshold AND P > max(P_other_coils):
        Optimal_Coil = current_coil
        Optimal_Frequency = f
      Increment f
    Activate Optimal_Coil at Optimal_Frequency
    Allocate power based on device priority and battery level.
  If new device detected:
    Re-scan all devices
    Re-allocate power

Delay(1 second)
Goto Loop
```

**Novelty:**

This isn't simply a wireless charger. The dynamic frequency tuning and spatial awareness system allow for optimized charging efficiency, multi-device support, and adaptable surface area. The hexagonal tile design provides a modular and customizable charging solution.
