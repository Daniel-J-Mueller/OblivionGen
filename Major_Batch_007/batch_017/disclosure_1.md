## Dynamic Aesthetic Profiling via Multi-Sensory Input

**Specification:** A system to expand user preference modeling beyond visual color palettes to encompass broader aesthetic profiles informed by multi-sensory data – audio, texture, and even scent – to generate richer, more nuanced social recommendations.

**Core Concept:** The current patent focuses heavily on visual color palettes. This builds on that by recognizing that ‘aesthetic preference’ is far more complex and multi-faceted.  A user's complete aesthetic can be mapped through a combination of sensory inputs, not just color.

**System Components:**

1.  **Multi-Sensory Input Module:**
    *   **Audio Analysis:** Analyze user-selected music (streaming services integration) for qualities like tempo, key, instrumentation, and “mood” (valence/arousal).
    *   **Texture Mapping:**  Allow users to upload images of textures they like (e.g., wood grain, fabric) or select from a predefined library.  Image analysis will extract texture features (roughness, pattern, complexity).
    *   **Scent Association (Optional):** Integrate with “smart scent” devices (if/when they become widely available) or utilize user-provided scent descriptions (e.g., "cedarwood," "ocean breeze").  Utilize semantic understanding of scent descriptions.
    *   **Visual Input (Existing):** Continue to utilize the existing image-based color palette analysis.

2.  **Aesthetic Vector Generation:**
    *   Combine data from all sensory inputs into a high-dimensional "aesthetic vector." This vector represents the user’s complete aesthetic profile.
    *   Employ machine learning (specifically, dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or UMAP) to map the high-dimensional aesthetic vector into a more manageable space for comparison.

3.  **User Similarity Engine:**
    *   Compare aesthetic vectors of different users to identify those with similar preferences.
    *   Utilize a distance metric (e.g., cosine similarity) to quantify the similarity between aesthetic vectors.

4.  **Recommendation Engine:**
    *   Generate recommendations based on user similarity. This could include:
        *   **Content Recommendations:** Suggest images, music, textures, or even virtual environments that align with the user’s aesthetic profile.
        *   **Social Recommendations:** Connect users with similar aesthetic profiles.
        *   **Product Recommendations:** Suggest products (clothing, furniture, art) that match the user’s aesthetic.

**Pseudocode (User Similarity Calculation):**

```
function calculate_user_similarity(user1_aesthetic_vector, user2_aesthetic_vector):
  # Calculate cosine similarity between the two vectors
  dot_product = sum(user1_aesthetic_vector * user2_aesthetic_vector)
  magnitude_user1 = sqrt(sum(user1_aesthetic_vector * user1_aesthetic_vector))
  magnitude_user2 = sqrt(sum(user2_aesthetic_vector * user2_aesthetic_vector))

  if magnitude_user1 == 0 or magnitude_user2 == 0:
    return 0  # Handle cases where one or both vectors are zero

  similarity = dot_product / (magnitude_user1 * magnitude_user2)
  return similarity
```

**Data Structure (Aesthetic Vector Example):**

```
aesthetic_vector = {
  "color_palette": [0.2, 0.8, 0.1, 0.9], #RGB + Alpha
  "audio_tempo": 120, # BPM
  "audio_valence": 0.7, # 0-1
  "audio_arousal": 0.6, # 0-1
  "texture_roughness": 0.3, # 0-1
  "texture_pattern_complexity": 0.5 # 0-1
  # ... more features
}
```

**Novelty:** This expands the scope of aesthetic profiling beyond visual elements to encompass a broader range of sensory experiences, creating a more nuanced and accurate representation of user preferences. This offers opportunities for more personalized and engaging recommendations.
