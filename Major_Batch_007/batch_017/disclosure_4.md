**Proactive Data ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Error Resolution**

**Specification:** A system that preemptively duplicates data migration processes in a ‘shadow’ environment *before* initiating the primary migration, utilizing predictive analysis to identify & resolve potential errors *before* they impact the live migration.

**Components:**

*   **Shadow Migration Engine:** A near-identical replica of the data migration service, operating on a parallel data pipeline.  Receives the same migration instructions as the primary process.
*   **Predictive Error Analysis Module:**  A machine learning model trained on historical migration data (errors, data types, source/target schemas, network conditions, etc.). It analyzes migration instructions *before* execution in either environment.
*   **Data Reconciliation Engine:** Continuously compares the data state of the shadow environment vs. a ‘golden’ source data snapshot. Discrepancies flag potential issues.
*   **Automated Resolution Library:** A repository of pre-defined scripts/actions for common migration errors (schema mismatches, data type conversions, constraint violations, etc.).
*   **Performance Profiler:** Monitors resource usage (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) in both environments to identify bottlenecks.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Migration Instruction Reception:**  The system receives a data migration request (source, target, schema mappings, transformation rules).
2.  **Predictive Analysis:** The Predictive Error Analysis Module analyzes the migration instructions.  It generates a “risk score” indicating the likelihood of errors.
3.  **Shadow Migration Initiation:**  If the risk score exceeds a threshold, a shadow migration is initiated. This runs in parallel with the primary migration preparation.
4.  **Real-time Data Reconciliation:**  The Data Reconciliation Engine compares data in the shadow environment with the golden source snapshot.
5.  **Automated Error Resolution:** If discrepancies are detected, the Automated Resolution Library attempts to correct the errors in the shadow environment.
6.  **Primary Migration Execution:** Once the shadow migration is validated (data reconciled, errors resolved), the primary migration begins.
7.  **Adaptive Migration:** During the primary migration, the system uses the performance data from the shadow run to dynamically adjust resource allocation and optimize the migration process.
8.  **Post-Migration Validation:** A final data reconciliation step confirms the integrity of the migrated data.

**Pseudocode (Error Resolution Library):**

```
function resolveError(errorType, sourceData, targetData, schemaMapping) {
    switch (errorType) {
        case "SCHEMA_MISMATCH":
            // Attempt to automatically adjust the schema
            adjustedData = applySchemaAdjustment(sourceData, schemaMapping);
            return adjustedData;
        case "DATA_TYPE_CONVERSION":
            // Attempt to convert the data to the correct type
            convertedData = convertDataType(sourceData, targetDataType);
            return convertedData;
        case "CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION":
            // Attempt to modify the data to satisfy the constraint
            modifiedData = modifyDataForConstraint(sourceData, constraint);
            return modifiedData;
        default:
            // Log the error and flag for manual intervention
            logError(errorType, sourceData);
            return null; // Indicates resolution failure
    }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `MigrationInstruction`: {source: string, target: string, schemaMapping: object, transformationRules: array}
*   `ErrorLog`: {timestamp: datetime, errorType: string, sourceData: string, targetData: string}
*   `RiskScore`: {overallScore: float, schemaRisk: float, dataRisk: float, networkRisk: float}

**Potential Benefits:** Reduced migration failures, improved data integrity, faster migration times, proactive error resolution.
