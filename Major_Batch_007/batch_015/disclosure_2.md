## Dynamic Item Reservation & Geofenced Auction Integration

**Concept:** Expand the message-based purchasing system to facilitate micro-auctions triggered by proximity to a physical location. Combine this with dynamic item reservation tied to user intent signaled through the initial “request code” action.

**Specifications:**

**I. System Architecture Additions:**

1.  **Geofencing Module:**
    *   Input: Coordinates defining geographical boundaries.
    *   Function: Detects when a user’s communication device enters or exits a defined geofence.  Relies on device location services (with user permission).
    *   Output: Trigger signal to Auction Management System.

2.  **Auction Management System (AMS):**
    *   Input: Geofence trigger, item ID, current price (initially set at listing price), time remaining (configurable).
    *   Function:  Initiates a limited-duration auction for the item.  Receives bids via SMS or app.
    *   Output: Winning bid price, user ID, item ID.

3.  **Dynamic Reservation Engine (DRE):**
    *   Input: User selection of "request code," item ID, estimated delivery radius, auction participation status.
    *   Function:  Temporarily reserves the item for the user (e.g., 30-60 minutes) *before* the auction even begins, contingent on entering a designated geofence. The reservation is extended if the user actively participates in the auction.  If the user *wins* the auction, the reservation is confirmed.  If the user doesn’t participate or doesn’t win, the reservation expires and the item is released.
    *   Output: Reservation status (active, expired, confirmed), reservation timestamp.

**II. Workflow:**

1.  User views item listing. Selects “Request Code” rather than immediate purchase.
2.  System sends code to user.
3.  DRE initiates a *soft* reservation of the item, linked to the user’s account.
4.  System registers the user's location interest (based on the initial listing view or user-defined preferences) and assigns them to relevant geofences (e.g., stores carrying that item).
5.  When the user enters a pre-defined geofence, the system triggers an SMS notification: “Auction for [Item Name] starting now! Reply with your bid.” (Or within an app).
6.  User participates in the auction via SMS or app.
7.  If the user wins, the reservation is *confirmed* and the purchase is processed.
8.  If the user does not bid or loses the auction, the reservation expires after a set period (e.g., 15 minutes) and the item is made available again.

**III. Pseudocode (DRE core):**

```
function reserveItem(userID, itemID, deliveryRadius):
  reservation = createReservation(userID, itemID, timestamp + 60 minutes)
  setReservationStatus(reservation, "active")
  return reservation

function updateReservation(reservation, event):
  if event == "auction_participation":
    extendReservation(reservation, 30 minutes) //Extend if user bids
  if event == "auction_win":
    setReservationStatus(reservation, "confirmed")
    processPurchase(reservation)
  if event == "reservation_timeout":
    setReservationStatus(reservation, "expired")
    releaseItem(reservation)

function checkGeofence(userID, itemID):
  if userIsInGeofence(userID, itemID):
    sendAuctionNotification(userID, itemID)
    return True
  return False
```

**IV.  Additional Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:**  Must handle a large number of concurrent auctions and reservations.  Consider message queuing for asynchronous processing.
*   **Fraud Prevention:**  Implement mechanisms to prevent malicious bidding or reservation hoarding.
*   **User Privacy:**  Require explicit user consent for location tracking.
*   **Integration with Inventory Management:** Real-time inventory updates are critical.
*   **Dynamic Pricing:**  Adjust auction start prices based on inventory levels and demand.
