## Dynamic Skill-Based Scheduling with Real-Time Proficiency Adjustment

**Concept:** Expand upon the scheduling group concept by integrating a dynamic skill proficiency model. Instead of simply grouping agents with *shared* characteristics, this system continuously evaluates and adjusts agent skill levels *within* those groups, impacting shift assignment in real-time. This creates a fluid, optimized schedule that responds to both workload demands and individual agent performance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Proficiency Model:**

*   **Skill Taxonomy:** A hierarchical taxonomy of skills required for agent tasks (e.g., 'Customer Service' -> 'Complaint Resolution' -> 'Advanced Negotiation').
*   **Proficiency Metrics:**  Each agent is assigned a proficiency score for each skill in the taxonomy. This score is *not* static. It’s derived from:
    *   **Historical Performance Data:**  Call resolution rates, customer satisfaction scores, average handle time, error rates, etc.
    *   **Real-time Quality Monitoring:**  AI-powered analysis of agent interactions (speech/text) to assess skill application *during* calls.
    *   **Self-Assessment:** Agents periodically rate their own proficiency (subject to validation).
    *   **Peer Review:** (Optional) Agents assess each other’s skills in specific areas.
*   **Decay/Growth Factors:** Proficiency scores decay over time if skills aren’t actively used.  Performance on challenging tasks results in faster skill growth.

**2. Scheduling Algorithm:**

*   **Group Formation:** Initial scheduling groups are formed based on basic characteristics (as per the original patent).
*   **Skill-Weighted Assignment:**  Within each group, shift assignments are prioritized based on an agent’s skill proficiency *for the expected workload* of that shift.
    *   For example, if a shift is anticipated to be heavy with complex complaints, agents with high ‘Advanced Negotiation’ scores are favored.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   **Real-time Monitoring:** The system continuously monitors agent performance during shifts.
    *   **Performance-Based Re-Weighting:** Agents who consistently outperform expectations on specific tasks have their proficiency scores increased, boosting their prioritization for similar tasks in future shifts. Conversely, underperforming agents have their scores adjusted downwards.
    *   **Adaptive Grouping:** The system can *dynamically adjust* group boundaries based on skill drift.  Agents whose skills diverge significantly from their original group may be reassigned to a more appropriate group.
*   **Constraint Handling:** The algorithm must satisfy standard scheduling constraints (time off requests, maximum shift lengths, etc.).

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Data Sources:** CRM, call recording systems, quality monitoring tools, agent self-assessment portals.
*   **Processing Engine:** A machine learning model (e.g., a reinforcement learning agent) responsible for optimizing shift assignments.
*   **API Integrations:**  Connections to existing scheduling systems to deploy the optimized schedule.
*   **Dashboard:** A visualization tool for administrators to monitor schedule performance, agent skill levels, and system recommendations.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function assign_shifts(scheduling_group, available_shifts, agent_profiles):
    for each shift in available_shifts:
        best_agent = null
        best_score = -1
        for each agent in scheduling_group:
            skill_score = calculate_skill_score(agent, shift.workload)
            if skill_score > best_score:
                best_score = skill_score
                best_agent = agent
        assign shift to best_agent
        update_agent_profile(best_agent, shift) // Adjust skill scores based on performance
    return assigned_shifts
```

**Novelty:** This expands upon static grouping by introducing a dynamic, performance-driven element. It creates a "living" schedule that adapts to both workload changes and individual agent capabilities, maximizing efficiency and improving service quality. It moves beyond merely matching agents to tasks and towards actively *developing* agent skills through intelligent scheduling.
