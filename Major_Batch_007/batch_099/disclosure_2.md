## Dynamic Perceptual Mapping for Multi-Display Environments

**Specification:** A system for creating and applying dynamic perceptual mappings tailored to individual displays and viewing conditions within a multi-display environment.

**Core Concept:** The patent focuses on mapping between non-perceptual and perceptual quantizers. This builds on that, anticipating scenarios beyond single displays – think wall-sized video, or individual screens within a vehicle. Each display *will* have different characteristics. Rather than a static mapping, this system creates *individualized* mappings during runtime.

**System Components:**

1.  **Display Characterization Module:**
    *   Hardware: Spectroradiometer/Colorimeter, Light Sensor.
    *   Function:  Automatically profiles each connected display, capturing its color gamut, peak luminance, contrast ratio, viewing angle characteristics, and ambient lighting conditions. This generates a ‘display fingerprint’.
    *   Output:  A dynamic lookup table (LUT) representing the display’s transfer function, combined with metadata regarding ambient light levels.

2.  **Perceptual Model Engine:**
    *   Implementation:  Based on established perceptual models (e.g., CIECAM02, but adaptable to newer models).
    *   Function:  Takes the display fingerprint as input, and dynamically generates a customized perceptual mapping function (PMF).  The PMF defines the transformation between non-perceptual code values (e.g., 8-bit RGB) and perceptually uniform code values. This PMF accounts for the specific characteristics of *that* display and its environment.

3.  **Adaptive Quantization & Dithering Module:**
    *   Function:  Utilizes the PMF to quantize and dither incoming video frames. The quantization levels and dithering patterns are adjusted based on the perceptual mapping, ensuring optimal visual quality on that particular display.

4.  **Content Analysis Module:**
    *   Implementation:  AI-powered image analysis.
    *   Function: Analyzes each frame of video, identifying areas of high detail or rapid motion.
    *   Output: A ‘complexity map’ assigned to each frame, indicating regions requiring higher bitrates or more aggressive dithering.

5. **Communication Network:**
    *   Implementation: Wired/Wireless Protocol (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi, dedicated bus).
    *   Function: Facilitates communication between all system components, enabling real-time synchronization and data exchange.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
FOR each display IN connected_displays:
    display_fingerprint = Display_Characterization_Module.capture_profile(display)
    custom_pmf = Perceptual_Model_Engine.generate_mapping(display_fingerprint)
    store custom_pmf IN display_profile

FOR each frame IN video_stream:
    complexity_map = Content_Analysis_Module.analyze_frame(frame)

    FOR each pixel IN frame:
        pixel_value = frame[pixel]
        complexity_factor = complexity_map[pixel]
        display_profile = connected_displays[display_connected_to]

        perceptually_uniform_value = apply_perceptual_mapping(pixel_value, display_profile, complexity_factor)
        quantized_value = apply_adaptive_quantization(perceptually_uniform_value)
        dithered_value = apply_adaptive_dithering(quantized_value)
        output_frame[pixel] = dithered_value

    transmit output_frame to connected display
```

**Novelty & Potential:**

This system moves beyond static perceptual mappings to a dynamic, per-display solution. It recognizes that even identical displays in the same environment can vary slightly.  The combination of display characterization, perceptual modeling, and content analysis unlocks the potential for significantly improved visual quality, reduced bandwidth requirements, and a more immersive viewing experience, *especially* in complex multi-display setups. Imagine a vehicle dashboard, or a wall of synchronized screens – the differences in viewing angle, ambient light, and screen characteristics become critical.
