## Dynamic Skill-Based Label Augmentation & Predictive Personalization

**Concept:** Expand upon the label encoding approach to not only recognize intent but *predict* likely user needs based on a continuously evolving profile of demonstrated preferences and inferred goals. This goes beyond simple label association to build a personalized “skill graph” that proactively suggests relevant actions.

**Specs:**

**I. Skill Graph Construction Module:**

*   **Data Input:** Linguistic input (from speech or text), user action logs (e.g., app selections, button presses, purchases), contextual data (time of day, location, device type).
*   **Node Representation:** Each label/intent from the existing system serves as a base node. These are augmented with nodes representing *skills* – higher-level abstractions of user capabilities and interests. Skills are dynamically generated based on patterns in user behavior.
*   **Edge Weighting:** Edges between labels/intents and skills represent the strength of association. Weights are calculated using a combination of:
    *   **Co-occurrence frequency:** How often a label/intent is associated with a particular skill.
    *   **Temporal decay:**  Recent associations carry more weight than older ones.
    *   **Contextual relevance:** Adjust weights based on the current context (e.g., a “music” label is more strongly associated with a “relaxation” skill during evening hours).
*   **Graph Database:** Utilize a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to store and efficiently query the skill graph.

**II. Predictive Label Augmentation Engine:**

*   **Contextual Embedding:** Encode the current context (linguistic input + contextual data) into a vector representation.
*   **Graph Traversal:**  Using the contextual embedding as a starting point, traverse the skill graph to identify relevant skills and associated labels/intents.
*   **Probability Scoring:** Assign a probability score to each potential label/intent based on its proximity to the starting point in the graph and the strength of associated edges.
*   **Label Augmentation:** Augment the initial set of recognized labels/intents with those having a probability score above a certain threshold.

**III. Personalized Action Recommendation Module:**

*   **Skill-Specific Intent Scoring:** For each recognized skill, leverage a skill-specific intent scorer (as outlined in the patent).  These scorers are trained to prioritize intents relevant to that skill.
*   **Action Mapping:** Map recognized intents to potential actions (e.g., launching an app, playing music, setting a reminder).
*   **Recommendation Ranking:** Rank potential actions based on a combination of intent score, user preferences, and contextual relevance.
*   **Proactive Suggestions:** Present top-ranked actions to the user as proactive suggestions (e.g., through a smart assistant interface).

**Pseudocode – Predictive Label Augmentation:**

```
function augment_labels(linguistic_input, contextual_data):
  # 1. Encode context
  context_embedding = encode_context(linguistic_input, contextual_data)

  # 2. Traverse skill graph
  relevant_nodes = traverse_skill_graph(context_embedding) # Returns list of nodes (labels/intents)

  # 3. Calculate probabilities
  probabilities = calculate_probabilities(relevant_nodes) # Uses edge weights, temporal decay, etc.

  # 4. Filter and augment
  augmented_labels = filter_labels(probabilities, threshold) # Keep labels above threshold
  return augmented_labels
```

**Novelty:** This builds on the patent by introducing dynamic, user-specific skill graphs, proactively predicting needs, and presenting personalized actions.  It shifts from purely reactive label recognition to a predictive, assistive system. The emphasis is on continuous learning and adaptation to individual user behavior.
