## Acoustic Mapping with Swarm Robotics & Dynamic Mesh Generation

**Concept:** Expand the object detection system beyond a single aerial vehicle by deploying a swarm of micro-drones, each equipped with minimal acoustic sensors and limited processing power. Instead of calculating precise distances for individual objects, create a real-time, dynamic acoustic map of the environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Drone Swarm:** 20-50 micro-drones (approx. 100g each). Each drone equipped with:
    *   3 Microphones (arranged in a triangular configuration for basic directional audio)
    *   Basic IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for position tracking relative to the swarm
    *   Low-power processor (for minimal signal processing & communication)
    *   Short-range radio communication module (for swarm coordination)
*   **Base Station:** Central unit responsible for:
    *   Receiving processed acoustic data from the swarm
    *   Constructing the dynamic acoustic map
    *   Object identification & location
    *   Higher level control/tasking of the swarm
*   **Acoustic Emission:** Each drone generates a constant, unique, low-frequency tone (akin to sonar pings, but inaudible to humans in normal conditions). This allows for triangulation even without relying solely on reflected propeller noise. 
*   **Mesh Generation:** The base station uses the received acoustic signals and drone positions to build a voxel-based 3D mesh. Voxels represent the acoustic 'density' of the environment. High density indicates the presence of an object.
*   **Dynamic Mapping Algorithm:**
    1.  **Signal Acquisition:** Each drone transmits its unique tone and receives reflected signals (propeller noise, emitted tones from other drones, environmental sounds).
    2.  **Time-of-Flight Calculation:** Each drone calculates the approximate time-of-flight for received signals.
    3.  **Position Estimation:** Using time-of-flight and the drone’s position, estimate the location of the reflecting object.
    4.  **Data Transmission:** Transmit estimated object locations and signal strength to the base station.
    5.  **Mesh Update:** The base station receives data from all drones and updates the 3D mesh. Voxels are assigned values based on signal strength and drone density.
    6.  **Object Segmentation:** Apply clustering algorithms to identify distinct objects within the mesh.
    7.  **Object Tracking:** Continuously update object positions within the mesh to track their movement.
*   **Swarm Coordination Protocol:** A decentralized algorithm allowing drones to maintain a loose formation, avoid collisions, and dynamically adjust their positions to optimize acoustic coverage. Drones use proximity sensing (infrared or ultrasonic) to avoid direct collisions.
*   **Error Mitigation:** The system will use a Kalman filter to reduce errors and provide a robust estimation of the objects. The error will be modeled based on the number of drones nearby.

**Pseudocode (Base Station – Mesh Update):**

```
function updateMesh(droneDataList):
  for each droneData in droneDataList:
    for each reflection in droneData.reflections:
      estimatedPosition = calculatePosition(droneData.position, reflection.timeOfFlight)
      voxel = getVoxelAt(estimatedPosition)
      voxel.signalStrength += reflection.signalStrength
  
  applySmoothingFilter(mesh)
  
  segmentObjects(mesh)
  
  return mesh
```

**Potential Advantages:**

*   Enhanced object detection in complex environments (e.g., cluttered spaces, low visibility).
*   Real-time 3D mapping of the environment.
*   Increased robustness to noise and interference.
*   Scalability: adding more drones increases coverage and accuracy.
*   Potential for integration with other sensor modalities (e.g., visual cameras, LiDAR).
