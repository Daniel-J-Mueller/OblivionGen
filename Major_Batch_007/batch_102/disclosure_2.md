## Dynamic Focal Point Assist – Multi-Camera System

**Concept:** Expanding on the idea of aligning images between cameras, this system leverages multiple cameras (beyond just front/rear) and AI to dynamically identify and assist focusing on *moving* subjects. Instead of just aligning a static image, the system anticipates subject movement and guides the user to maintain focus, even when the subject is in motion.

**Hardware Specs:**

*   **Camera Array:** Minimum of three cameras.
    *   Front-facing (standard).
    *   Rear-facing (standard).
    *   Dedicated Depth Sensor (ToF or Structured Light) – positioned near the rear camera.
*   **Processor:** Dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) capable of real-time object detection and tracking.
*   **Haptic Feedback System:** High-precision haptic engine capable of nuanced directional vibrations.
*   **Display:** High refresh rate display (120Hz+) to minimize perceived lag in visual feedback.
*   **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** High-precision IMU to track device movement accurately.

**Software/Algorithm Specs:**

1.  **Object Detection & Tracking:**
    *   Utilize a real-time object detection model (e.g., YOLO, SSD) trained on a diverse dataset of common subjects (people, pets, objects).
    *   Implement a Kalman filter or similar tracking algorithm to predict subject movement.

2.  **Multi-Camera Data Fusion:**
    *   Fuse data from all three cameras. The depth sensor provides accurate distance information.
    *   Establish a 3D coordinate system representing the subject's position.

3.  **Focal Point Prediction:**
    *   Using the tracked subject data and IMU data, predict the subject's future position within the frame.
    *   Calculate the necessary device adjustments (pan, tilt, zoom) to maintain focus on the predicted focal point.

4.  **Haptic Guidance System:**
    *   **Directional Vibration:**  The haptic engine generates vibrations that *directionally* guide the user to move the device in the optimal direction.  The intensity of the vibration corresponds to the magnitude of the necessary adjustment. (Stronger vibration = larger adjustment).
    *   **Temporal Vibration Pattern:** The vibration pattern changes based on the speed of the subject’s movement. Faster movement = faster vibration frequency.
    *   **Virtual "Lock-On":** When the device is correctly aligned, a brief, distinct haptic "pulse" confirms a successful lock-on, enabling image capture.

5.  **Visual Feedback Overlay:**
    *   A subtle, semi-transparent visual overlay on the display indicates the predicted focal point. This overlay moves in real-time, guiding the user's eye.
    *   A color-coded indicator (e.g., green = locked on, yellow = aligning, red = out of focus) provides additional visual feedback.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Guidance Loop):**

```
while (cameraActive):
    subjectData = detectAndTrackSubject(cameraFrames);
    predictedPosition = predictSubjectPosition(subjectData, imuData);
    adjustmentVector = calculateAdjustmentVector(predictedPosition, currentCameraPosition);
    vibrationIntensity = abs(adjustmentVector);
    vibrationDirection = atan2(adjustmentVector.y, adjustmentVector.x); //Angle for directional haptics
    hapticEngine.setVibration(vibrationIntensity, vibrationDirection);

    if (isAligned(predictedPosition, currentCameraPosition, alignmentThreshold)):
        hapticEngine.pulse(); // Confirm lock-on
        // Capture image
    endif
endwhile
```

**Refinement Paths:**

*   **AI-Driven Scene Understanding:**  Integrate AI to understand the scene context and prioritize subjects (e.g., prioritize faces in a crowd).
*   **Adaptive Alignment:** Allow the user to customize the alignment sensitivity and behavior.
*   **AR Integration:**  Project augmented reality elements onto the scene to assist with framing and composition.
*    **Subject Anticipation:** Incorporate machine learning to *anticipate* subject movement *before* it occurs, providing smoother guidance.
