## Adaptive Write Barrier Granularity

**Specification:** Implement a storage device controller capable of dynamically adjusting the granularity of write barriers – not just at the command level, but *within* individual write commands.

**Rationale:** The provided patent focuses on grouping commands under a write barrier. This is useful, but inflexible. Consider scenarios where a single large write command needs specific ordering guarantees for *parts* of that data.  Current systems either enforce the barrier on the entire write or don't provide granularity at all.

**Components:**

*   **Write Command Descriptor:** Augment the standard data write command structure with a “Barrier Segmentation Map” (BSM). The BSM is a bitfield, with each bit corresponding to a fixed-size data block within the write command’s payload.  A set bit indicates that block is subject to the current write barrier.
*   **Dynamic Barrier Queue (DBQ):**  A dedicated queue within the storage device controller to manage granular barrier segments. This queue stores metadata about each segment: starting offset within the original command, size, and the associated write barrier ID.
*   **Data Reassembly Buffer (DRB):** A temporary buffer to hold barrier-segmented data until all segments associated with a barrier are processed.
*   **Barrier ID Registry:** A table to store write barrier identifiers and associated completion flags.

**Operation:**

1.  **Command Reception:** A data write command arrives with a BSM. The controller parses the BSM and identifies the data blocks subject to the current write barrier.
2.  **Segmentation & Enqueueing:** For each set bit in the BSM, the controller extracts the corresponding data block from the command, creates a DBQ entry containing the offset, size, write barrier ID, and enqueues it.
3.  **Out-of-Order Processing (Conditional):**  Data blocks *not* associated with the barrier can be processed immediately, enabling parallel operation.
4.  **Barrier Fulfillment:** The controller monitors the DBQ for completion of all segments associated with the current barrier ID.
5.  **Reassembly & Write:** Once all segments are processed, the controller reassembles the data blocks (using the stored offsets) and writes the complete data to the storage medium.
6.  **Barrier Completion Notification:** Sets the completion flag in the Barrier ID Registry.

**Pseudocode (Controller Logic):**

```
function process_write_command(command):
  bsm = command.barrier_segmentation_map
  barrier_id = command.barrier_id

  for i from 0 to length(bsm):
    if bsm[i] == 1:
      segment = extract_data_segment(command, i)
      create_dbq_entry(segment, i, barrier_id)
    else:
      process_data_segment_immediately(command, i)

  if dbq_is_empty(barrier_id):
    // All segments processed, no need for reassembly
    return

  // Wait for all segments to be processed from DBQ
  while dbq_not_empty(barrier_id):
      //handle concurrent writes
      pass
  
  reassembled_data = reassemble_data_from_dbq(barrier_id)
  write_data_to_storage(reassembled_data)
  mark_barrier_complete(barrier_id)

function reassemble_data_from_dbq(barrier_id):
    segments = get_segments_from_dbq(barrier_id)
    sorted_segments = sort_segments_by_offset(segments) //Ensure correct order
    reassembled_data = concatenate_data(sorted_segments)
    return reassembled_data
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Increased Parallelism:** Allows processing of non-barrier data while waiting for barrier segments, improving throughput.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** Enables precise ordering guarantees for specific data blocks within a write command.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Reduces latency by avoiding unnecessary blocking.
