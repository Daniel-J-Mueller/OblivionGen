## Adaptive Threat Modeling via Synthetic Log Generation

**Concept:** Expand threat correlation by proactively generating synthetic logs representing potential attack vectors *before* they manifest, allowing for pre-emptive threat modeling and improved anomaly detection. The existing patent focuses on *reacting* to correlated threats. This approach builds a 'synthetic adversary' to stress-test the system *before* an actual attack.

**Specifications:**

**1. Synthetic Log Generator Module:**

*   **Input:**  A library of attack templates (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK framework), configurable parameters (attack sophistication, target system profile, network topology), and current system baseline logs (from the existing patent's log collection).
*   **Process:**
    *   Select an attack template.
    *   Randomize/parameterize attack steps based on configuration.
    *   Generate a sequence of synthetic log entries mirroring the chosen attack, injecting them into a dedicated ‘simulation stream’.  These logs are tagged as ‘synthetic’ to differentiate them from real events.
    *   Vary injection rate to simulate low-and-slow attacks versus rapid exploits.
    *   Generate both application-level (operating system and above) and hypervisor-level logs.
*   **Output:**  A stream of synthetic log entries suitable for ingestion into the existing log correlation pipeline.

**2.  Hybrid Correlation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Real-time logs (from customer/provider resources), synthetic logs (from Synthetic Log Generator), existing threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Process:**
    *   Treat synthetic logs as ‘observed’ events.
    *   Apply the existing clustering algorithm to *both* real and synthetic logs.
    *   Prioritize correlations involving synthetic logs. This will effectively 'train' the system to recognize attacks in progress *before* they cause significant damage.
    *   Implement a 'confidence score' based on the number of synthetic logs involved in a correlation. Higher scores indicate a higher probability of a real attack.
    *   Maintain a dynamic ‘attack surface map’ based on the synthetic attack simulations. This map highlights the most vulnerable areas of the system.
*   **Output:**  Correlated threat information with confidence scores and a visual representation of the attack surface map.

**3. Adaptive Feedback Loop:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor the performance of the system based on simulated attacks (using synthetic logs).
    *   Identify ‘blind spots’ in the threat detection capabilities.
    *   Automatically generate new attack templates or refine existing ones to address the identified blind spots.
    *   Update the synthetic log generator with the refined attack templates.
*   **Output:** A continuously evolving library of attack templates and a more robust threat detection system.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Synthetic Log Generator
function generate_synthetic_logs(attack_template, parameters):
    synthetic_logs = []
    for step in attack_template:
        log_entry = create_log_entry(step, parameters)
        synthetic_logs.append(log_entry)
    return synthetic_logs

// Hybrid Correlation Engine
function correlate_logs(real_logs, synthetic_logs):
    all_logs = real_logs + synthetic_logs
    clusters = apply_clustering_algorithm(all_logs)
    threat_info = []
    for cluster in clusters:
        if any(log is synthetic for log in cluster):
            confidence_score = calculate_confidence_score(cluster)
            threat_info.append((cluster, confidence_score))
    return threat_info
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Sufficient processing power to handle the increased log volume from the synthetic log generator.
*   Scalable storage to accommodate the synthetic logs.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Integration with existing log management and correlation tools.
*   A flexible framework for creating and managing attack templates.
