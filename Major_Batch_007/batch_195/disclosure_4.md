## Autonomous Vehicle Swarm Mapping & Dynamic Obstacle Negotiation – “Honeycomb”

**Concept:** Expand indoor autonomous navigation beyond individual vehicle paths to a collaborative, real-time mapping and obstacle negotiation system dubbed “Honeycomb”. The system utilizes a swarm of low-cost, minimally equipped autonomous vehicles (“Drones”) to build and maintain a dynamic 3D map of the interior environment, then leverages this map for optimized, collaborative path planning, even in densely populated or rapidly changing environments.

**Hardware Specifications – Drone Units (x50-100 per facility):**

*   **Dimensions:** 20cm x 20cm x 10cm (optimized for navigating tight spaces)
*   **Locomotion:** Four-wheeled differential drive.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   Low-resolution Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor (range: 5m, FOV: 90 degrees) - primary mapping data.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – for localization assistance.
    *   Basic optical flow sensor – for collision avoidance & velocity estimation.
    *   Radio communication module (802.11ax) - mesh network connectivity.
*   **Processing:** Embedded ARM Cortex-A72 quad-core processor with 4GB RAM.
*   **Power:** 7.4V Lithium Polymer battery (4000mAh, ~60min runtime). Wireless charging capable.
*   **Payload:** None (strictly mapping/navigation focused).
*   **Cost Target:** <$200 per unit.

**Software Architecture – Central Server:**

*   **Mapping Module:**
    *   Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm –  modified for multi-vehicle input.  Utilizes a probabilistic occupancy grid map.
    *   Sensor fusion – integrates data from all active Drones.
    *   Dynamic map updating – constantly refines the map based on new data.
    *   Map compression & storage – efficient storage of large-scale 3D maps.
*   **Path Planning Module:**
    *   A* or RRT* algorithm - generates optimal paths for delivery vehicles *and* dynamically reroutes Drones to maintain map coverage.
    *   Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) -  collision avoidance and coordinated movement of delivery vehicles & Drones.
    *   Predictive modeling - anticipates pedestrian/obstacle movement to proactively adjust routes.
*   **Communication Module:**
    *   Mesh network protocol - reliable communication between Drones & Central Server.
    *   Drone management - monitoring Drone status, battery levels, and assigning tasks.
    *   API integration - interfaces with existing warehouse management systems (WMS) & delivery platforms.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

1.  **Initialization:** Deploy Drone swarm throughout facility. Drones begin autonomously exploring & mapping the environment.
2.  **Mapping Phase:**
    *   Each Drone continuously scans its surroundings using ToF sensor.
    *   Raw sensor data transmitted to Central Server.
    *   SLAM algorithm generates a 3D map of the environment.
    *   Map is continuously updated with new data from all Drones.
3.  **Delivery Request:** Receive delivery request (item, destination).
4.  **Path Planning:**
    *   Path Planning Module calculates optimal route for delivery vehicle, considering the current map, obstacles, and predicted pedestrian movement.
    *   Dynamic Drone rerouting – Drones move to maintain optimal map coverage and provide real-time obstacle data along the delivery route.
5.  **Delivery Execution:**
    *   Delivery vehicle follows the calculated route.
    *   Real-time obstacle avoidance – Delivery vehicle utilizes obstacle data from Drones to dynamically adjust its path.
    *   Drone swarm provides a “virtual safety bubble” around the delivery vehicle, proactively identifying and avoiding potential collisions.
6.  **Continuous Learning:**
    *   The system continuously learns from new data, improving map accuracy, path planning efficiency, and obstacle avoidance capabilities.

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Swarm-based mapping:**  Distributes mapping workload across a large number of low-cost Drones, enabling real-time, high-resolution mapping of large indoor spaces.
*   **Dynamic map coverage:** Drones actively reposition themselves to maintain optimal map coverage and provide real-time obstacle data.
*   **Virtual safety bubble:** Creates a proactive safety layer around delivery vehicles, reducing the risk of collisions.
*   **Scalability:** System can be easily scaled to accommodate larger facilities or increased delivery volume.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Warehouses
*   Hospitals
*   Shopping malls
*   Airports
*   Large office buildings
