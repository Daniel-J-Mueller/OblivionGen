## Biometric Lock Integration with Predictive Access

**System Overview:** This system expands upon the access control framework by integrating biometric authentication *and* predictive access based on user behavioral patterns. It aims to provide seamless, secure, and proactive access to structures.

**Core Components:**

*   **Biometric Scanner:** High-resolution facial/iris/fingerprint scanner integrated into the structure entrance (doorbell camera, door handle, etc.).
*   **Behavioral Analysis Engine (BAE):** Cloud-based AI engine that analyzes user activity data (time of day, location data from authorized devices, calendar appointments, historical access logs).
*   **Predictive Access Module (PAM):**  A component within the BAE that uses machine learning algorithms to predict a user's need to access the structure.
*   **Secure Communication Channel:** Encrypted communication between the biometric scanner, BAE, PAM, and smart lock.
*   **User Management System:** Cloud-based interface for authorized users to manage access permissions, biometric data, and behavioral preferences.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **User Enrollment:** The first user enrolls second users by associating their biometric data (facial scan, iris scan, etc.) with the system via the User Management System. User behavioral preferences can be configured (e.g., “automatically unlock door between 8 AM and 9 AM if I'm within 100 meters”).
2.  **Approach Detection:** As a user approaches the structure, the biometric scanner activates and attempts to identify the user.
3.  **Biometric Authentication:** If a potential match is found, the system initiates biometric authentication. If authentication succeeds, proceed to step 4. If it fails, a standard access method (PIN, temporary code) is requested.
4.  **Predictive Access Check:** Simultaneously with biometric authentication, the PAM checks if the user’s predicted access need aligns with their current location, time of day, and calendar events.
5.  **Automated Unlocking:** If both biometric authentication *and* the predictive access check succeed, the smart lock automatically unlocks the entrance. A notification is sent to the first user (optional).
6.  **Access Log:** All access events (successful and failed) are logged with timestamps, user identification, and authentication methods used.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Access Module):**

```
function predict_access_need(user_id, current_time, current_location, calendar_events, historical_access_logs):
  // Fetch user's historical access patterns
  historical_data = get_historical_access_logs(user_id)

  // Analyze calendar events for scheduled activities near the structure
  upcoming_events = filter_events_by_location_and_time(calendar_events, current_location, current_time)

  // Calculate a "need score" based on historical data, calendar events, and proximity
  need_score = calculate_need_score(historical_data, upcoming_events, current_location)

  // Compare need score to a threshold
  if need_score > threshold:
    return True  // Predict user needs access
  else:
    return False // No strong indication of access need
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Biometric Scanner:** Minimum resolution: 1080p, Accuracy: <0.1% False Acceptance Rate, Secure Element for biometric data storage.
*   **Communication Protocol:** TLS 1.3 encryption, secure API endpoints.
*   **Data Storage:** HIPAA/GDPR compliant cloud storage, data encryption at rest and in transit.
*   **Power Requirements:** Smart lock and scanner: battery backup and/or hardwired power.
*   **User Interface:** Web and mobile application for user management, access control, and event logging.
*   **Scalability:** System must support a large number of users and structures.
*   **Integration:** Open API for integration with other smart home systems.
