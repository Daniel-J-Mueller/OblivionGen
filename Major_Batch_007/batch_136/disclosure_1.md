## Adaptive Multi-Stream Prioritization & Dynamic Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the edge-based prediction and resource configuration to a system that dynamically prioritizes *multiple* concurrent data streams from numerous edge devices, adapting resources not just for bandwidth, but for compute *and* storage within the provider network. This moves beyond simply prepping for *a* stream, and into orchestrating an ecosystem of streams with shifting priorities.

**Specs:**

**1. Edge Device Enhancement – ‘Stream Profile’ Generation:**

*   Each edge device (camera, microphone array, sensor network) will generate a ‘Stream Profile’.  This isn’t just metadata about the stream (resolution, framerate), but a predictive analysis of *content complexity*.
*   Content complexity is quantified via:
    *   **Motion Vector Density:** (For video) A measure of pixel displacement between frames. High density = high complexity.
    *   **Acoustic Event Density:** (For audio) Number of distinct sound events detected (speech, alarms, etc.).
    *   **Object Count & Classification:** (Computer Vision) Number and type of identified objects within the frame.
*   The Stream Profile is updated continuously and transmitted to the provider network alongside (or embedded within) initial stream metadata.
*   Pseudocode (Edge Device):
    ```
    loop:
        data = capture_data()
        complexity = analyze_complexity(data)
        stream_profile = create_stream_profile(complexity)
        transmit(stream_profile)
        transmit(data)
    ```

**2. Provider Network – Dynamic Priority Engine (DPE):**

*   The DPE receives Stream Profiles from all connected edge devices.
*   It employs a weighted scoring system to assign each stream a *Dynamic Priority Score (DPS)*.  Weights are configurable and can be adjusted based on client SLAs, event-driven rules, or AI-driven learning.
*   DPS Calculation:
    `DPS = (Content Complexity Weight * Content Complexity Score) + (Client SLA Weight * Client SLA Priority) + (Event Trigger Weight * Event Trigger Score)`
*   The DPE continuously monitors DPS across all streams.

**3. Resource Allocation Manager (RAM):**

*   The RAM manages compute, bandwidth, and storage resources within the provider network.
*   It receives DPS information from the DPE.
*   RAM Allocation Logic:
    *   Streams with highest DPS receive priority access to resources.
    *   Resources are allocated dynamically based on *predicted* demand (based on DPS trends, not just current load).
    *   Lower priority streams are subject to controlled degradation (reduced resolution, framerate, or data compression) to free up resources for higher priority streams.
    *   RAM employs ‘Resource Reservations’ – pre-allocating resources for critical streams based on historical DPS data.

**4.  ‘Shadow Streaming’ & Predictive Pre-Processing:**

*   For streams with exceptionally high and *predictable* DPS (e.g., live sporting events), the RAM initiates ‘Shadow Streaming’.
*   Shadow Streaming involves proactively pre-processing the incoming data stream (encoding, transcoding, analysis) on dedicated hardware *before* the event officially begins.
*   This reduces latency and ensures immediate availability of processed data when the event is live.

**5.  API & Orchestration:**

*   Provide a comprehensive API allowing clients to:
    *   Define custom weighting factors for DPS calculation.
    *   Set event triggers (e.g., “increase priority for streams near a specific geo-fence”).
    *   Monitor resource allocation and stream performance.
*   Orchestration layer to automatically scale resources based on predicted demand, and adaptively re-allocate resources during peak events.



This moves beyond simple resource *configuration* to active, predictive *orchestration* of a network of data streams, prioritizing content based on a dynamic analysis of its complexity and importance.
