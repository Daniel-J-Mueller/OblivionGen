## Adaptive Storage Granularity & Predictive Tiering

**Specification:** Implement a system where storage granularity isn't fixed, and tiering is predicted *before* data is fully written. This builds on the concept of performing operations within the storage service, avoiding data export, but introduces a proactive, dynamic storage model.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of assigning data to a fixed storage tier based on initial characteristics, the system *predicts* future access patterns during the write process. This allows for initial storage in a potentially lower-cost tier, with proactive migration *before* performance degradation occurs.  Granularity adapts based on access prediction and object size. Small, infrequently accessed objects coalesce into larger, compressed containers. Frequently accessed, small objects remain granular. 

**Components:**

*   **Prediction Engine:** An ML model trained on historical access patterns, object metadata (type, size, creation time), and user behavior.  Takes incoming write requests as input.
*   **Dynamic Granularity Manager:** Responsible for splitting or merging objects based on size and access prediction.
*   **Tiered Storage Abstraction Layer:**  Manages access to different storage tiers (SSD, NVMe, HDD, Tape, etc.).
*   **Write Interceptor:**  Intercepts write requests *before* data is fully stored.
*   **Background Coalescer/Splitter:**  Asynchronously merges small, infrequently accessed objects or splits large, frequently accessed objects.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Write Request Interception:** The Write Interceptor receives a data object and associated metadata.
2.  **Prediction:** The Prediction Engine analyzes the metadata and historical data to predict future access frequency, latency requirements, and data lifecycle.
3.  **Granularity Determination:** Based on prediction, the Dynamic Granularity Manager determines the optimal storage granularity. Small, infrequent = coalesce. Large, frequent = split.
4.  **Tier Assignment:** The Prediction Engine assigns an initial storage tier.  Low initial cost if prediction indicates infrequent access.
5.  **Write Operation:** Data is written to the assigned tier and granularity.
6.  **Background Optimization:** The Background Coalescer/Splitter continuously monitors access patterns. If predictions are inaccurate, it adjusts granularity and migrates data to a more appropriate tier *before* performance impact.

**Pseudocode (Background Coalescer/Splitter):**

```
FUNCTION OptimizeStorage(dataObject, accessLog)
  IF accessLog.frequency(dataObject) < threshold_infrequent AND dataObject.size < threshold_small
    // Coalesce with nearby infrequently accessed objects
    nearbyObjects = FindNearbyInfrequentObjects(dataObject)
    mergedObject = MergeObjects(dataObject, nearbyObjects)
    Compress(mergedObject)
    MoveToTier(mergedObject, low_cost_tier)
  ELSE IF accessLog.frequency(dataObject) > threshold_frequent AND dataObject.size > threshold_large
    // Split into smaller objects
    splitObjects = SplitObject(dataObject)
    MoveToTier(splitObjects, high_performance_tier)
  END IF
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **AccessLog:**  Timestamped records of data object access.
*   **PredictionModel:** ML model trained on AccessLog and metadata.
*   **TieredStorageMap:** Maps storage tiers to physical storage locations and cost.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced storage costs by intelligently tiering data.
*   Improved performance by proactively migrating frequently accessed data.
*   Automatic optimization of storage granularity.
*   Scalable and adaptable to changing access patterns.
