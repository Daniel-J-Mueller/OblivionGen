## Dynamic Error Context Propagation with Hierarchical AER

**Concept:** Extend the Advanced Error Reporting (AER) capability by creating a hierarchical error context propagation system, layering error information beyond simple attributes and identifiers. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of error origins and dependencies, enabling proactive fault isolation and recovery, especially in complex, multi-function systems.

**Specs:**

*   **Error Context Objects (ECOs):** Introduce a data structure, the ECO, to encapsulate error information.  An ECO includes:
    *   `error_code`: Standard AER error code.
    *   `function_id`: Identifier of the function associated with the error.
    *   `context_id`: Unique identifier for *this specific instance* of an error within the function.  Allows for tracking multiple concurrent errors.
    *   `dependency_list`: A list of `context_id`s representing other ECOs that *contributed* to this error.  This is the core of the hierarchy.
    *   `severity`:  Error severity level (critical, major, minor, informational).
    *   `timestamp`:  Error occurrence time.
    *   `data_payload`: Variable-length data related to the error, allowing for system-specific diagnostics.

*   **Emulated Configuration Registers (ECRs) for ECO Storage:**  Extend the ECR space with dedicated registers for managing ECOs.
    *   `ECO_Base_Address`:  Base address in memory where ECOs are stored.
    *   `ECO_Count`:  Number of ECOs currently stored.
    *   `ECO_Pool_Size`:  Maximum number of ECOs that can be stored.
    *   `ECO_Write_Pointer`:  Pointer to the next available slot for writing a new ECO.
    *   `ECO_Read_Pointer`:  Pointer to the next ECO to be read.

*   **Hardware/Software Co-operation for ECO Population:**
    1.  Upon detecting an error, the hardware generates an interrupt *and* attempts to populate a minimal ECO (at least `error_code`, `function_id`, and `context_id`).
    2.  The interrupt handler (in software) retrieves this minimal ECO.
    3.  The handler then analyzes the error and, if it determines the error is caused by another function or another instance of the *same* function, it looks up the relevant `context_id` and adds it to the `dependency_list`.
    4.  The fully populated ECO is written to the memory location pointed to by `ECO_Write_Pointer`.  `ECO_Write_Pointer` is incremented.

*   **Host-Side ECO Traversal:**  The host software can read the ECOs from memory and traverse the `dependency_list` to understand the errorâ€™s root cause. A dedicated driver or utility can visualize this error hierarchy.

*   **Error Propagation Protocol:** A new TLP message type: `ErrorContextReport`. This message allows the device to proactively push ECOs to the host, even without a direct host request. This enables proactive fault detection and analysis.  The message format includes:
    *   `ECO_Count`: Number of ECOs in the report.
    *   `ECO_Data`:  An array of ECO data.

**Pseudocode (Device - Interrupt Handler):**

```
on_interrupt():
  error_code = hardware_get_error_code()
  function_id = hardware_get_function_id()
  context_id = generate_unique_context_id()

  eco = new ErrorContextObject(error_code, function_id, context_id)

  // Analyze error and identify dependencies
  if (error_caused_by_function(function_id, other_function_id)):
    dependent_context_id = get_context_id_for_function(other_function_id)
    eco.add_dependency(dependent_context_id)

  // Write ECO to memory
  memory_write(ECO_Base_Address + ECO_Write_Pointer, eco)
  ECO_Write_Pointer = (ECO_Write_Pointer + sizeof(ErrorContextObject)) % ECO_Pool_Size

  // Optionally, send ErrorContextReport TLP
  send_tlp(ErrorContextReport, eco)
```

**Innovation:**  This goes beyond simple error identification to create a *dynamic, traceable* error context.  It allows for a systemic understanding of failures, moving from reactive debugging to proactive fault management and potentially automated recovery.  The hierarchical dependency list is the key innovation, enabling complex error scenarios to be understood in a structured way.
