## Adaptive Proactive Assistance – “Ghost Agent”

**Concept:** Extend the agent availability/status system to *proactively* offer assistance based on user behavior *before* the user explicitly requests it, utilizing a “Ghost Agent” – a simulated agent presence offering help options.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Monitoring Module:**

*   **Input:** User interface event stream (clicks, scrolls, form inputs, dwell time on elements, error messages encountered).
*   **Processing:** Real-time analysis of UI events. Pre-trained machine learning models (specifically, sequence models like LSTMs or Transformers) to identify patterns indicative of user struggle or potential need for assistance.
*   **Output:**  "Assistance Score" (0-100) representing the likelihood the user requires help. Triggers based on score thresholds.  Categorization of assistance needed (e.g., “form completion,” “feature discovery,” “error resolution”).

**2. “Ghost Agent” Interface Component:**

*   **Display:** A subtle, non-intrusive UI element (e.g., a small animated icon, a collapsible bar) that appears only when the Assistance Score exceeds a defined threshold.  Avoids mimicking a *real* agent’s presence - more akin to contextual help.
*   **Functionality:** Presents a limited set of pre-defined assistance options. Examples:
    *   “Need help with this form?” (opens in-page guidance).
    *   “Discover more features” (highlights relevant UI elements).
    *   “Report a problem” (directs to feedback form).
*   **Adaptation:** Options dynamically adjust based on the identified Assistance Category.

**3. Contact Service Integration:**

*   **Agent Status Awareness:** The system still utilizes the existing agent status feed.
*   **Escalation Protocol:** If a user interacts with the “Ghost Agent” *and* the Assistance Score remains high, seamlessly escalate to a live agent connection.  Pass the user’s interaction history with the Ghost Agent to the live agent.
*   **Agent Prioritization:**  Users interacting with the Ghost Agent should be prioritized in the agent queue.

**4. Backend Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Event Loop
while (true) {
  event = receive_UI_Event()
  assistance_category = analyze_event(event)
  assistance_score = calculate_score(assistance_category)

  if (assistance_score > threshold) {
    display_ghost_agent(assistance_category)
  }

  if (user_interacts_with_ghost_agent() AND assistance_score > escalation_threshold) {
    escalate_to_live_agent(user, assistance_history)
  }
}
```

**5. Data Collection & Model Training:**

*   Log all UI events, Assistance Scores, Ghost Agent interactions, and escalation outcomes.
*   Use this data to continuously retrain the machine learning models, improving their accuracy in predicting user needs.
*   A/B test different Ghost Agent UI designs and assistance options to optimize user engagement.
