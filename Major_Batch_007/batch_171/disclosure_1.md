## Adaptive Sensory Substitution for Narrative Immersion

**Core Concept:** Extend spoiler protection beyond text/visuals to *all* sensory input. Not just suppressing content, but *substituting* it with analogous, non-spoilerous information. The system learns user preferences for analog substitution, building a personalized 'sensory firewall'.

**Specs:**

1.  **Multimodal Input Analysis:** System ingests data streams from user device: audio (microphone), video (camera), text (input, displayed content), potentially haptic data (wearables).
2.  **Content Fingerprinting:** Utilizes a combination of NLP, image/audio recognition, and data hashing to create a 'fingerprint' of incoming content. This fingerprint is compared against a database of spoiler data. This component is enhanced to recognize *analogous* elements. For example, a specific musical cue in a film associated with a plot twist.
3.  **Analog Substitution Database:** This is the core innovation. A database maps spoiler elements to acceptable substitutes. Examples:
    *   A visual spoiler (character death) -> Replaced with a blurred or stylized rendering.
    *   An audio spoiler (key dialogue line) -> Replaced with ambient sound or a non-relevant voice acting performance.
    *   Haptic spoiler (impact of a significant event) -> Replaced with a different haptic pattern.
    *   *Crucially*: Substitutions are not just 'removal' but replacement.
4.  **User Preference Learning:**
    *   Implicit Learning: Tracks user reactions to substitutions (e.g., did they attempt to override the substitution? How long did they tolerate it?).
    *   Explicit Learning: Allows users to rate or customize substitution preferences (e.g., "I prefer ambient sound to stylized visuals for audio substitutions").
    *   Preference profiles are stored and applied across different content platforms.
5.  **Real-Time Substitution Engine:** Based on fingerprint analysis and user preferences, the engine intercepts and replaces spoiler elements in real-time *before* they reach the user’s senses. 
6.  **Contextual Awareness:** System considers the user’s current activity (e.g., browsing a forum, watching a video, playing a game) to adjust sensitivity and substitution strategies.  Higher sensitivity during critical story moments.
7.  **API for Content Creators:**  An API allows content creators to *tag* elements in their content as potential spoilers, providing the system with more accurate information.

**Pseudocode (Substitution Engine):**

```
FUNCTION ProcessInput(inputData, contextData):
    fingerprint = GenerateFingerprint(inputData)
    spoilerMatch = CheckSpoilerDatabase(fingerprint)

    IF spoilerMatch:
        userPreference = GetUserPreference(spoilerMatch.category) // e.g., visual, audio
        substitutionData = GetSubstitution(spoilerMatch.category, userPreference)
        substitutedData = ApplySubstitution(inputData, substitutionData)
        RETURN substitutedData
    ELSE:
        RETURN inputData
```

**Example Scenario:** User is watching a movie. The system detects a visual spoiler (the villain's reveal). Based on the user's preference (stylized rendering), the villain is replaced with a blurred, abstract representation. The user sees *something* is there, but not the revealing details.

**Novelty:** This extends spoiler protection beyond simple suppression to *sensory substitution*. It creates a dynamic 'sensory firewall' that adapts to user preferences and maintains immersion without revealing critical plot details. The focus is not on *blocking* content, but *transforming* it.
