## Adaptive Multi-Sensory Notification System

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A networked “Sensory Hub” – a central processing unit capable of receiving data from multiple input sources and controlling multiple output devices.
*   **Input Sources:**
    *   Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine (similar to patent’s input)
    *   Environmental Sensors: Microphone array (ambient sound analysis), Camera (visual scene analysis), Temperature/Humidity/Air Quality sensors.
    *   Biometric Sensors (optional): Heart rate, skin conductance (via wearable integration).
    *   Networked Data Feeds: Calendar, News, Social Media.
*   **Output Devices:**
    *   Audio System: Spatial audio capable speakers.
    *   Visual Display: High-resolution, dynamically adjustable display (brightness, color temperature).
    *   Haptic Feedback System: Array of localized vibration actuators (integrated into furniture, wearables).
    *   Environmental Control System: Smart lighting, temperature control, aromatherapy diffusion.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Secure, low-latency wireless communication (Wi-Fi 6E, UWB) between Sensory Hub and peripheral devices.

**Functional Description:**

The system learns user preferences and contextual awareness to deliver notifications beyond simple audio/visual alerts. It aims to create subtle, multi-sensory “nudges” that are informative without being disruptive.

1.  **Contextual Analysis:** The Sensory Hub continuously analyzes data from all input sources to build a rich understanding of the user’s environment, activity, and emotional state.
2.  **Notification Prioritization & Fusion:** Incoming notifications (from apps, calendar, data feeds) are prioritized based on urgency, relevance, and user-defined rules. Multiple related notifications are *fused* into a single, unified sensory experience.
3.  **Sensory Mapping:** Based on the context and notification content, the system dynamically maps information to appropriate sensory channels. This isn't just about choosing *what* to notify, but *how* to notify.

    *   **Example 1 (Low-Priority Calendar Event):** Gentle shift in ambient lighting color (warm hue) combined with a subtle floral scent diffused into the air. No audio or visual alerts.
    *   **Example 2 (Urgent Work Email):** A localized vibration pattern on the user's chair, combined with a brief spoken summary of the email subject, delivered via spatial audio (sound appears to originate from the direction of the sender if known).
    *   **Example 3 (News Alert – Positive Story):** A brief burst of uplifting music, combined with a visually appealing animation displayed on a nearby screen.
    *    **Example 4 (Home Security Alert):** Bright red flashing lights, a loud alarm, and a notification sent to connected devices.
4.  **Adaptive Learning:** The system learns user preferences over time. It tracks which sensory combinations are most effective at capturing attention and minimizing disruption. User feedback (explicit ratings, implicit behavior) is used to refine the sensory mapping algorithm.

**Pseudocode (Sensory Mapping Engine):**

```
function mapNotificationToSensoryOutput(notification, contextData, userPreferences) {

  // Determine notification priority & type
  priority = determinePriority(notification)
  type = determineType(notification)

  //Analyze context
  activity = contextData.activity
  environment = contextData.environment
  emotionalState = contextData.emotionalState

  //Select base sensory profile based on priority & context
  if (priority == "high" && activity == "focused") {
    sensoryProfile = "urgent-discreet" //Vibration, spatial audio
  } else if (priority == "low" && environment == "relaxed") {
    sensoryProfile = "ambient-subtle" //Lighting, scent
  } else {
    sensoryProfile = "default" //Visual, audio
  }

  //Modify sensory profile based on notification type
  if (type == "calendar") {
    addSensoryCue("gentle-lighting-shift")
  } else if (type == "email") {
    addSensoryCue("spatial-audio-summary")
  }

  //Apply user preferences (learned over time)
  if (userPreferences.prefersScent) {
    addSensoryCue("aroma-diffusion")
  }

  //Combine sensory cues into output signals
  outputSignals = combineCues(sensoryProfile, outputCues)
  return outputSignals
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with Augmented Reality (AR) devices for context-aware visual overlays.
*   Biometric feedback loops to dynamically adjust sensory output based on user’s physiological response.
*   Personalized “sensory themes” to match user’s mood or aesthetic preferences.
*   Use of haptic textures to encode data into a tactile notification system.
