## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Mapping for Media

**Concept:** Extend the search and abridgement system to incorporate real-time emotional analysis of both the media content *and* the user’s responses, creating a dynamically adjusted media experience. This moves beyond simple interest in clips to understanding *how* a user is responding emotionally, and tailoring content accordingly.

**Specs:**

*   **Emotional Analysis Engine:** A module employing multimodal input - facial expression (via webcam), voice inflection (via microphone), and physiological data (via wearable sensors – heart rate, skin conductance). This engine will assess user emotional state (valence – positive/negative, arousal – high/low, dominance – feeling in control/submissive).
*   **Media Emotional Tagging:** All media content will be pre-processed and tagged with emotional arcs. This goes beyond simple sentiment analysis. We’re looking for “emotional beats” – moments of rising tension, catharsis, joy, sadness, etc. – and their intensity/duration. This will be expressed as a time-series emotional profile for each clip.
*   **Resonance Algorithm:** This core component will compare the user's real-time emotional profile to the emotional profile of the media clip. The goal is to maximize “emotional resonance” – alignment between user and content.
*   **Dynamic Abridgement Engine:**  Unlike the existing abridgement which focuses on identified "interesting" clips, this engine will dynamically assemble an abridgement *during playback*. 
    *   If the user shows positive resonance with a clip, the engine will seek out similar clips (based on emotional profile) and seamlessly transition between them.
    *   If the user shows negative resonance, the engine will either:
        *   Quickly transition to a clip with a contrasting emotional profile (e.g., from sadness to humor).
        *   Introduce "emotional buffer" clips – short, neutral segments designed to reset the user’s emotional state.
*   **Personalized Emotional Profile:** The system will learn each user's emotional preferences over time.  What emotional arcs do they respond to most strongly? What types of emotional transitions do they prefer? This data will be used to refine the Resonance Algorithm and further personalize the experience.
*   **Adaptive Difficulty:** For narrative content, the engine will adapt the "emotional difficulty" of the experience. If the user is consistently showing strong resonance, the engine will introduce more complex or challenging emotional arcs. If the user is struggling, the engine will simplify the experience.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Resonance Algorithm):**

```
function calculate_resonance(user_emotional_profile, clip_emotional_profile):
  // Calculate similarity between user and clip emotional profiles
  similarity_score = cosine_similarity(user_emotional_profile, clip_emotional_profile)

  // Adjust score based on user preferences
  preference_weight = user.emotional_preference_weight //Learned over time

  resonance_score = similarity_score * preference_weight

  return resonance_score
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Webcam
*   Microphone
*   Optional: Wearable physiological sensors (heart rate monitor, skin conductance sensor)

**Software Requirements:**

*   Real-time emotional analysis engine (machine learning model)
*   Media processing library (for seamless transitions)
*   User preference database
*   Communication protocols between hardware and software.
