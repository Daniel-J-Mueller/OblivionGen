## Temporal Graph Embeddings with Drift Correction

**Concept:** Extend the temporal ensemble concept by representing user-item interactions as a time-evolving graph, then learn embeddings for nodes (users & items) that *drift* predictably based on their interaction history and broader network trends. This addresses the problem of concept drift – evolving user preferences and item popularity – in a more nuanced way than simply retraining models on sliding windows.

**Specs:**

**1. Graph Construction:**

*   **Nodes:** Users & Items.
*   **Edges:** Represent interactions (purchases, clicks, ratings) weighted by recency. Recent interactions have higher weight.
*   **Time Slicing:** Divide the entire interaction history into discrete time slices (e.g., weekly). Each slice is a layer in the time-evolving graph.
*   **Layer Connectivity:**  Nodes exist across multiple layers. Edges are re-evaluated and potentially added/removed in each layer based on interactions within that time slice.
*   **Node Persistence:** Nodes (users/items) are maintained across all time slices unless explicitly removed (e.g., inactive user/discontinued item).

**2. Embedding Generation:**

*   **Model:** Utilize a Graph Neural Network (GNN) – specifically a Temporal Graph Network (TGN) – to learn node embeddings.  TGNs are designed to handle time-evolving graphs.
*   **Embedding Drift:** Implement a ‘drift’ component within the embedding update process. This drift component is calculated as a weighted average of:
    *   **Personal History Drift:** The change in embedding between the previous time slice.  Captures individual user/item preference evolution.
    *   **Network Trend Drift:** The average embedding change of *neighboring* nodes in the current time slice.  Captures broader trend shifts in the network.
*   **Loss Function:** Combine a standard link prediction loss (predicting interactions) with a regularization term that encourages smooth embedding evolution (minimizes the magnitude of embedding changes between time slices).
*   **Ensemble Integration:** Train multiple TGNs, each initialized with different random seeds and hyperparameters. The final recommendation is generated by averaging the predictions from all ensemble members.

**3. Recommendation Generation:**

*   **User-Item Similarity:** Calculate the similarity between user and item embeddings using a cosine similarity metric.
*   **Ranking:** Rank items based on their similarity scores.
*   **Filtering:** Apply business rules and constraints (e.g., inventory availability, user preferences) to refine the ranking.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each time slice 't'
FOR t IN time_slices:

    // Construct graph G_t based on interactions in time slice 't'
    G_t = ConstructGraph(interactions_t)

    // For each node 'n' in G_t
    FOR n IN G_t.nodes:

        // Calculate personal history drift
        IF t > 0:
            personal_drift = embedding(n, t-1) - embedding(n, t-2)
        ELSE:
            personal_drift = 0

        // Calculate network trend drift
        neighbor_embeddings = [embedding(neighbor) FOR neighbor IN G_t.neighbors(n)]
        network_drift = AVERAGE(neighbor_embeddings) - embedding(n)

        // Update embedding with drift correction
        embedding(n, t) = embedding(n, t-1) + learning_rate * (personal_drift + network_drift)

    // Generate recommendations for each user
    FOR user IN users:

        // Calculate similarity between user embedding and item embeddings
        similarities = [COSINE_SIMILARITY(user_embedding, item_embedding) FOR item IN items]

        // Rank items based on similarity
        ranked_items = SORT(items, similarities, descending=True)

        // Return top N ranked items
        recommendations = ranked_items[:N]
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   **GNN Framework:** PyTorch Geometric, DGL, or TensorFlow GNN.
*   **GPU Acceleration:** Essential for training and inference with large graphs.
*   **Distributed Training:**  For extremely large datasets, consider distributed training across multiple GPUs or machines.
*   **Graph Database:** Consider using a graph database (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) for efficient graph storage and querying.
