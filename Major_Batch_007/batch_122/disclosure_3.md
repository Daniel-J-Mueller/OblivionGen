## Dynamic Payment Token Ecosystem with Biometric & Behavioral Authentication

**Core Concept:** Expand the one-time use payment token system into a dynamic ecosystem where token validity isn't solely time-based but adapts based on ongoing biometric and behavioral authentication of the user.  This creates a 'living' token – constantly verifying the user throughout the transaction lifecycle.

**System Specifications:**

**1. User Device Component (Mobile App):**

*   **Multi-Factor Biometric Capture:** Integrate continuous biometric capture (fingerprint, facial recognition, voice analysis) during transaction initiation and completion.  This isn't a one-time check, but a rolling authentication factor.
*   **Behavioral Profiling Engine:** Track user interaction patterns (typing speed, swipe gestures, app usage frequency) to build a behavioral profile. Deviations from this profile trigger increased security checks.
*   **Token Lifecycle Management:** Handles token request, image code generation (as in the original patent), and transmission of biometric/behavioral data to the host.
*   **Dynamic Image Code:**  The image code isn't static. It incorporates a 'liveness' indicator derived from the biometric stream – subtly changing visuals based on real-time biometric confirmation.
*   **Secure Element/TEE Integration:** Leverage a secure element or Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to protect biometric data and cryptographic keys.
*   **Token Revocation Control:** User-initiated immediate token revocation.

**2. Host System (Server-Side):**

*   **Biometric/Behavioral Data Fusion Engine:**  Receive and fuse biometric/behavioral data from the user device. Apply machine learning algorithms to identify anomalies and assess risk.
*   **Dynamic Risk Scoring:**  Assign a dynamic risk score to each transaction based on fused biometric/behavioral data, transaction amount, merchant reputation, and other factors.
*   **Adaptive Token Validation:**  Token validation isn't all-or-nothing. Based on the dynamic risk score, the system can:
    *   **High Risk:** Require additional authentication factors (e.g., SMS OTP, security questions).
    *   **Medium Risk:**  Accept the token with increased monitoring.
    *   **Low Risk:**  Approve the transaction immediately.
*   **Token ‘Health’ Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the ‘health’ of the token based on ongoing biometric confirmation. If biometric confirmation fails or is inconsistent, the token is automatically invalidated.
*   **Fraud Detection Engine:**  Integrate with a fraud detection engine to identify and flag suspicious transactions.
*   **Secure Token Storage:** Store tokens securely using encryption and access control mechanisms.
*   **API Endpoints:** Provide API endpoints for token request, validation, and revocation.

**3. Recipient Device Component (POS Terminal/Mobile App):**

*   **Image Code Capture:** Capture the dynamic image code using a camera.
*   **Liveness Detection:**  Implement basic liveness detection to ensure the image code is being presented by a live person (not a replay attack).
*   **Data Transmission:** Transmit the image code, biometric data (if captured during image code capture), and transaction details to the host.

**Pseudocode (Host System - Token Validation):**

```
function validateToken(tokenId, transactionAmount, recipientId, imageCodeData, biometricData) {
    token = getToken(tokenId);

    if (token == null) {
        return "Invalid Token";
    }

    if (token.expirationTime < currentTime) {
        return "Token Expired";
    }

    riskScore = calculateRiskScore(transactionAmount, recipientId, imageCodeData, biometricData);

    if (riskScore > thresholdHigh) {
        requireAdditionalAuthentication();
        return "Authentication Required";
    }

    if (riskScore > thresholdMedium) {
        monitorTransaction();
    }

    if (token.isRevoked()) {
        return "Token Revoked";
    }

    if (transactionAmount > token.amount) {
        return "Insufficient Funds";
    }

    token.markUsed();
    transferFunds(token.userAccount, recipientAccount);
    return "Transaction Approved";
}
```

**Novelty & Potential:**

This system moves beyond static token validation by creating a 'living' token that adapts to the user’s behavior and biometric signature. This significantly enhances security, reduces fraud, and provides a more seamless user experience. The integration of continuous biometric authentication offers a higher level of assurance than traditional one-time passwords or PINs. The dynamic risk scoring system allows for adaptive security measures, balancing security with user convenience.  The ability to adapt dynamically offers a significant advantage over time-based or fixed amount token systems.
