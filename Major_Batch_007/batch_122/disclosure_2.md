## Personalized Skill Chaining with Anticipatory Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the user profile linking by introducing a system for *anticipatory* profile generation and skill chaining. Instead of solely reacting to user input and *then* requesting profile data, the system proactively builds a 'potential' profile based on contextual clues (time of day, location, calendar events, recent app usage) and *pre-fetches* likely skill requirements.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Anticipatory Profiler (AP)
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   NLP System User Profile (existing)
    *   Device Calendar (permission-based)
    *   Location Services (permission-based)
    *   App Usage Logs (permission-based)
    *   Time-of-Day Data
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Contextual Analysis:** AP continuously monitors context (time, location, calendar, app usage).
    2.  **Intent Prediction:**  Based on context, AP predicts likely user intents (e.g., "commute to work", "prepare for meeting", "evening relaxation"). This utilizes a pre-trained model, updated via user interaction.
    3.  **Skill Requirement Mapping:**  Each predicted intent is mapped to a set of potentially relevant skills.  A knowledge graph links intents to skills (e.g., "commute" -> "navigation", "traffic updates", "podcast playback").
    4.  **Potential Profile Generation:** A "potential profile" is constructed, outlining likely required user data for those skills.  This profile *does not* require user consent initially. It’s a speculative profile.
    5.  **Pre-fetching & Skill Priming:** The NLP system pre-fetches necessary profile data based on the potential profile. Skills are primed, preparing to accept data when available.
    6.  **Consent Request (Just-In-Time):** When the user *actually* initiates an action aligning with a predicted intent, a streamlined consent request appears. (“To improve your commute, can we access your work location?”)
    7.  **Profile Merging:** Upon consent, the newly acquired data is merged with the existing user profile.
    8.  **Skill Chaining:**  If the predicted intent requires multiple skills, the system chains them together seamlessly. For example, “set alarm,” “check traffic,” “begin navigation” – all executed automatically after consent.

**Pseudocode (AP Module):**

```
function analyzeContext() {
  time = getCurrentTime();
  location = getCurrentLocation();
  calendarEvents = getUpcomingCalendarEvents();
  appUsage = getRecentAppUsage();

  context = { time: time, location: location, events: calendarEvents, apps: appUsage };
  return context;
}

function predictIntent(context) {
  // Use a pre-trained ML model to predict user intent based on context
  intent = model.predict(context);
  return intent;
}

function mapIntentToSkills(intent) {
  // Consult a knowledge graph to find relevant skills for the intent
  skills = knowledgeGraph.getSkills(intent);
  return skills;
}

function generatePotentialProfile(skills) {
  profile = {};
  for (skill in skills) {
    profile[skill.requiredData] = "unknown";
  }
  return profile;
}

function prefetchData(potentialProfile) {
  for (dataItem in potentialProfile) {
    if(potentialProfile[dataItem] == "unknown") {
      // initiate request to NLP system for data
    }
  }
}

function handleUserAction(action) {
  context = analyzeContext();
  intent = predictIntent(context);
  if (intent == action.intent) {
    // Display streamlined consent request
  }
}
```

**Expansion Potential:**

*   **Dynamic Knowledge Graph:** Allow the knowledge graph to be updated based on user interactions and emerging skill capabilities.
*   **Proactive Consent Management:**  Provide users with granular control over pre-fetching and data usage.
*   **Skill Negotiation:** Allow skills to “negotiate” data requirements, reducing the amount of data requested from the user.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Pre-fetching:** Explore techniques like federated learning to pre-fetch data without directly accessing user profiles.
