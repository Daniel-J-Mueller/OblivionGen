## Dynamic Decoy Network Topology Generation

**Concept:** Expand upon the existing decoy content deployment by dynamically generating a decoy *network* topology alongside the content. Instead of simply deploying bait within an existing network, create a small, ephemeral network mirroring aspects of the production environment, populated with realistic-appearing (but fake) services and endpoints, and then actively direct traffic *to* that decoy network.

**Specs:**

**1. Decoy Network Generator Module:**
   *   Input: Network traffic analysis data (from the existing patent’s system).  Specifically, common service ports, protocol usage, and initial handshake patterns.
   *   Process:
        *   Based on the input, generate a network topology graph. Nodes represent services (e.g., web server, database, SSH).  Edges represent communication pathways. The generated graph should mimic common production network layouts (star, mesh, etc.) but be significantly smaller.
        *   Assign virtual IP addresses to each node within a dedicated, isolated network range (e.g., 10.200.x.x).  This range *must not* overlap with the production network.
        *   Deploy lightweight virtual machine (VM) or container instances to act as the nodes.  These instances require minimal resources.  Pre-configured images containing basic service emulators are required. (See ‘Service Emulator Library’ below)
        *   Configure virtual networking to route traffic between the nodes and provide external access (initially limited, see ‘Traffic Redirection Module’)

**2. Service Emulator Library:**
   *   A collection of lightweight service emulators, designed to respond to common network requests without performing any real functionality.
   *   Examples:
        *   Web Server Emulator:  Serves static HTML pages designed to *look* like legitimate application interfaces.  Should support basic HTTP/HTTPS.
        *   Database Emulator:  Accepts SQL queries, but returns pre-defined, harmless responses.  Designed to mimic common database systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL).
        *   SSH Emulator:  Accepts SSH connections, but presents a fake login prompt and logs any attempted credentials.
        *   SMTP Emulator: Accepts email submissions and logs sending IP addresses and email content.
   *   These emulators *must* be configurable to mimic the behavior of real services (e.g., response times, error rates).

**3. Traffic Redirection Module:**
   *   Input: Network traffic data, identifying potential targets for redirection.
   *   Process:
        *   Monitor network traffic for specific patterns (e.g., connections to known vulnerable services, attempts to access sensitive data).
        *   Apply redirection rules.  These rules should be based on:
            *   Destination IP address/port.
            *   Protocol.
            *   Payload content (e.g., keywords).
        *   Redirect matching traffic to the corresponding node in the generated decoy network.
        *   Implement a delay mechanism to simulate realistic network latency.
        *   Log all redirected traffic, including source IP address, destination IP address, and payload data.

**4.  Dynamic Topology Adaptation Engine:**
    *   Continuously analyzes redirected traffic to the decoy network.
    *   Adjusts the decoy network topology based on observed traffic patterns.  For example:
        *   If a particular service is receiving a high volume of traffic, add more instances of that service to the decoy network.
        *   If new services are being targeted, add those services to the decoy network.
        *   If an attacker is attempting to map the network, dynamically change the network topology to confuse them.
    *   Uses machine learning to predict future traffic patterns and proactively adapt the decoy network.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Topology Adaptation):**

```
loop:
  traffic_data = get_redirected_traffic()
  service_usage = analyze_service_usage(traffic_data)
  if service_usage[service_x] > threshold:
    add_instance(service_x)
  if new_service_detected(traffic_data):
    deploy_service(new_service)
  if attacker_mapping_detected():
    randomize_topology()
  update_topology_graph()
```

**Output:** A fully dynamic, ephemeral network designed to attract and analyze malicious traffic. This goes beyond simply deploying decoy content to actively *luring* attackers into a controlled environment, providing more detailed insights into their tactics and techniques.
