## Adaptive Granularity Streaming

**Concept:** Extend the windowing concept to be dynamically adjustable *during* stream processing, based on observed data characteristics. Instead of fixed or sliding windows, windows can expand, contract, or split/merge based on real-time data volume, event density, or the occurrence of specific patterns.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Granularity Controller:** A module responsible for monitoring the data stream and adjusting window sizes/configurations. It leverages configurable policies based on metrics like:
    *   **Event Rate:** High event rates trigger window splitting or contraction.
    *   **Data Volume:** Accumulating data within a window exceeding a threshold triggers splitting.
    *   **Pattern Detection:** Specific event sequences trigger window adjustments to isolate the pattern. (e.g., anomaly detected â€“ expand window to capture context).
*   **Dynamic Window Manager:**  Manages the creation, destruction, and merging of windows based on commands from the Granularity Controller.
*   **Stateful Aggregation Functions:** Existing aggregation functions are modified to handle dynamic window boundaries.  They must be able to ingest data and maintain state correctly as windows split, merge, or change size.
*   **Stream Sharding Awareness:**  The system should integrate with existing stream sharding mechanisms (as per Claim 5) to ensure that window adjustments are coordinated across shards.

**2.  Workflow:**

1.  Data stream ingested into the system.
2.  Granularity Controller continuously monitors the stream.
3.  Based on configured policies, the Controller issues commands to the Dynamic Window Manager.
4.  Dynamic Window Manager adjusts window configuration (splits, merges, expands, contracts).
5.  Stateful Aggregation Functions process data within the dynamically adjusted windows, maintaining consistent state.
6.  Results delivered to destination functions (as per original patent).

**3.  Pseudocode (Granularity Controller):**

```
FUNCTION monitorStream(dataStream):
  WHILE streamHasData(dataStream):
    event = getData(dataStream)
    updateMetrics(event)

    IF eventRate > threshold_high:
      splitWindow(currentWindow)
    ELSE IF eventRate < threshold_low:
      mergeWindows(adjacentWindows)

    IF dataVolume(currentWindow) > volumeThreshold:
      splitWindow(currentWindow)

    IF patternDetected(event):
      expandWindow(currentWindow, contextSize)
    ENDIF

  ENDFOR
ENDFUNCTION
```

**4.  State Management:**

*   **Incremental State Updates:** When splitting a window, the existing state is *divided* proportionally to the new window sizes. When merging, states are *combined*.
*   **State Replication:** For high availability, state can be replicated across multiple nodes.
*   **State Versioning:** Maintain state versions to handle potential inconsistencies during concurrent adjustments.

**5.  Scalability Considerations:**

*   **Distributed State Management:** Utilize a distributed key-value store to manage window state.
*   **Asynchronous Window Adjustments:**  Perform window adjustments asynchronously to avoid blocking data processing.
*   **Fine-Grained Locking:** Implement fine-grained locking to minimize contention during state updates.
