## Adaptive Key Sharding with Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the cluster approach described in the patent to dynamically shard cryptographic keys *across* the cluster, and proactively balance load not just based on current utilization, but *predicted* future request types.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Sharding Module:**

*   **Function:** Responsible for dividing a master cryptographic key into multiple shares.  Shares are generated using a secret sharing algorithm (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing) such that a threshold number of shares is required to reconstruct the original key.
*   **Input:** Master cryptographic key, desired level of redundancy (number of shares), threshold for reconstruction.
*   **Output:**  Set of key shares distributed to individual HSMs within the cluster.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   `share_generation(master_key, num_shares, threshold)`:  Implements the selected secret sharing algorithm.
    *   `distribute_shares(shares, hsm_cluster)`: Assigns each share to a unique HSM within the cluster.  HSM selection prioritizes physical separation and redundancy (avoiding all shares residing on adjacent physical devices).
    *   `reconstruct_key(share_set)`:  Combines sufficient shares to reconstruct the master key (called during cryptographic operation fulfillment).

**2. Predictive Load Balancer:**

*   **Function:**  Monitors incoming request types (e.g., encryption, decryption, signing, key generation) and *predicts* future request load based on historical data and potentially external data sources (e.g., application usage patterns).  Dynamically adjusts key share assignment and request routing to optimize performance and minimize latency.
*   **Input:** Historical request data, real-time request stream, external data sources (optional).
*   **Output:** Optimized key share assignment matrix, request routing table.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   `request_type_classification(request)`: Identifies the type of cryptographic operation requested.
    *   `load_prediction(request_history)`:  Uses a time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future request load by type.
    *   `key_share_assignment_optimization(predicted_load, hsm_cluster)`:  An optimization algorithm (e.g., linear programming) that determines the optimal assignment of key shares to HSMs based on predicted load.  The goal is to minimize the expected latency of cryptographic operations.  Considers HSM processing capacity, network latency, and the number of shares required to fulfill a request.
    *   `routing_table_generation(key_share_assignment)`: Creates a routing table that maps incoming requests to the HSM(s) holding the necessary key shares.

**3. Request Processing Flow:**

1.  Application sends cryptographic request.
2.  Predictive Load Balancer classifies request type and consults the routing table.
3.  Routing table directs the request to the appropriate HSM(s).
4.  HSM(s) reconstruct the necessary key shares (if not already cached).
5.  HSM(s) perform the cryptographic operation.
6.  Result is returned to the application.

**4.  Caching Layer:**

*   Implement a caching layer within each HSM to store frequently accessed key shares and intermediate results.
*   Cache invalidation policies should be based on time-to-live (TTL) and/or change detection mechanisms.

**5.  Security Considerations:**

*   Key shares must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
*   Secure communication channels (e.g., TLS) must be used between HSMs and the Predictive Load Balancer.
*   Access control policies must be enforced to prevent unauthorized access to key shares.
*   Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.
