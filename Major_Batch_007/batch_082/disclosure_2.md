## Temporal Causality Graphs for Distributed Debugging

**Specification:** A system for constructing and visualizing temporal causality graphs within a distributed application, enabling pinpoint debugging of non-deterministic behavior.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of merely identifying *that* a non-deterministic event occurred, this system aims to map *why* it occurred by tracing the chain of events leading to it, leveraging timestamps and inter-component communication logs.

**Components:**

1.  **Instrumentation Library:**  A library injected into each independently executable component. This library performs:
    *   **Event Logging:**  Logs all significant internal events (function calls, variable assignments, data structure modifications) with high-resolution timestamps.  Events are tagged with component ID and a unique event ID.
    *   **Communication Interception:** Intercepts all inter-component communication (messages, RPC calls, shared memory access).  Logs sender/receiver IDs, message content (or a hash thereof), and timestamps.
    *   **Causality Metadata:**  Each event and communication record includes metadata indicating potential causal relationships.  This metadata is initially sparse, representing assumptions about likely dependencies (e.g., a function call likely causes subsequent actions within that function).

2.  **Centralized Log Aggregator:** Collects event logs from all components.  Scalability is achieved through a distributed message queue (e.g., Kafka).

3.  **Causality Graph Builder:**  A component that analyzes the aggregated logs and constructs a directed graph representing causal relationships.
    *   **Temporal Ordering:** Events are initially ordered within each component based on timestamps.
    *   **Dependency Analysis:** The system searches for potential causal dependencies.  A dependency is established if:
        *   Event A (in Component X) precedes Event B (in Component Y).
        *   Event A *influenced* Event B. Influence is determined by:
            *   Direct data flow:  Data written by Event A is read by Event B.
            *   Control flow:  Event A triggered Event B (e.g., an RPC call).
            *   Temporal proximity:  If no direct influence can be established, events within a short time window are considered potentially related. A configurable threshold determines this.
    *   **Graph Construction:**  Nodes represent events. Edges represent causal relationships. Edge weights represent the strength of the causality (determined by the evidence).

4.  **Visualization & Debugging Interface:**  A user interface for visualizing the causality graph and navigating the execution history.
    *   **Interactive Graph:**  Users can zoom, pan, and filter the graph.
    *   **Event Details:**  Clicking on a node displays detailed information about the event (code location, variables, arguments).
    *   **Reverse Causality:**  Users can trace the chain of events *leading up to* a specific non-deterministic event.
    *   **"What-If" Analysis:**  Simulate alternative execution paths by modifying event data or delaying/reordering events.

**Pseudocode (Causality Graph Builder):**

```pseudocode
function buildCausalityGraph(eventLogs):
  graph = new DirectedGraph()

  for event in eventLogs:
    graph.addNode(event.eventID, event)

  for eventA in eventLogs:
    for eventB in eventLogs:
      if eventA.timestamp < eventB.timestamp:
        if isInfluenced(eventA, eventB): #Determines if A influenced B based on data/control flow.
          graph.addEdge(eventA.eventID, eventB.eventID, weight=calculateWeight(eventA, eventB)) #Calculate weight based on influence strength

  return graph
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simply *detecting* non-determinism. It aims to map the *entire causal chain* leading to it, providing engineers with a powerful tool for understanding and debugging complex distributed applications.  The 'What-If' analysis capability enables proactive exploration of potential issues. The system isn't limited to a pre-defined model of relationships, but rather builds it dynamically from runtime execution logs.
