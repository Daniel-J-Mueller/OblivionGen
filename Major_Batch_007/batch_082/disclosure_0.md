## Dynamic Computation Graph Orchestration

**Concept:** Extend the event-driven, storage-mediated computation model to support dynamically constructed computation graphs. Instead of pre-defined computations triggered by data arrival, allow event handlers to *build* subsequent computations based on intermediate results. This creates a flexible, adaptive system capable of handling complex, evolving workloads.

**Specifications:**

*   **Graph Construction Language (GCL):** Define a lightweight, declarative language that event handlers use to specify the next computation(s) to be performed. GCL should focus on dependencies between computations and data flow, minimizing operational detail. Syntax example:
    ```gcl
    computation: "aggregate_data"
    inputs: ["intermediate_result_1", "intermediate_result_2"]
    output: "aggregated_result"
    handler_type: "analytics_handler"
    priority: "high"
    ```
*   **Graph Orchestrator Service:** A central service responsible for receiving GCL specifications from event handlers, validating them, and scheduling the corresponding computations. The orchestrator maintains a global view of the computation graph.
*   **Event Handler Augmentation:** Enhance event handlers with the ability to:
    *   Parse intermediate results and determine the next computation(s) required.
    *   Construct GCL specifications dynamically.
    *   Submit GCL specifications to the Graph Orchestrator Service.
    *   Receive completion notifications for downstream computations.
*   **Storage System Integration:** The storage system acts as a shared workspace for intermediate results and GCL specifications. A dedicated metadata field should store GCL specifications associated with each result.
*   **Adaptive Scheduling:** The Graph Orchestrator Service employs an adaptive scheduling algorithm that considers:
    *   Computation priority (specified in GCL).
    *   Data dependencies.
    *   Resource availability.
    *   Handler type affinity (match handler type to available resources).
*   **Error Handling & Recovery:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms:
    *   Failed computations trigger alternative paths (defined in GCL).
    *   Automatic retry mechanisms.
    *   Deadlock detection and resolution.

**Pseudocode (Event Handler Logic):**

```
function process_data(input_data):
  # Perform initial computation
  result = perform_initial_computation(input_data)

  # Analyze result and determine next computation
  next_computation = determine_next_computation(result)

  # Construct GCL specification
  if next_computation:
    gcl_specification = construct_gcl(next_computation, result)
  else:
    #No further computations needed
    return result

  #Submit GCL to Orchestrator
  orchestrator_response = submit_gcl(gcl_specification)

  #Handle Orchestrator response (e.g., scheduling confirmation, errors)
  if orchestrator_response.status == "success":
    #Continue with other tasks
    pass
  else:
    #Handle error
    pass

  return result
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Complex Data Analytics:** Building dynamic analytical pipelines based on real-time data patterns.
*   **Machine Learning Model Training:** Automatically constructing and optimizing training workflows.
*   **Scientific Simulations:** Adapting simulation parameters based on intermediate results.
*   **Real-time Decision Making:** Constructing decision trees on-the-fly based on changing conditions.
