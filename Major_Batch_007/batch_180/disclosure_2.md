## Adaptive Interference Cancellation via Distributed Beamforming

**Concept:** Leverage the RSSI/RSQI data *not* just for power saving, but for dynamically forming ad-hoc beamforming networks between devices experiencing similar interference patterns. This moves beyond simple power reduction to *active* interference mitigation, improving overall network throughput and reliability.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires devices to have at least two antennas, and reasonably accurate antenna phase/amplitude control. Existing WiFi 6/6E/7 chipsets have this capability.
*   **Software - Initial Phase (Data Collection & Mapping):**
    *   Each device continuously monitors RSSI/RSQI of *all* detectable wireless signals (not just its paired device).
    *   Data is time-stamped and locally stored.
    *   Devices analyze this data to identify common interference sources – correlating signal characteristics (frequency, modulation, apparent source location - estimated via triangulation from multiple RSSI readings).
    *   A 'interference map' is built, categorizing interference by type (e.g., Bluetooth, microwave, rogue WiFi AP).
*   **Software - Network Formation & Beamforming:**
    *   Devices periodically broadcast a 'interference profile' – a summary of their interference map.
    *   Devices compare interference profiles.  If a significant overlap is detected (e.g., both devices are heavily impacted by the same rogue AP), a temporary beamforming network is established.
    *   A designated 'coordinator' device (determined via a simple negotiation – lowest MAC address wins, for example) calculates beamforming weights. This calculation requires sharing RSSI/RSQI readings of the interfering signal.
    *   Devices adjust antenna phase/amplitude according to the calculated weights, creating a null in the direction of the interference source.  This requires precise timing synchronization.
*   **Software - Dynamic Adaptation:**
    *   RSSI/RSQI monitoring continues *during* beamforming.
    *   If interference characteristics change (e.g., the source moves, another source appears), the coordinator recalculates beamforming weights.
    *   If beamforming isn't effective (RSSI/RSQI doesn't improve significantly), the network is dissolved.
*   **Pseudocode (Coordinator Device - Beamforming Weight Calculation):**

```
function calculate_beamforming_weights(rssi_interferer_device1, rssi_interferer_device2, angle_device1, angle_device2):
  // rssi_interferer: RSSI of the interfering signal at each device
  // angle_device: Angle of the interfering signal source relative to each device
  
  // Calculate phase difference based on distance to interfering signal
  phase_difference = 2 * PI * (distance_device1 - distance_device2) / wavelength

  // Calculate weight factors based on RSSI and phase difference
  weight1 = (rssi_interferer_device2 * cos(phase_difference))
  weight2 = (rssi_interferer_device1 * cos(0))

  // Normalize weights (ensure sum is 1)
  total_weight = weight1 + weight2
  weight1 = weight1 / total_weight
  weight2 = weight2 / total_weight
  
  return weight1, weight2
```

*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   Machine learning could be used to predict interference patterns and proactively form beamforming networks.
    *   Multiple devices could cooperate to form a more complex beamforming array.
    *   The system could prioritize beamforming based on the importance of the communication link (e.g., prioritize voice calls over file downloads).
