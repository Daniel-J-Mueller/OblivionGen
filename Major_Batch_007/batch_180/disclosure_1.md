## Dynamic Network Topology Sculpting

**Concept:** Extend the multi-account gateway functionality to allow *dynamic* reconfiguration of network topologies based on application demand and network conditions, effectively creating 'network sculptures' tailored to specific workloads. The current patent focuses on static address allocation and routing. This adds a layer of responsive, automated topology alteration.

**Specifications:**

**1. Topology Definition Language (TDL):**

*   A declarative language for defining desired network topologies. This language will allow administrators (or automated systems) to specify relationships between configurable networks, desired latency characteristics, bandwidth requirements, and security policies.
*   TDL will support concepts like:
    *   Network ‘nodes’ representing configurable networks.
    *   ‘Edges’ defining connectivity and bandwidth allocations.
    *   ‘Policies’ dictating traffic flow and security parameters.
    *   ‘Constraints’ defining acceptable latency or bandwidth ranges.
*   Example TDL Snippet:

```tdl
network HomeNetwork {
    prefix: 192.168.1.0/24
    gateway: gw-home
}

network ProductionNetwork {
    prefix: 10.0.0.0/16
    gateway: gw-prod
}

edge HomeNetwork <-> ProductionNetwork {
    bandwidth: 10Gbps
    latency: < 10ms
    security: encrypted
}

policy ProductionNetwork -> HomeNetwork {
    allow: web-traffic
    block: database-traffic
}
```

**2. Topology Sculptor Service:**

*   A service responsible for interpreting TDL definitions and translating them into actual network configurations.
*   Operates continuously, monitoring network conditions and comparing them against desired topologies.
*   Employs a reinforcement learning (RL) agent trained to optimize network topology based on performance metrics (latency, throughput, packet loss).
*   The RL agent considers network state (congestion, link utilization) and application demand to make topology adjustment decisions.

**3. Virtual Network Fabric Controller (VNFC):**

*   A software-defined networking (SDN) controller responsible for configuring network devices (routers, switches, firewalls) to implement desired topologies.
*   Receives instructions from the Topology Sculptor Service and translates them into low-level device configurations.
*   Utilizes existing SDN protocols (OpenFlow, P4) to program network devices.
*   Supports dynamic creation and deletion of virtual network interfaces and tunnels.

**4. Topology Snapshot & Rollback:**

*   Mechanism to capture the current network topology as a ‘snapshot’.
*   If a topology change results in degraded performance, the system can automatically roll back to the previous snapshot.
*   Snapshotting includes configuration details of all network devices and routing tables.

**Pseudocode (Topology Sculptor Service - Core Logic):**

```pseudocode
function optimize_topology(tdl_definition, current_network_state, application_demand):
    desired_topology = parse_tdl(tdl_definition)
    reward = calculate_reward(current_network_state, application_demand, desired_topology)
    action = rl_agent.select_action(reward)  // e.g., adjust bandwidth, create/delete tunnel
    vnfc.apply_action(action)
    updated_network_state = monitor_network()
    return updated_network_state
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   SDN-capable network devices.
*   High-performance servers for running the Topology Sculptor Service and VNFC.
*   Real-time network monitoring tools.
*   Machine learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for training the RL agent.
