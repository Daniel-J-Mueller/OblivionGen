**Innovation Description:**

Instead of relying solely on ultrasonic signals which can be computationally expensive and suffer from environmental interference, this system creates a ‘vibration map’ of an environment by continuously monitoring ambient vibrations. This data is analyzed to predict occupancy *before* movement occurs.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Calibration:** During initial setup, the accelerometer array learns the ‘baseline’ vibration profile of the environment (HVAC, traffic, etc.).
2.  **Data Acquisition:**  The array continuously captures vibration data from all sensors.
3.  **Feature Extraction:**  The system extracts features from the vibration data, including frequency components, amplitude, and spatial distribution of vibrations.
4.  **ML Model Training:**  A machine learning model (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network – RNN) is trained on labeled data to correlate vibration patterns with occupancy. Crucially, the model learns to predict *imminent* movement based on subtle changes in vibration patterns (e.g., a person shifting weight before standing up).
5.  **Predictive Presence Detection:** The trained model analyzes real-time vibration data and outputs a probability score indicating the likelihood of occupancy.
6.  **Zone Mapping:** Vibration ‘hotspots’ are correlated to spatial zones. For example, identifying if a vibration originates from a seated or standing position, or near a doorway.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Calibration Phase
baselineVibration = captureVibrationData(duration = 60 seconds)
baselineFFT = performFFT(baselineVibration)

// Real-time Processing
while (true) {
    vibrationData = captureVibrationData(duration = 1 second)
    fftData = performFFT(vibrationData)

    // Feature Extraction
    featureVector = extractFeatures(fftData, baselineFFT) // Includes frequency changes, amplitude differences

    // Prediction
    probability = predictOccupancy(featureVector, trainedModel)

    if (probability > threshold) {
        triggerEvent("Occupancy Detected")
    }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Person Identification:**  Using subtle differences in gait and body movement, train the model to identify individuals.
*   **Fall Detection:** Analyze sudden changes in vibration patterns to detect falls.
*   **Activity Recognition:**  Identify specific activities (e.g., typing, walking) based on vibration signatures.
*   **Integration with Lighting/HVAC:**  Automate lighting and HVAC control based on predicted occupancy.
*   **Multi-Sensor Fusion:**  Combine vibration data with other sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity) for more accurate occupancy detection.
