## Adaptive Predictive Maintenance via Event Model Correlation

**Specification:** System for predictive maintenance leveraging correlated event detector models across distributed IoT devices.

**Core Concept:** Rather than solely focusing on verifying the *correctness* of individual event detector models, this system focuses on establishing and utilizing *correlations* between models deployed on different devices to predict maintenance needs. The system assumes subtle failures manifest as deviations in these correlated event patterns *before* a catastrophic failure occurs.

**Components:**

1.  **Event Model Repository:** Stores all deployed event detector models, their definitions (as per the provided patent), and historical event data generated by those models.  Crucially, includes metadata about the *physical asset* each model is associated with (e.g., pump serial number, turbine type).
2.  **Correlation Engine:** The core component. This engine analyzes historical event data from multiple event detector models to identify statistically significant correlations.  This isn't simply "event A followed by event B"; it’s a more nuanced analysis considering timing, frequency, and the specific *asset* associated with each event.  It employs Bayesian networks to model the dependencies between events.
3.  **Deviation Detector:** Monitors real-time event streams. When observed event patterns deviate from established correlations (as determined by the Correlation Engine), the Deviation Detector raises an alert.  Alert severity is calculated based on the degree of deviation and the historical criticality of similar deviations.
4.  **Maintenance Recommendation Engine:**  Based on the Deviation Detector’s alerts, this engine provides specific maintenance recommendations.  These recommendations aren’t static; they are dynamically adjusted based on the asset’s history, the type of deviation, and the estimated remaining useful life.
5.  **Self-Learning Feedback Loop:**  Data from completed maintenance actions is fed back into the system to refine the correlation models and improve the accuracy of future predictions.

**Pseudocode – Correlation Engine (Simplified):**

```
function calculate_correlation(event_data_set, asset_type):
  // event_data_set is a list of events, each with timestamp, event_type, asset_id
  // asset_type is a string describing the type of asset

  // Filter event data for the specified asset type
  filtered_events = filter_events_by_asset_type(event_data_set, asset_type)

  // Create a Bayesian network to represent dependencies
  bn = create_bayesian_network()

  // Add nodes to the network for each event type
  for event in unique_events(filtered_events):
    bn.add_node(event)

  // Learn conditional probabilities from the historical data
  bn.learn_probabilities(filtered_events)

  return bn

function detect_deviation(current_events, historical_bn, threshold):
  // current_events is a list of events observed in real-time
  // historical_bn is the Bayesian network learned from historical data
  // threshold is the acceptable level of deviation

  // Calculate the probability of observing the current events given the historical network
  probability = historical_bn.calculate_probability(current_events)

  // If the probability is below the threshold, a deviation is detected
  if probability < threshold:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  IoT devices generate data, triggering events within their deployed event detector models.
2.  Events are streamed to the Correlation Engine.
3.  The Correlation Engine updates its Bayesian network models.
4.  Real-time event streams are compared to the models.
5.  Deviations trigger alerts, which are processed by the Maintenance Recommendation Engine.
6.  Maintenance actions are recorded, providing feedback to refine the correlation models.

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond simple event detection and correctness verification.  It focuses on the *relationships* between events across distributed assets, enabling proactive maintenance based on subtle anomalies that might otherwise go unnoticed.  The Bayesian network modeling allows for probabilistic reasoning and a more nuanced understanding of system behavior.
