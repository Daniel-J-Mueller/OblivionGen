## Modular Payload & Attitude Control System – "Sky-Brick"

**Concept:** A standardized, magnetically-locking payload system combined with dynamically shifting internal mass to optimize attitude control, reducing reliance on traditional control surfaces or rotor adjustments. 

**Core Innovation:** Instead of *only* shifting landing gear or external payloads, we introduce a network of internal, movable “Sky-Bricks” – dense, geometrically shaped masses – distributed within the airframe. These combine with a standardized, magnetically-locking external payload interface.



**I. Sky-Brick Specifications:**

*   **Form Factor:** Cuboid, 10cm x 10cm x 10cm. Multiple sizes possible, but 10cm is the baseline.
*   **Mass:** 2 kg (baseline). Variable mass versions possible – 1kg, 3kg, 5kg.
*   **Actuation:** Linear actuators (miniature ball screw) integrated within the airframe, allowing each Sky-Brick to translate along one or more axes (X, Y, Z).
*   **Material:** High-density alloy (Tungsten alloy preferred) encased in a lightweight polymer shell.
*   **Position Sensors:**  High-precision encoders integrated with each linear actuator to report real-time position data.
*   **Communication:** CAN bus interface for control and data reporting.
*   **Power:** Localized power distribution within the airframe to minimize wiring complexity.

**II. Payload Interface:**

*   **Mounting:** Standardized magnetic interface (high-strength neodymium magnets) to quickly and securely attach various payloads.  A mechanical locking mechanism as a backup.
*   **Payload Mass Range:** 1kg - 10kg.
*   **Payload Interface Dimensions:** 20cm x 20cm x 10cm (allows for various payload shapes).
*   **Integrated Data/Power:** Payload interface provides power and data communication via standardized connectors.

**III. Control System Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Global Variables
desiredOrientation (yaw, pitch, roll)
currentOrientation (yaw, pitch, roll)
payloadMass
skyBrickMassArray[number of sky bricks]
skyBrickPositionArray[number of sky bricks]

// Function: Calculate Center of Gravity
function calculateCOG() {
  // Calculate COG based on airframe mass, payload mass, and sky brick positions/masses
  // Return COG coordinates (X, Y, Z)
}

// Function: Calculate Attitude Correction
function calculateAttitudeCorrection() {
  // Determine the difference between desiredOrientation and currentOrientation
  // Calculate the required moment of inertia to correct the attitude
  // Determine the optimal sky brick positions and payload position to achieve the required moment of inertia
  // Return sky brick position array and payload position
}

// Main Control Loop
loop {
  currentOrientation = getSensorData()
  if (currentOrientation != desiredOrientation) {
    skyBrickPositions, payloadPosition = calculateAttitudeCorrection()

    // Actuate sky bricks and payload to new positions
    for each sky brick in skyBrickPositions {
      actuateSkyBrick(sky brick, sky brick.position)
    }
    actuatePayload(payload, payload.position)
  }
}
```

**IV.  System Expansion – “Sky-Web”**

*   **Inter-Brick Communication:**  Equip each Sky-Brick with short-range wireless communication (UWB).
*   **Distributed Processing:**  Enable basic attitude correction calculations *within* each Sky-Brick. This reduces the load on the central processor.
*   **Dynamic Formation Control:**  Allow Sky-Bricks to autonomously adjust their positions to optimize attitude control. This is especially useful for maneuvering in complex environments.



**Rationale:** This system allows for significantly more precise and responsive attitude control. Internal mass shifting is faster and less affected by external forces than relying solely on control surfaces or rotor adjustments. The modular payload interface provides flexibility and allows for a wide range of applications. The Sky-Web expansion introduces a layer of redundancy and resilience, improving overall system reliability. This is a new architecture for aerial vehicle control, which could revolutionize the capabilities of UAVs.
