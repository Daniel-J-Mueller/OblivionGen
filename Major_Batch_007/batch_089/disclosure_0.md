## Adaptive Session Key Rotation via Blockchain Timestamping

**Concept:** Extend the session decoupling concept by introducing a blockchain-based timestamping system for session key rotation. This enhances security by providing verifiable proof of key validity and rotation times, particularly useful in scenarios with untrusted intermediaries or complex network topologies.

**Specification:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Initiating Application (IA):** The application initiating the secure session (as in the patent).
*   **Responding Application (RA):** The application responding to the secure session.
*   **Blockchain Network (BN):** A permissioned or public blockchain network (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum).
*   **Timestamping Service (TS):** An application component responsible for interacting with the BN. This could be integrated into either the IA or RA, or be a separate service.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Session Initiation:** IA and RA establish a TLS session as described in the provided patent. A unique session identifier (SessionID) is generated.
2.  **Initial Key Timestamping:**  Upon successful key exchange during TLS negotiation, the IA (or TS) submits a transaction to the BN.  This transaction contains:
    *   SessionID
    *   Current Key Fingerprint (hash of the symmetric key)
    *   Timestamp (generated by TS)
    *   Key Validity Period (e.g., 24 hours)
3.  **Key Rotation Trigger:**  The IA determines a key rotation trigger (e.g., time-based, data volume-based, anomaly detection).
4.  **New Key Exchange & Timestamping:** Before the current key expires, a new key is negotiated (using a Diffie-Hellman exchange or similar). The IA (or TS) submits *another* transaction to the BN with:
    *   SessionID
    *   New Key Fingerprint
    *   Timestamp
    *   Validity Period
    *   Reference to Previous Key Transaction (transaction ID from the previous key submission).
5.  **Key Verification:**  The RA, upon receiving a message, can *verify* the key's validity by querying the BN for the latest key transaction associated with the SessionID. It checks:
    *   The current time against the key's validity period.
    *   That the key fingerprint in the message matches the key fingerprint from the blockchain.
    *   That the key transaction is part of a valid chain of key rotations (ensuring no tampering).

**3. Pseudocode (RA Key Verification):**

```pseudocode
function verifyMessage(message, sessionID):
    blockchain = connectToBlockchain()
    latestKeyTransaction = blockchain.getTransaction(sessionID)

    if latestKeyTransaction == null:
        return false // Session not found

    currentKeyFingerprint = message.getKeyFingerprint()
    blockchainKeyFingerprint = latestKeyTransaction.getKeyFingerprint()

    if currentKeyFingerprint != blockchainKeyFingerprint:
        return false // Key mismatch

    currentTime = getCurrentTime()
    validFrom = latestKeyTransaction.getValidFrom()
    validUntil = latestKeyTransaction.getValidUntil()

    if currentTime < validFrom or currentTime > validUntil:
        return false // Key expired

    // Optionally: Verify transaction chain integrity to prevent replay attacks
    // (check parent transaction ID)

    return true // Key valid
```

**4.  Transport Mechanism Adaptability:**

This system is *agnostic* to the transport mechanism (TCP, UDP, etc.) used. The blockchain verification happens at the application layer *after* the message has been received via the transport layer.  The decoupling aspect of the source patent remains intact.

**5.  Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):**  Instead of revealing the full key fingerprint on the blockchain, use ZKPs to prove key validity without revealing the key itself.
*   **Off-Chain Storage:** Store large cryptographic artifacts off-chain (e.g., in a distributed storage system) and only store hashes on the blockchain to reduce blockchain bloat and costs.
*   **Smart Contract Automation:** Use a smart contract on the blockchain to automatically revoke keys that have expired or been compromised.
