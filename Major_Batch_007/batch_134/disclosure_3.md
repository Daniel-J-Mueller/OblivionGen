## Dynamic Vector Remapping for Pipeline Parallelism

**Concept:** Enhance pipeline throughput by dynamically remapping data vectors (both information and control) to available processing stages *before* they reach those stages. This allows for load balancing and optimized resource utilization. The existing patent focuses on *splitting* vectors, this expands on *moving* them.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   **Vector Dispatch Unit (VDU):** Situated between the first pipeline stage (splitting stage) and the subsequent stages. The VDU analyzes incoming vectors (information and control) and their associated metadata.
    *   **Stage Availability Map:** A constantly updated map reflecting the current load/availability of each stage in the pipeline. This map is maintained by a central control unit, receiving signals from each stage indicating processing completion, idle time, and resource requirements.
    *   **Dynamic Remapping Engine (DRE):** The core of the system. Based on the Stage Availability Map and vector metadata, the DRE determines the optimal destination stage for each vector. It supports both information and control vectors.
    *   **Inter-Stage Communication Network:** A high-bandwidth, low-latency network connecting the VDU, DRE, and all pipeline stages.
    *   **Metadata Tags:** Each vector will have an associated tag with metadata including: priority, data dependencies, processing requirements (e.g., specific instruction set needed), and original intended stage.

*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Load Balancing Algorithm:** Implemented within the DRE, this algorithm utilizes the Stage Availability Map and vector metadata to determine the optimal destination stage. Strategies include: Round Robin, Least Loaded, Priority-Based, and Dependency-Aware.
    *   **Stage Handshaking Protocol:** A protocol allowing stages to communicate their availability and resource requirements to the DRE.
    *   **Vector Tagging and Metadata Management:** Firmware to handle the creation, updating, and interpretation of vector tags and metadata.
    *   **Error Handling and Recovery:** Mechanisms to handle scenarios where a vector cannot be remapped or encounters errors during processing.

*   **Operation:**
    1.  The first stage splits the data into information and control vectors.
    2.  The vectors are passed to the VDU.
    3.  The VDU reads the vector metadata.
    4.  The DRE queries the Stage Availability Map.
    5.  The DRE, using the Load Balancing Algorithm, determines the optimal destination stage for each vector.
    6.  The DRE redirects the vectors via the Inter-Stage Communication Network to their assigned stages.
    7.  Stages process the vectors and update their status on the Stage Availability Map.

**Pseudocode (DRE â€“ Simplified):**

```
function remapVector(vector, metadata):
  stageAvailabilityMap = getStageAvailabilityMap()
  optimalStage = findOptimalStage(stageAvailabilityMap, metadata)
  sendVectorToStage(vector, optimalStage)

function findOptimalStage(stageAvailabilityMap, metadata):
  // Apply Load Balancing Algorithm (e.g., Least Loaded)
  eligibleStages = filterStages(stageAvailabilityMap, metadata)
  if eligibleStages is empty:
    return defaultStage // Or signal an error

  leastLoadedStage = findLeastLoaded(eligibleStages)
  return leastLoadedStage

function filterStages(stageAvailabilityMap, metadata):
  // Check if stage supports required operations (metadata)
  // Check if stage is not overloaded
  return list of eligible stages
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased pipeline throughput by balancing load across stages.
*   Improved resource utilization.
*   Adaptability to varying workloads and data patterns.
*   Potential for reducing power consumption by activating only necessary stages.
