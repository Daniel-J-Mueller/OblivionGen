**Personalized Meal Kit Integration & Proactive Ingredient Ordering**

**Concept:** Expand predictive ordering beyond *prepared* meals to encompass meal kits and proactively manage ingredient inventory, reducing food waste and tailoring kits to customer dietary needs/preferences *before* they even think to order.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Historical order data (as in the base patent).
    *   Explicit dietary restrictions/allergies (user profile).
    *   Nutritional goals (user profile - e.g., high protein, low carb).
    *   Recipe database (extensive, linked to ingredient suppliers).
    *   Ingredient pricing and availability (real-time API feeds).
    *   Household size (user profile).
    *   Pantry inventory (optional - image recognition via user's device camera).
*   **Predictive Engine Enhancements:**
    *   Recipe Preference Modeling:  Beyond simply predicting *what* a customer will order, the system predicts *what type of meal* theyâ€™ll want (Italian, Asian, Vegetarian, etc.).  This utilizes a recipe database and clusters similar recipes based on ingredient profiles.
    *   Ingredient Depletion Prediction: Based on recipe choices and household size, the system estimates ingredient depletion rates.
    *   Nutritional Gap Analysis: Compares the customer's recent dietary intake (if tracked via connected apps or manual input) with their nutritional goals, identifying nutrient deficiencies.
*   **System Workflow:**
    1.  **Contextual Analysis:** Collects current & scheduled status, dietary data, nutritional gaps.
    2.  **Recipe Suggestion:**  Generates a ranked list of potential recipes based on predicted preferences, nutritional needs, and ingredient availability.
    3.  **Kit Generation:**  Constructs a personalized meal kit recipe (or series of recipes for a week) based on the suggested recipes.
    4.  **Ingredient Ordering:**
        *   **Inventory Check:** If pantry inventory is enabled, verifies existing ingredient stock.
        *   **Automatic Order Placement:** Orders missing ingredients from partnered suppliers (or offers a shopping list if the user prefers).  Prioritizes ingredients with short shelf lives.
    5.  **Delivery Scheduling:** Schedules kit delivery (or ingredient delivery) to coincide with optimal meal preparation times.
    6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously monitors ingredient usage and adjusts future orders accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Ingredient Ordering Module):**

```
FUNCTION OrderIngredients(customerID, recipeList, pantryInventory)

  missingIngredients = []

  FOR each recipe IN recipeList:
    FOR each ingredient IN recipe.ingredients:
      IF ingredient NOT IN pantryInventory OR pantryInventory[ingredient] < recipe.ingredientQuantity[ingredient]:
        missingIngredients.append(ingredient)

  IF missingIngredients IS NOT EMPTY:
    ingredientCosts = GetIngredientCosts(missingIngredients) //API Call
    totalCost = Sum(ingredientCosts)
    IF totalCost > userBudget:
      Sort missingIngredients by nutritionalValue //Prioritize
      Remove leastNutritious until totalCost < userBudget

    PlaceOrder(missingIngredients, userShippingAddress)
    UpdatePantryInventory(deliveredIngredients)

  END
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   API Integration with ingredient suppliers (essential).
*   Image recognition software for pantry inventory (optional but valuable).
*   Secure data storage for user dietary information.
*   Scalable cloud infrastructure to handle large datasets.
