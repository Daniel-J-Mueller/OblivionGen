## Autonomous Vehicle Swarm Topology Adjustment via Bio-Inspired Signaling

**System Overview:**

This system builds on the concept of AGV traffic management but introduces dynamic swarm topology adjustments inspired by flocking bird behavior and slime mold pathfinding. Instead of relying solely on proximity-based slowdown/stop signals, AGVs will communicate to establish optimal paths *collectively*, adapting to obstacles and dynamically shifting 'leader' roles.

**Core Components:**

*   **AGV Node:** Each AGV is equipped with:
    *   Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio for precise, short-range communication (distance accuracy < 30cm).
    *   Directional microphone array for detecting ambient sound and identifying nearby AGV 'calls'.
    *   Onboard processing unit for executing swarm algorithms.
    *   Low-power Bluetooth for connection to a central management system (reporting only, not control).
*   **'Call' Signals:** AGVs emit distinct ‘calls’ representing:
    *   **‘Clear Path’:** Indicates a free, optimal trajectory.
    *   **‘Obstacle Detected’:** Signals a barrier or congestion.  Includes direction and estimated distance to the obstacle.
    *   **‘Request Assistance’:**  Indicates an AGV is experiencing difficulty navigating or is blocked.
    *   **‘Topology Shift’:**  A signal to initiate a localized re-routing process.
*   **Virtual 'Pheromone' Mapping:** Each AGV builds a local map of 'virtual pheromones' based on received ‘Clear Path’ signals. Higher pheromone concentrations represent preferred routes. Pheromone trails decay over time to reflect dynamic conditions.
*   **Leader Election:** Based on pheromone trail strength and relative position, AGVs dynamically elect 'leaders'. Leaders broadcast ‘Topology Shift’ signals to initiate localized re-routing when necessary.
* **Dynamic Mesh Networking:** AGVs communicate with each other to form a decentralized mesh network.  The mesh topology adjusts dynamically based on AGV proximity and communication quality.

**Pseudocode (AGV Node Core Loop):**

```
// Initialization
Initialize UWB, Microphone Array, Mesh Network
Build Initial Pheromone Map (based on known static obstacles)

while (true) {
  // 1. Sense Environment
  obstacleDetected = DetectObstacle(UWB, Microphone Array)
  nearbyAGVs = DetectNearbyAGVs(UWB)

  // 2. Signal & Communicate
  if (obstacleDetected) {
    Broadcast("Obstacle Detected", obstacleDirection, obstacleDistance)
  }
  Broadcast("Clear Path", currentDirection) //Regularly broadcast clear path

  // 3. Receive Signals from Nearby AGVs
  receivedSignals = ReceiveSignals()

  // 4. Update Pheromone Map
  for each signal in receivedSignals:
    if signal.type == "Obstacle Detected":
      DecreasePheromone(signal.direction, signal.distance)
    else if signal.type == "Clear Path":
      IncreasePheromone(signal.direction)

  // 5. Leader Election (local, within communication range)
  leader = ElectLeader(nearbyAGVs)

  // 6. Path Planning & Navigation
  if (leader != self) {
    FollowLeaderPath(leader)
  } else {
    PlanPath(destination, pheromoneMap)
    Navigate(plannedPath)
  }

  // 7. Report Status (to Management System - low priority)
  ReportStatus(location, speed, path, pheromoneMapSummary)
}
```

*   **Microphone Array:** 4-element array, beamforming capabilities, noise cancellation.
*   **Processing Unit:** ARM Cortex-A72 quad-core processor, 8GB RAM, 64GB storage.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Custom mesh networking protocol built on top of IEEE 802.15.4.
*   **Pheromone Map:**  Grid-based map with adjustable resolution (e.g., 10cm x 10cm cells).
* **AGV Dimensions**: Standardized chassis with modular component integration.
* **Power**: High density battery packs with inductive wireless charging.

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple proximity-based collision avoidance to a distributed, bio-inspired approach to traffic management. The swarm topology adjustment enables AGVs to adapt to dynamic environments more effectively and efficiently than traditional methods. The combination of UWB, microphone arrays, and pheromone mapping creates a robust and resilient system. This allows for the avoidance of bottlenecks and congestion in warehouses and manufacturing environments.
