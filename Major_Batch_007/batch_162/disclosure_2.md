## Dynamic Temporal Webpage Reconstruction

**Concept:** Leverage historical webpage data (as implied by claim 19-21) not just for display *of* past versions, but to *reconstruct* a webpage as it dynamically loaded for a specific user at a specific time. Think beyond static snapshots to a replay of the original user experience.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Capture Agent:** A browser extension/proxy server component installed on user devices (optional - server-side capture also possible). This agent intercepts all webpage requests, responses (HTML, CSS, Javascript, images, etc.), and timing information (time to first byte, DNS lookup time, connection time, etc.). It also records user interactions – clicks, scrolls, form entries, etc. – but *not* personally identifiable information unless explicitly permitted.  Captured data is stored as a “Webpage Interaction Session” (WIS).

2.  **WIS Storage:**  A distributed, time-series database optimized for storing and querying WIS data.  WIS data is indexed by:
    *   User ID (hashed/anonymized).
    *   URL.
    *   Timestamp (granularity: milliseconds).
    *   Request/Response Headers.
    *   Content Hash (for de-duplication).

3.  **Temporal Reconstruction Engine:**  A server-side component that takes a URL, a user ID (or anonymized identifier), and a target timestamp as input. It reconstructs the webpage as it would have appeared to that user at that time. Steps:
    *   Retrieve the WIS data for the specified URL, user, and timestamp.
    *   Replay the network requests in the order they occurred, using the captured timing information.  This may involve caching responses or simulating network latency.
    *   Apply any user interactions that occurred before the target timestamp.
    *   Render the reconstructed webpage using a headless browser.

4.  **API Endpoint:** Expose an API endpoint that accepts a URL, user ID, timestamp, and optional rendering parameters (e.g., viewport size). The API returns a rendered image or HTML of the reconstructed webpage.

**Pseudocode (Temporal Reconstruction Engine):**

```
function reconstructWebpage(url, userId, timestamp, renderingParams):
  // 1. Retrieve WIS data
  wisData = getWisData(url, userId, timestamp)

  // 2. Initialize browser and network conditions
  browser = createHeadlessBrowser(renderingParams)
  setNetworkConditions(wisData.networkConditions) // Simulate latency, bandwidth

  // 3. Replay network requests
  for each request in wisData.requests:
    response = sendRequest(request.url, request.headers)
    injectResponseIntoBrowser(browser, response)

  // 4. Apply user interactions
  for each interaction in wisData.interactions:
    executeInteraction(browser, interaction) // Simulate clicks, scrolls

  // 5. Render the page
  renderedImage = browser.takeScreenshot()
  //OR
  renderedHTML = browser.getPageSource()

  return renderedImage //or renderedHTML
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Web Archiving:** Beyond static snapshots, provide a truly interactive historical web experience.
*   **Debugging:** Recreate the exact web environment a user experienced when reporting a bug.
*   **A/B Testing Analysis:**  Reconstruct the webpage a user saw during an A/B test to understand their behavior.
*   **Content Integrity Verification:**  Detect changes to a webpage over time.
*   **Personalized Web Experience:** Reconstruct the web page as it existed during a user's previous session.
