## Haptic Texture Synthesis via Force-Differential Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the force-sensitive input to *synthesize* textures on the display, not just *detect* pressure. This moves beyond simple force-as-command and towards simulating material properties.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires a high-resolution force-sensitive touch screen capable of discerning subtle force differences *and* localized vibration/actuation. The screen must also support variable opacity/translucency at a pixel level.
*   **Software – Texture Library:** A library of pre-defined texture profiles. Each profile contains:
    *   **Force-Mapping Function:** A function that maps visual pixel data to a corresponding force/vibration profile. This is a multi-dimensional map relating visual texture features (e.g., roughness, frequency, contrast) to force magnitude and vibration frequency/amplitude.
    *   **Opacity Mapping:**  A function controlling pixel opacity based on force/vibration levels. This is to simulate translucency or density.
    *   **Material Parameter Set:** Defines the perceived "feel" of the material – roughness, stickiness, hardness, elasticity.
*   **Software – Real-time Texture Synthesis Engine:**
    *   Input: Visual image data.
    *   Process:
        1.  **Feature Extraction:** Analyze the visual image data to identify texture features (e.g., edges, gradients, patterns).
        2.  **Texture Profile Selection:** Select the appropriate texture profile from the library based on the visual image characteristics.  A machine learning model (trained on human perception data) would assist in this selection.
        3.  **Force/Vibration Mapping:** Apply the selected profile’s Force-Mapping Function to determine the force/vibration level for each pixel.
        4.  **Opacity Adjustment:** Adjust pixel opacity based on the selected profile’s Opacity Mapping.
        5.  **Output:**  Send force/vibration instructions and opacity levels to the display.
*   **Pseudocode – Texture Synthesis Engine:**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION SynthesizeTexture(image_data)
  texture_profile = SelectTextureProfile(image_data) //ML assisted selection
  FOR each pixel IN image_data
    texture_features = ExtractFeatures(pixel)
    force_level = texture_profile.ForceMappingFunction(texture_features)
    opacity_level = texture_profile.OpacityMapping(texture_features)
    SendForceVibration(pixel.location, force_level)
    SetPixelOpacity(pixel.location, opacity_level)
  END FOR
END FUNCTION
```

*   **Example Texture Profiles:**
    *   **Sandpaper:** High frequency, high force, low opacity.  Force is modulated rapidly to simulate grit.
    *   **Silk:** Low frequency, low force, high opacity.  Force is smooth and consistent.
    *   **Bumpy Rubber:** Medium frequency, medium force, medium opacity. Force is patterned.
    *   **Water:** Low force, very high opacity, slight vibration to simulate ripples.

*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   **Dynamic Texture Synthesis:**  Real-time adaptation of texture profiles based on user interaction (e.g., swiping across a surface to create the illusion of friction).
    *   **Procedural Texture Generation:**  Create entirely new textures algorithmically, based on user-defined parameters.
    *   **Haptic Illusions:**  Use force and vibration to create illusions of texture where none physically exists (e.g., making a smooth surface *feel* rough).
