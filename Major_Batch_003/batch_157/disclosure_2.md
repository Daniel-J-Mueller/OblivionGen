## Dynamic Icon Morphing Based on User Emotional State

**Concept:** The display panel dynamically alters the appearance of icons based on real-time analysis of the user's emotional state, detected through webcam and/or biometric sensors. This goes beyond simple color changes; icons *morph* in shape, texture, and animation style to reflect the user’s feelings.

**Specifications:**

*   **Input:** Real-time emotional state data. Sources:
    *   Webcam-based facial expression analysis (using pre-trained AI models for emotion detection: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, neutral).
    *   Biometric data (optional): Heart rate variability (HRV) via wearable device (smartwatch/fitness tracker), skin conductance. Data should be normalized and weighted relative to baseline.
*   **Icon Database:** A comprehensive library of icon variations, categorized by emotion and icon type. Each base icon has multiple ‘morph’ targets – pre-defined 3D shapes/textures representing emotional states. Think of it like a blendshape system in animation.
*   **Morphing Algorithm:**
    1.  **Emotion Classification:** AI model outputs a probability distribution across defined emotions.
    2.  **Weighted Blend:** Emotions with higher probabilities contribute more to the final icon shape. Example: 70% happiness, 20% surprise, 10% neutral.
    3.  **Morph Target Selection:** For each icon on screen:
        *   Determine the dominant emotion(s) contributing to the blend.
        *   Select the corresponding morph targets from the icon database.
    4.  **Real-time Morphing:** Apply a weighted blend of morph targets to the base icon in real-time, creating a dynamic visual representation of the user’s emotional state.  The blend weights will be derived from the emotional state data.
*   **Icon Categories:**
    *   **System Icons:** (Volume, Wi-Fi, Battery) – Subtle morphs; emphasis on texture and color shifts.
    *   **Application Icons:** (Email, Browser, Word Processor) – More pronounced morphs; shapes can subtly alter to reflect the emotional state. For example, a calendar icon might 'bloom' with happiness or 'droop' with sadness.
    *   **Interactive Icons:** (Buttons, Sliders) – Morphing affects the interaction affordance. A button might “pulse” with excitement or “flatten” with frustration.
*   **Animation Style Control:**
    *   **Eases:**  Animation eases should be linked to emotion (e.g., bouncy eases for happiness, slow eases for sadness).
    *   **Particle Effects:** Brief particle effects (e.g., sparkles, wisps) can be triggered by strong emotional changes.
*   **User Customization:**
    *   **Sensitivity Adjustment:** Users can adjust the sensitivity of the morphing effect.
    *   **Emotion Mapping:** Users can customize which emotions trigger which morphs for specific icons.
    *   **Disable/Enable:** Global toggle to enable/disable the effect.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: emotionProbabilities (array of floats, representing probabilities for each emotion)
//        iconData (object containing base icon geometry and morph target data)

function morphIcon(emotionProbabilities, iconData) {
  // Calculate weighted morph target blend weights
  blendWeights = calculateBlendWeights(emotionProbabilities);

  // Apply blend weights to icon geometry
  morphedGeometry = applyBlendWeights(iconData.baseGeometry, blendWeights);

  // Return morphed geometry
  return morphedGeometry;
}

function calculateBlendWeights(emotionProbabilities) {
  // Define emotion-to-morph-target mapping
  emotionMap = {
    "happiness": "happyMorph",
    "sadness": "sadMorph",
    "anger": "angryMorph",
    "fear": "fearMorph",
    "surprise": "surpriseMorph",
    "neutral": "neutralMorph"
  };

  blendWeights = {};
  for (emotion in emotionProbabilities) {
    if (emotionProbabilities[emotion] > 0) {
      blendWeights[emotionMap[emotion]] = emotionProbabilities[emotion];
    }
  }

  return blendWeights;
}

function applyBlendWeights(baseGeometry, blendWeights) {
  // Iterate over morph targets
  for (morphTarget in blendWeights) {
    // Apply weight to morph target geometry
    morphedGeometry = blendGeometry(baseGeometry, morphTarget, blendWeights[morphTarget]);
  }

  return morphedGeometry;
}
