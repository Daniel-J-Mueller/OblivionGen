## Dynamic Sponsorship 'Mood' Adjustment

**Concept:** The system doesn't just display sponsorships *when* interest is high, but adjusts the *style* and *content* of the sponsorship based on a derived ‘mood’ of the user during media consumption. This moves beyond simple targeting to *reactive* sponsorship.

**Specs:**

1.  **Mood Derivation Module:**
    *   **Input:** Raw video/audio feed from the media item being consumed. User interaction data (pauses, rewinds, fast-forwards, volume changes, scrubbing). Playback speed. Device motion data (accelerometer, gyroscope – if available).
    *   **Processing:** Employ a lightweight, real-time emotion/affect recognition AI (pre-trained on a large dataset of facial expressions, vocal tones, and behavioral patterns).  This AI doesn't need to be perfectly accurate, but should provide a probabilistic assessment of the user's emotional state (e.g., happy, sad, frustrated, engaged, bored) and intensity.
    *   **Output:** A mood vector representing the user's current emotional state. Example: `[Happy: 0.8, Bored: 0.1, Frustrated: 0.05, Engaged: 0.05]`

2.  **Sponsorship Asset Library:**
    *   A database of sponsorship assets categorized by emotional 'tone'. Categories: Uplifting, Calming, Energetic, Humorous, Thought-Provoking, Neutral. Each asset should have multiple variations in length (short, medium, long) and format (video, image, interactive).
    *   Metadata tagging: Each asset tagged with associated keywords, ideal mood pairings, and avoidance triggers (e.g., ‘avoid during stressful content’).

3.  **Dynamic Sponsorship Selection Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Mood Vector, Current Content Category (e.g., comedy, drama, news), User Profile Data (interests, demographics).
    *   **Processing:**
        1.  Calculate a weighted emotional profile based on the mood vector, content category, and user profile.
        2.  Query the Sponsorship Asset Library for assets that best match the emotional profile. Prioritize assets with high emotional resonance and minimal avoidance triggers.
        3.  Select an asset of appropriate length and format based on the current sponsorship opportunity.
    *   **Output:** Selected Sponsorship Asset.

4.  **Presentation Layer:**
    *   Seamless integration with the existing media playback system.
    *   Dynamic asset loading and rendering.
    *   Optional:  Subtle visual/audio cues to indicate the sponsorship is adapting to the user’s mood (e.g., a slight color shift, a gentle sound effect).
    *   The 'returning content indicator' from the provided patent is retained, but its visual style adapts to the selected sponsorship's tone.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function selectSponsorship(moodVector, contentCategory, userProfile) {
  emotionalProfile = calculateEmotionalProfile(moodVector, contentCategory, userProfile)
  candidateAssets = queryAssetLibrary(emotionalProfile)
  // Apply filtering based on user preferences/history
  filteredAssets = filterAssets(candidateAssets, userProfile)

  // Select best asset based on matching score
  bestAsset = selectBestAsset(filteredAssets)

  return bestAsset
}

function calculateEmotionalProfile(moodVector, contentCategory, userProfile) {
  // Weight moodVector, contentCategory, and userProfile based on their relative importance
  //  (e.g., moodVector weight = 0.6, contentCategory weight = 0.3, userProfile weight = 0.1)
  // Combine the weighted values to create a single emotional profile vector
  // (e.g., [Happy: 0.4, Sad: 0.1, Angry: 0.05, Calm: 0.45])
  return emotionalProfile
}
```

**Potential Benefits:** Increased sponsorship effectiveness, enhanced user experience, more granular targeting, ability to create ‘mood-aware’ brand associations.
