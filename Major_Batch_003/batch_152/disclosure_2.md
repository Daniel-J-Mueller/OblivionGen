## Dynamic Compression Granularity with Per-Layer Adaptation

**Concept:** The patent focuses on compressing data *before* it reaches the processing array. This design extends that by making the compression *granularity* dynamic and adapting it *per layer* within a neural network. Instead of applying a single compression scheme uniformly, the system profiles data characteristics at each layer and chooses a compression granularity (e.g., individual weights, weight blocks, entire feature maps) that maximizes compression *without* exceeding a pre-defined accuracy threshold.

**Specs:**

*   **Profiling Module:** Integrated into the training or fine-tuning pipeline. It monitors the distribution of weights/activations at each layer. Key metrics: entropy, sparsity, dynamic range.
*   **Granularity Selection Algorithm:** Based on profiling data, this algorithm determines the optimal compression granularity for each layer. Could be a simple rule-based system (e.g., high entropy -> fine-grained compression, low entropy -> coarse-grained) or a learned model (e.g., a small neural network trained to predict optimal granularity).
*   **Adaptive Compression:** Implements various compression schemes (e.g., Asymmetric Numeral Systems, pruning, quantization) at the chosen granularity.
*   **Accuracy Monitoring:** During training, constantly monitors the impact of compression on the model's accuracy. Adjusts compression granularity or scheme if accuracy drops below the threshold.
*   **Metadata Storage:** Stores compression metadata (granularity, scheme, parameters) alongside the compressed data.
*   **Runtime Decompression/Reconstruction:** Processing array equipped with instructions to reconstruct data at the appropriate granularity based on the metadata.

**Pseudocode (Profiling & Granularity Selection):**

```
// Per-Layer Profiling
FOR each layer in model:
    Calculate entropy(weights)
    Calculate sparsity(weights)
    Calculate dynamic_range(weights)

// Granularity Selection
IF entropy(weights) > high_entropy_threshold AND sparsity(weights) < sparsity_threshold:
    granularity = "individual_weights"
    compression_scheme = "ANS"
ELSE IF entropy(weights) < low_entropy_threshold:
    granularity = "feature_map"
    compression_scheme = "quantization"
ELSE:
    granularity = "weight_block"
    compression_scheme = "pruning"

//Store granularity & compression scheme for layer
```

**Hardware Implications:**

*   **Flexible Processing Elements:** Processing array needs to be capable of handling compressed data at varying granularities. Requires adaptable decompression/reconstruction logic.
*   **Metadata Memory:** Dedicated memory for storing compression metadata. Needs to be fast and accessible.
*   **Profiling Accelerator:** Dedicated hardware for accelerating the profiling process.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Compression Ratios:** Adapting compression granularity to data characteristics can achieve higher compression ratios compared to uniform compression.
*   **Reduced Memory Footprint:** Significant reduction in memory bandwidth and storage requirements.
*   **Enhanced Energy Efficiency:** Reduced data movement and processing requirements translate to lower energy consumption.
*   **Dynamic Adaptability:**  The system can dynamically adapt to changing data distributions during runtime.
