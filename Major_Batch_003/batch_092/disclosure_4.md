## Dynamic Task Weighting via User State Embedding

**Concept:** The patent focuses on a multi-task prediction model for content ranking. This inspires a system where task weighting isn’t static, but dynamically adjusted based on a real-time embedding of the user’s *cognitive state*. Essentially, understanding *how* a user is currently thinking influences which tasks are prioritized in the prediction model.

**Specs:**

1.  **User State Sensor Integration:**
    *   Hardware: Integrate data streams from wearable sensors (EEG, GSR, heart rate variability, eye-tracking). Potentially incorporate data from device usage patterns (typing speed, app switching frequency, time spent on content).
    *   Software: Develop a sensor fusion module to combine these heterogeneous data sources into a unified "Cognitive State Vector."
2.  **Cognitive State Embedding Model:**
    *   Architecture: Utilize a recurrent neural network (LSTM or GRU) to model the temporal evolution of the Cognitive State Vector.
    *   Training: Train the model on a large dataset of user sensor data paired with explicit user feedback (e.g., ratings, clicks, dwell time) and implicit signals (e.g., scrolling behavior).
    *   Output: A low-dimensional embedding representing the user’s current cognitive state (e.g., focused, distracted, curious, bored).
3.  **Dynamic Task Weighting Layer:**
    *   Input: User State Embedding, Task Prediction Scores (from the existing patent’s separate layers).
    *   Mechanism: Implement a learned attention mechanism. The User State Embedding acts as the query, and the Task Prediction Scores are the key/value pairs. This attention mechanism produces weights for each task, indicating its relevance given the user's current cognitive state.
    *   Output: Weighted Task Prediction Scores.
4.  **Integration with Existing Model:**
    *   The Weighted Task Prediction Scores are then fed into the final ranking layer of the existing multi-task prediction model, replacing the unweighted scores.
5.  **Real-time Adaptation:**
    *   The entire process operates in real-time. The User State Embedding is updated continuously, causing the task weights to adapt dynamically to the user’s changing cognitive state.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Input: User Sensor Data Stream
# Output: Ranked Content Items

def rank_content(content_items, user_sensor_data):

  # 1. Cognitive State Embedding
  user_state_embedding = cognitive_state_model.predict(user_sensor_data)

  # 2. Task Prediction (from existing model)
  task_prediction_scores = existing_model.predict(content_items) # e.g., [score_task1, score_task2, ...]

  # 3. Dynamic Task Weighting
  task_weights = attention_mechanism(user_state_embedding, task_prediction_scores) # Output: [weight_task1, weight_task2, ...]

  # 4. Weighted Task Scores
  weighted_scores = [score * weight for score, weight in zip(task_prediction_scores, task_weights)]

  # 5. Final Ranking
  ranked_content = rank_by_score(content_items, weighted_scores)

  return ranked_content
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Personalized learning: Adjust content difficulty and format based on the user’s focus and understanding.
*   Adaptive advertising: Present ads that are relevant to the user’s current mood and mental state.
*   Enhanced content discovery: Recommend content that aligns with the user’s cognitive preferences.
*   Mental wellness applications: Provide targeted interventions based on the user’s emotional state.
