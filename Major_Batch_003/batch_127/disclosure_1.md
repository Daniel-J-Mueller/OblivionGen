## Dynamic Tensor Partitioning for Sparse Activation Exploitation

**Specification:** A system for dynamically partitioning input tensors based on real-time sparsity detection, coupled with a reconfigurable interconnect for efficient data delivery to compute subarrays.

**Motivation:** The provided patent focuses on optimizing convolution for dense tensors, and leveraging contiguous memory access. However, many modern neural networks employ sparsity – a significant percentage of activations are zero. This design aims to *exploit* that sparsity, reducing data movement and computational load.

**System Components:**

1.  **Sparsity Profiler:** A dedicated hardware module preceding the tensor processor. This module analyzes incoming activation tensors *on-the-fly* to identify regions of high sparsity (e.g., blocks of nearly-zero values). The profiler doesn’t require full tensor traversal; it operates on strategically sampled sub-tensors to estimate overall sparsity distribution.
2.  **Dynamic Partitioning Engine:** Based on the sparsity profile, this engine divides the input tensor into variable-sized partitions. High-sparsity regions are partitioned into smaller blocks, while dense regions remain larger. The partitioning is *not* static; it adapts to each incoming tensor.
3.  **Reconfigurable Interconnect:**  A network-on-chip (NoC) or similar interconnect structure that can dynamically route data between the partitioning engine, memory, and compute subarrays. The key feature is that the interconnect can bypass compute subarrays if a partition is predominantly sparse.
4.  **Compute Subarray Configuration:** The compute subarrays remain largely similar to those described in the reference patent. However, they receive instructions alongside the data indicating which portions of the input are active and which should be ignored. They have the capability to execute calculations on *only* the non-zero elements.
5.  **Memory Controller with Sparse Encoding:** The memory controller supports compressed sparse row (CSR) or similar sparse matrix formats, further reducing memory bandwidth requirements.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// On Receiving Input Tensor
sparsity_profile = SparsityProfiler.Analyze(input_tensor)
partitions = DynamicPartitioningEngine.CreatePartitions(input_tensor, sparsity_profile)

For Each partition In partitions:
  If Sparsity(partition) > threshold:
    // Route partition to memory with sparse encoding
    MemoryController.WriteSparse(partition)
    // Notify compute subarrays to skip this partition
    ComputeSubarray.SkipPartition(partition)
  Else:
    // Route partition to compute subarrays
    ComputeSubarray.ProcessPartition(partition)
```

**Detailed Specifications:**

*   **Sparsity Profiler:** Sampling rate adjustable via software. Supports multiple sparsity metrics (e.g., percentage of zeros, L1 norm of activations). Uses dedicated hardware for fast, parallel calculation of sparsity metrics.
*   **Dynamic Partitioning Engine:** Partitioning granularity configurable via software. Algorithms: k-means clustering, quadtree decomposition, or greedy partitioning based on sparsity criteria.
*   **Reconfigurable Interconnect:**  Based on a crossbar switch or a mesh network. Supports multiple simultaneous data streams. Dynamically adjusts bandwidth allocation based on partition size and sparsity.
*   **Compute Subarray Configuration:** Hardware support for masking out zero elements. Instructions to the subarrays specify the starting address and size of active data within each partition.
*   **Memory Controller:** Supports CSR, CSC, or other sparse matrix formats. Hardware acceleration for sparse matrix compression and decompression.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significant reduction in data movement for sparse tensors.
*   Reduced computational load by skipping unnecessary calculations.
*   Improved energy efficiency.
*   Increased throughput for sparse neural networks.

**Novelty:** The combination of dynamic partitioning, reconfigurable interconnect, and sparse memory encoding provides a uniquely adaptive system for exploiting sparsity in tensor processing, going beyond static optimizations. The system adapts to *each* tensor, maximizing efficiency and performance.
