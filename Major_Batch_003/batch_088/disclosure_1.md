**Personalized Debate Simulation & Skill Assessment**

**Concept:** Extend the messaging system to facilitate structured debates between users with opposing viewpoints, incorporating real-time feedback on debate skills.

**Specifications:**

*   **Debate Topic Selection:** System offers curated debate topics *beyond* initial viewpoint elicitation. Topics are categorized (politics, ethics, science) & difficulty-rated. Users can also suggest topics.
*   **Role Assignment:**  System randomly assigns ‘pro’ or ‘con’ role *after* topic selection, ensuring balanced exposure.
*   **Timed Rounds:** Debate unfolds in timed rounds (e.g., 2-minute opening statement, 3-minute rebuttal, 1-minute closing).  Timers are visibly displayed to both participants.
*   **AI-Powered Skill Assessment:**  During debate, AI analyzes message content for:
    *   **Logical Fallacies:** Detects common fallacies (ad hominem, straw man, false dichotomy) & provides immediate feedback to both participants (“Possible fallacy detected: Consider if your argument relies on attacking the person rather than the argument itself”).
    *   **Evidence Support:** Flags claims lacking supporting evidence (“Consider providing data or sources to strengthen your claim”).
    *   **Respectful Tone:**  Monitors language for incivility/personal attacks (“Consider rephrasing to maintain a respectful tone”).  Gentle warnings issued, excessive incivility leads to temporary message blocking.
    *   **Clarity & Conciseness:** Assesses sentence structure & vocabulary complexity.
*   **Post-Debate Analytics:**  Users receive a personalized report detailing:
    *   **Skill Score:** Composite score reflecting performance across all assessed areas.
    *   **Strengths & Weaknesses:** Identifies areas of proficiency and areas needing improvement.
    *   **Transcript Review:**  Annotated transcript highlighting instances of fallacies, unsupported claims, or uncivil language.
*   **Debate ‘League’ System:**  Users earn points based on debate performance and climb a leaderboard, fostering friendly competition.
*   **'Observer' Mode:** Allows other users to watch debates (with participant consent) and provide constructive feedback.
*   **Difficulty Scaling:** System adjusts debate topic complexity and AI scrutiny based on user skill level.
*   **Moderation Tools:** Human moderators can review flagged debates and provide additional feedback or intervene if necessary.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Debate Loop
While (debate_in_progress) {
    current_round = get_next_round();
    display_round_timer(current_round.duration);

    user_message = get_user_message();
    ai_analysis_result = analyze_message(user_message);

    display_ai_feedback(ai_analysis_result); //Non blocking

    If (round_timer_expired()){
        end_round();
    }

    If (debate_criteria_met()){
        end_debate();
    }
}

// Analyze Message Function
function analyze_message(message){
    fallacy_detection_result = detect_fallacies(message);
    evidence_support_result = assess_evidence(message);
    tone_analysis_result = analyze_tone(message);
    return {fallacies: fallacy_detection_result, evidence: evidence_support_result, tone: tone_analysis_result};
}

// Post Debate Analytics
function generate_analytics_report(debate_transcript, ai_analysis_results){
  //Calculate scores based on the results.
  //Generate insights based on identified weaknesses
  //Create a visualized report
  return report
}
