## Adaptive Notification Sculpting with Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** Extend the multimodal notification system to incorporate real-time biometric data from the user, dynamically 'sculpting' the notification’s presentation – not just *how* it’s delivered (visual/auditory) but *the form* of the delivery itself. Think beyond intensity; think shape, texture (via haptics), and even subtle olfactory cues.

**Specs:**

*   **Biometric Sensor Suite:** Expand compatible client devices to include robust biometric sensors: heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA - skin conductance), and potentially even facial muscle tension (via micro-sensors in AR/VR headsets or embedded in smart glasses).  These will be baseline metrics.
*   **Biometric Baseline Establishment:** System performs a continuous learning phase to establish personalized biometric baselines for the user during various activity states (focused work, relaxed leisure, during conversation, etc.).  This is crucial for accurate anomaly detection.
*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:**  An AI-driven engine monitors real-time biometric data, identifying deviations from established baselines indicating stress, cognitive load, emotional state, or heightened attention.  Thresholds are individualized and adaptive.
*   **Notification ‘Primitives’:** Define a library of basic notification ‘primitives’ – visual shapes, audio waveforms, haptic patterns, and even micro-olfactory emissions (if supported by hardware). Each primitive corresponds to a specific emotional or cognitive state.  Examples:
    *   *Calming Visual*: Slow-moving, rounded shapes with cool colors.
    *   *Urgent Audio*: Short, sharp, ascending tones.
    *   *Focus-Enhancing Haptics*:  Subtle, rhythmic vibrations on the wrist.
    *   *Relaxation Olfactory*: Lavender or chamomile scent.
*   **Dynamic Notification Composition:** When a notification arrives, the system *composes* a notification presentation based on:
    1.  The notification’s priority level (from the original patent).
    2.  The current filter level.
    3.  The user’s real-time biometric state.
    4.  A pre-defined ‘emotional mapping’ – linking priority levels and biometric states to appropriate primitive combinations.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION ComposeNotification(priority, filter, biometricData):
  // 1. Determine Base Delivery Level (from original patent)
  deliveryLevel = DetermineDeliveryLevel(priority, filter)

  // 2. Analyze Biometric Data
  stressLevel = AnalyzeStress(biometricData)
  attentionLevel = AnalyzeAttention(biometricData)

  // 3. Select Primitives
  IF stressLevel > threshold:
    visualPrimitive = CalmingVisual
    audioPrimitive = SoothingTone
    hapticPrimitive = GentlePulse
  ELSE IF attentionLevel < threshold:
    visualPrimitive = HighContrastAlert
    audioPrimitive = SharpBeep
    hapticPrimitive = FirmTap
  ELSE:
    visualPrimitive = DefaultVisual
    audioPrimitive = DefaultAudio
    hapticPrimitive = DefaultHaptic

  // 4. Compose Notification
  notification = CombinePrimitives(visualPrimitive, audioPrimitive, hapticPrimitive, deliveryLevel)

  RETURN notification
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   AR/VR Headsets with integrated biometric sensors and micro-olfactory emitters.
*   Smartwatches with enhanced EDA sensors and haptic feedback capabilities.
*   Smart Glasses with eye-tracking and micro-sensors for facial muscle tension.
*   Client devices capable of outputting the aforementioned stimuli.
