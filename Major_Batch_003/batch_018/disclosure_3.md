## Dynamic Entity Contextualization - "Thread-Worlds"

**Concept:** Extend the "entity card" concept beyond simple information display and communication controls to create temporary, immersive “thread-worlds” accessible directly within the messaging interface. These are small, interactive environments tailored to the entity being referenced, offering richer context and facilitating more nuanced interaction.

**Specs:**

*   **Trigger:** User long-press/force-touch/hover on an entity reference within a message thread. (Configurable within app settings.)
*   **World Generation:**
    *   Entity Type Detection: System identifies the entity type (Person, Place, Event, Product, Concept, etc.).
    *   Procedural Generation: Based on entity type and available data, a minimal, contextually relevant 3D/2D environment is generated.
        *   People:  A minimalist representation of the person’s ‘digital space’ – recent shared photos, common interest tags visualized as objects, a simplified activity feed.
        *   Places: A stylized map snippet with points of interest (restaurants, landmarks), real-time weather, and quick access to directions.
        *   Events: A visual timeline of event details, attendee list (with quick profile access), and a shared media gallery.
        *   Products: A rotating 3D model with key specifications, user reviews (highlighted keywords), and purchase options.
        *   Concepts:  A dynamic graph visualization linking the concept to related terms, articles, and experts.
*   **Interaction Layer:**
    *   Direct Manipulation: Users can interact with elements within the "thread-world" – zoom, rotate, select, and reveal deeper information.
    *   Shared Annotations:  Multiple users in the thread can collaboratively annotate the "thread-world" with drawings, notes, and virtual objects. These annotations are visible to all participants.
    *   Quick Actions: Predefined actions relevant to the entity are accessible directly within the "thread-world" (e.g., “Call”, “Email”, “Schedule Meeting”, “Add to Calendar”, “Start Video Chat”).
*   **Overlay & Integration:**
    *   Non-Disruptive Overlay: "Thread-Worlds" appear as a semi-transparent overlay on top of the message thread, allowing users to maintain context while exploring the immersive environment.
    *   Seamless Transition:  Users can easily switch between the message thread and the "Thread-World" with a simple gesture or button press.
    *   Multi-Platform Support: "Thread-Worlds" are rendered using a cross-platform rendering engine (e.g., WebGL, Metal, Vulkan) to ensure compatibility across devices.
*   **API & Extensibility:**
    *   Developer API: A public API allows third-party developers to create custom "Thread-World" environments for their own entities and applications.
    *   Content Integration:  Integration with external data sources (e.g., knowledge graphs, databases, APIs) to enrich "Thread-World" content.

**Pseudocode (Simplified World Generation):**

```
function generateThreadWorld(entity, entityType) {
  world = new World();

  switch (entityType) {
    case "Person":
      world.addElements(getRecentPhotos(entity), getCommonInterests(entity));
      world.setEnvironment("minimalist digital space");
      break;
    case "Place":
      world.addElements(getMapSnippet(entity), getWeatherInfo(entity));
      world.setEnvironment("stylized map");
      break;
    case "Event":
      world.addElements(getEventTimeline(entity), getAttendeeList(entity));
      world.setEnvironment("event stage");
      break;
    default:
      world.setEnvironment("generic 3D space");
  }

  return world;
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **AR Integration:**  Project "Thread-Worlds" onto the real world using augmented reality.
*   **AI-Powered World Generation:**  Use AI to automatically generate more complex and personalized "Thread-World" environments.
*   **Multiplayer Worlds:** Allow multiple users to interact within the same "Thread-World" in real-time.
