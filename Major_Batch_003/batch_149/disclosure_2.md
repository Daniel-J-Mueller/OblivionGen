## Dynamic Spectral Shaping with AI-Driven Interference Prediction

**Concept:** Leverage the CFR/PC principles to *proactively* shape the transmitted spectrum, not just cancel peaks, by predicting and nulling potential interference *before* it manifests. This moves beyond reactive cancellation towards predictive spectral control.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Interference Prediction Engine (IPE):** A machine learning model (likely a recurrent neural network or transformer) trained on historical and real-time spectral data from the operating environment. Input features: received signal strength indicators (RSSI), channel state information (CSI), geographic location, time of day, and known interference sources. Output: a probability map of potential interference frequencies and amplitudes.
*   **Spectral Shaping Module (SSM):** The core of the innovation. Takes the interference probability map from the IPE and generates a dynamic “spectral mask”. This mask dictates the precise shape of the PC signal, going beyond simple peak cancellation.
*   **PC Signal Generator (Enhanced):** Modified from the patent's PC signal generator. Now capable of generating *arbitrarily shaped* PC signals defined by the spectral mask. This requires a more flexible sinc/window function implementation, perhaps based on frequency domain synthesis.
*   **Adaptive Bandwidth/Center Frequency Controller:** Continues the function of the patent, but now driven by the SSM. The bandwidth and center frequency of the PC signal are dynamically adjusted to optimally conform to the spectral mask.
*   **Feedback Loop:** EVM measurements from the receiver are fed back to the IPE and SSM, allowing the system to learn and improve its interference prediction and spectral shaping capabilities.

**2. Algorithm/Pseudocode:**

```
// Interference Prediction Engine (IPE) - Simplified
function predictInterference(historicalData, realTimeData) {
  // Train ML model on historicalData
  // Input: realTimeData (RSSI, CSI, location, time)
  // Output: interferenceProbabilityMap (frequency -> probability)
}

// Spectral Shaping Module (SSM)
function generateSpectralMask(interferenceProbabilityMap) {
  // Convert probability map into a spectral mask 
  // (frequency -> attenuation level)
  // Attenuation levels dictate the shape of the PC signal
}

// PC Signal Generation
function generatePCSignal(spectralMask, carrierSignal) {
  // Frequency Domain Synthesis:
  // 1. FFT(carrierSignal)
  // 2. Apply spectralMask to FFT(carrierSignal)
  // 3. Inverse FFT to generate PC signal in time domain
}

// Main Loop:
while (true) {
  interferenceMap = predictInterference(historicalData, realTimeData);
  spectralMask = generateSpectralMask(interferenceMap);
  pcSignal = generatePCSignal(spectralMask, carrierSignal);
  transmittedSignal = carrierSignal - pcSignal;
  measureEVM(receivedSignal);
  updateHistoricalData(EVM, interferenceMap);
}
```

**3. Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance DSP or FPGA for real-time signal processing.
*   Sufficient memory to store historical data and ML models.
*   Wideband ADC/DAC for capturing and generating signals across the desired frequency range.
*   RF front-end with low noise figure and high linearity.
*   Connectivity for data acquisition and model updates.

**4. Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Interference Mitigation:** Shifts from reactive cancellation to proactive shaping of the transmitted spectrum.
*   **AI-Driven Spectral Control:** Leverages machine learning to predict and mitigate interference more effectively.
*   **Flexible PC Signal Generation:** Enables the generation of arbitrarily shaped PC signals to conform to complex spectral masks.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously improves performance through feedback and model updates.
