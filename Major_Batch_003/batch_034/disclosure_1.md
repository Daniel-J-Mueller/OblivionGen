## Delayed-Action Media Enrichment

**Concept:** Expand the delayed-action framework to encompass media enrichment â€“ automatically modifying or augmenting media content *before* it's delivered to the recipient, based on pre-defined rules and the delay period.

**Specs:**

*   **Media Enrichment Rules Engine:** A module capable of defining rules that dictate media modifications. These rules would be structured as: `IF [condition related to media type, content, sender, recipient, or delay period] THEN [modification action]`.  Example: `IF [media type == image AND sender == 'Boss'] THEN [apply sepia filter AND increase contrast]`.
*   **Media Modification Actions:**  A library of supported actions including:
    *   Image filtering (sepia, grayscale, contrast adjustment, blur)
    *   Video trimming/looping
    *   Audio ducking/boosting
    *   Text overlay/watermarking
    *   GIF creation from video snippets
    *   Meme generation (using template selection and text insertion)
*   **Delay-Action Queue Integration:**  Existing delay-action queues are extended to include a 'media enrichment flag' and enrichment rule set.  When a delayed message containing media is detected, the system retrieves the associated enrichment rules.
*   **Media Processing Module:**  A dedicated module responsible for executing media modifications. This module could leverage existing image/video/audio processing libraries.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:**  All media modifications are performed asynchronously to prevent blocking the main messaging flow.
*   **Preview/Testing:** A system for previewing media modifications before enabling them for live messaging.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION process_delayed_message(message):
  IF message.has_media():
    IF message.delay_action_flag():
      enrichment_rules = get_enrichment_rules(message.sender, message.recipient)
      IF enrichment_rules:
        media = message.media
        processed_media = apply_enrichment_rules(media, enrichment_rules)
        message.media = processed_media
      ELSE:
        // No enrichment rules, proceed without modification
    // Add message to appropriate delay-action queue based on delay time.

FUNCTION apply_enrichment_rules(media, rules):
    FOR each rule in rules:
        IF rule.condition(media):
            media = rule.action(media)
    RETURN media
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Professional Communication:**  Automatically add company branding to shared media.
*   **Personalized Experiences:**  Apply filters or effects based on recipient preferences.
*   **Automated Content Creation:**  Generate memes or short videos based on message content.
*   **Accessibility:**  Automatically add subtitles or audio descriptions to media.
*   **Ephemeral Branding**: Auto-generate short videos with branded watermarks which decay or disappear after a set time.
