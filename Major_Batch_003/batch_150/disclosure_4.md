**Dynamic Accelerator Firmware Composition**

**Concept:** Instead of authenticating and delivering pre-composed accelerator firmware, the system dynamically *composes* firmware on-the-fly from a library of verified, granular functional blocks. This enables highly customized acceleration tailored to specific workloads, dramatically reduces firmware size, and enhances security by minimizing the attack surface.

**Specs:**

*   **Functional Block Library:** A repository of pre-verified accelerator function blocks (e.g., cryptographic primitives, compression/decompression algorithms, data transformation functions). Blocks are signed and stored in immutable flash memory. Blocks will come in varying sizes/complexities.
*   **Workload Profiler:** A hardware/software component that analyzes incoming workloads to identify acceleration opportunities and determine the optimal set of functional blocks needed.
*   **Composition Engine:** A dedicated hardware unit responsible for assembling the selected functional blocks into a cohesive accelerator firmware image. This engine utilizes a specialized instruction set for linking blocks and resolving dependencies.
*   **Dynamic Linking & Dependency Resolution:** The Composition Engine must resolve dependencies between functional blocks, ensuring correct data flow and execution order. This is achieved through a metadata system associated with each block.
*   **Runtime Verification:** A lightweight runtime verification module to check the integrity of the composed firmware image before execution. This can involve hashing and comparing against expected values.
*   **Sideband Communication:**  A high-bandwidth sideband bus to deliver the dynamically composed firmware to the accelerator.
*   **Firmware Versioning:** All functional blocks and composed firmware images must be versioned to enable rollbacks and updates.

**Pseudocode (Composition Engine):**

```
function compose_firmware(workload_profile):
  // 1. Analyze workload profile to determine required acceleration functions
  required_functions = analyze_workload(workload_profile)

  // 2. Select compatible functional blocks from the library
  candidate_blocks = select_blocks(required_functions)

  // 3. Resolve dependencies and create execution graph
  execution_graph = resolve_dependencies(candidate_blocks)

  // 4. Link functional blocks based on execution graph
  composed_firmware = link_blocks(execution_graph)

  // 5. Verify integrity of composed firmware
  if verify_firmware(composed_firmware):
    return composed_firmware
  else:
    return error

function link_blocks(execution_graph):
  // Iterate through nodes in the graph
  for each node in execution_graph:
    // Fetch corresponding functional block
    block = fetch_block(node.id)
    // Connect input/output ports according to graph connections
    connect_ports(block, node.inputs, node.outputs)

  return assembled_firmware
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   Functional blocks must be rigorously vetted and signed by a trusted authority.
*   The Composition Engine itself must be secured against tampering.
*   Access to the functional block library should be strictly controlled.
*   Runtime verification should detect any unauthorized modifications to the composed firmware.
