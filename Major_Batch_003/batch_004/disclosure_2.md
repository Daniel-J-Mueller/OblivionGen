## Dynamic Ambient Information Projection

**Concept:** Extend the distance-based content adjustment to *project* relevant information onto the environment *around* the user, creating an augmented reality experience tailored to their proximity. Instead of solely altering the display *of* the device, the device leverages ambient projection to provide contextual information *in* the user's space.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Ultra-short throw projector integrated into the computing device (e.g., a tablet, smart speaker, or dedicated base station). Must be capable of projecting a clear image onto various surfaces (walls, floors, tables) even in ambient light.
    *   High-resolution depth sensor (LiDAR or structured light) for accurate environmental mapping and user tracking.
    *   Wide-angle camera for surface detection and image stabilization.
    *   Optional: Microphone array for voice command integration.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Environmental Mapping Module:** Scans the surrounding environment and creates a 3D mesh model. Identifies surfaces suitable for projection (flat walls, tables).
    *   **User Tracking Module:**  Uses depth sensor and camera data to continuously track the user's position and orientation in space.
    *   **Content Selection Module:** Based on user distance (as in the original patent) and *contextual awareness* (time of day, location, user profile, detected objects), selects appropriate content.  Content can include:
        *   **Proximity-Based Information:** If the user is near a kitchen counter, project a recipe display. Near a doorway, project weather information.
        *   **Interactive Elements:** Project a virtual keyboard or control panel onto a table.
        *   **Ambient Visuals:**  Project subtle, dynamic patterns or colors onto walls for mood setting.
        *   **Notifications:** Display notifications projected onto a nearby surface.
    *   **Projection Mapping Engine:** Warps and blends the selected content to seamlessly fit the detected surfaces. Dynamically adjusts projection based on user movement and surface irregularities.
    *   **Gesture Recognition Module:** Recognizes hand gestures to allow users to interact with projected content (e.g., swipe to change pages, tap to select options).
*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Passive Projection:**  Displays static or slowly changing information (e.g., ambient visuals, time and weather).
    *   **Interactive Projection:**  Allows users to interact with projected content using gestures or voice commands.
    *   **Contextual Projection:**  Dynamically adjusts projected content based on user location, activity, and surrounding environment.

**Pseudocode (Contextual Projection):**

```
// Main Loop
While (device is ON) {
  userDistance = GetUserDistance();
  environmentData = GetEnvironmentData(); // LiDAR/Camera data
  context = GetContext(); // Time, location, user profile, detected objects

  IF (userDistance > farThreshold) {
    DisplayAmbientVisuals(); // Subtle background projection
  } ELSE IF (userDistance > mediumThreshold) {
    DisplayContextualInfo(context); // Basic info like weather, news
  } ELSE {
    IF (context == "kitchen") {
      DisplayRecipe(userPreference);
    } ELSE IF (context == "living room") {
      DisplayEntertainmentOptions();
    } ELSE {
      DisplayInteractiveControls(); // Virtual keyboard, control panel
    }
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** This expands the concept beyond screen-based content alteration to create a fully immersive, ambient AR experience. It leverages projection mapping to turn the userâ€™s environment *into* the display, making information more accessible and engaging.  The interactive elements could redefine how people interact with their devices. It's a move from 'display enhancement' to 'environmental augmentation'.
