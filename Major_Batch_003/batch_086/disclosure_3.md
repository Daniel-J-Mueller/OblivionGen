## Adaptive Time Interval Granularity for Multi-Asset Behavioral Profiling

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity (length) of time intervals used in generating time series data *per asset type and per observed behavioral pattern*. This extends beyond fixed or globally adjusted intervals (as in the provided patent) to allow for highly nuanced tracking of asset behavior.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Behavioral Pattern Library:** A database cataloging expected or observed behavioral patterns for each asset type. Examples: "Rapid URL sharing by new accounts", "Consistent content interaction from established users", "Spike in IP address requests". Each pattern is linked to a suggested initial time interval range.
*   **Time Interval Adjustment Module:** This module monitors the incoming event stream and, based on the identified behavioral pattern and observed data characteristics, adjusts the time interval length. 
*   **Entropy Monitor:** Continuously calculates the Shannon entropy of event occurrences within each time interval. High entropy suggests a need for finer granularity (shorter intervals) to capture rapid changes. Low entropy suggests consolidation into larger intervals.
*   **Data Storage Layer:** Optimized for handling variable-length time series data.  Could employ a columnar database or a specialized time-series database.

**III. Operational Procedure (Pseudocode):**

```
// Initialization
FOR each asset_type IN asset_types:
    Initialize default time_interval_length based on Behavioral Pattern Library
    Initialize Entropy Monitor

// Event Processing Loop
ON event_received(event):
    asset = event.asset
    behavioral_pattern = identify_behavioral_pattern(asset, event) // Utilizes ML classification

    current_time_interval_length = get_current_time_interval_length(asset)

    // Adjust time interval length
    entropy = EntropyMonitor.calculate_entropy(asset, current_time_interval_length)

    IF entropy > threshold_high:
        decrease current_time_interval_length by factor
    ELSE IF entropy < threshold_low:
        increase current_time_interval_length by factor

    // Record event in time series using adjusted time interval
    record_event(event, current_time_interval_length)
```

**IV.  Data Structures:**

*   `AssetProfile`: Stores asset-specific data:
    *   `asset_type` (String)
    *   `current_time_interval_length` (Float)
    *   `behavioral_pattern` (String)
*   `TimeSeriesEntry`: Represents a single data point:
    *   `timestamp` (Timestamp)
    *   `asset_id` (String)
    *   `event_count` (Integer)

**V.  Advanced Considerations:**

*   **Hierarchical Time Intervals:** Employ a tree-like structure of time intervals, allowing for zoom-in/zoom-out analysis.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Dynamically adjust the `threshold_high` and `threshold_low` values based on overall system load and data variance.
*   **Predictive Adjustment:** Utilize machine learning models to *predict* optimal time interval lengths based on historical data and current trends.
* **Multi-Dimensional Time Series:**  Rather than a single count per interval, store a distribution of event *types* within each interval (e.g., clicks, shares, hides).
