## Dynamic Neuron Personality Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the visualization to create 'personality profiles' for each neuron, evolving over time based on data exposure. Instead of a static summary feature vector, maintain a running average and variance for each feature *per neuron*, representing the neuron’s ‘preference’ and ‘sensitivity’ to each input feature. This allows for identification of nuanced neuron behavior and potential concept drift.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Structures:**
    *   `NeuronProfile`:  A data structure associated with each neuron. Contains:
        *   `feature_averages`:  A vector of floats (length = number of input features). Holds the running average value for each feature, as observed by the neuron.
        *   `feature_variances`: A vector of floats (length = number of input features). Holds the running variance for each feature, representing sensitivity.
        *   `data_point_history`: A circular buffer storing the last *N* data points that strongly activated this neuron. This allows for inspection of recent examples.

2.  **Initialization:**
    *   Upon model loading, initialize each `NeuronProfile` with zero-filled `feature_averages` and `feature_variances`.

3.  **Real-time Update (During Inference/Training):**
    *   For each input data point *x* that activates neuron *n*:
        *   Update `feature_averages` using an online moving average:
            `feature_averages[i] = (1 - learning_rate) * feature_averages[i] + learning_rate * x[i]`
        *   Update `feature_variances[i] = (1 - learning_rate) * feature_variances[i] + learning_rate * (x[i] - feature_averages[i])^2`
        *   Add *x* to `data_point_history` (overwrite oldest entry if buffer is full).

4.  **Visualization Enhancement:**
    *   **Heatmaps:** Display heatmaps representing `feature_averages` for each neuron. Brighter/darker shades indicate stronger/weaker preference.
    *   **Variance Bars:**  Overlay bars representing `feature_variances`.  Taller bars indicate higher sensitivity to that feature.
    *   **Interactive History:** Allow users to select a neuron and view its `data_point_history` – displaying recent examples that strongly activated it.  This can be presented as a scrolling list or a small scatter plot.
    *   **Drift Detection:** Implement an algorithm to detect significant changes in `feature_averages` over time.  Flag neurons exhibiting drift, indicating potential concept drift.  Present drift as a color change in the heatmap.

5.  **User Interaction:**
    *   **Threshold Control:**  Allow users to adjust the activation threshold for adding data points to `data_point_history`.
    *   **Smoothing:** Implement smoothing algorithms (e.g., exponential moving average) for `feature_averages` to reduce noise.
    *   **Feature Selection:**  Allow users to select specific features to highlight in the heatmap and variance bars.



**Pseudocode (Update Function):**

```pseudocode
function update_neuron_profile(neuron, data_point, activation_value, learning_rate, activation_threshold):
  if activation_value > activation_threshold:
    for i in range(number_of_features):
      neuron.feature_averages[i] = (1 - learning_rate) * neuron.feature_averages[i] + learning_rate * data_point[i]
      neuron.feature_variances[i] = (1 - learning_rate) * neuron.feature_variances[i] + learning_rate * (data_point[i] - neuron.feature_averages[i])^2
    add_to_circular_buffer(neuron.data_point_history, data_point)
