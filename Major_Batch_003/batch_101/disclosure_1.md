**Dynamic Thread Personality Profiles**

**Specification:**

1.  **Core Concept:** Introduce "Thread Personalities" – configurable profiles that dynamically alter the visual and functional behavior of a group message thread based on administrator or user-defined settings. These go beyond simple cosmetic changes (colors, emojis) to impact how messages are *displayed* and *interacted with*.

2.  **Personality Archetypes (Initial Set):**
    *   **"Focus Mode":**  Hides all but the most recent message in the thread, minimizing distractions.  New messages expand the view.  Archived messages are accessible via a dedicated button.
    *   **"Debate Mode":**  Visually separates opposing viewpoints within the thread.  Requires initial tagging of participants or messages with "pro" or "con" (or custom tags).  Messages are displayed with distinct coloring/formatting based on the tag.
    *   **"Story Mode":**  Arranges messages in a visually narrative format, potentially utilizing image/video previews as primary display elements. Designed for sharing experiences or step-by-step guides.
    *   **"Zen Mode":**  Minimizes visual clutter.  Displays messages as simple text blocks with minimal formatting.  Disables notifications except for direct mentions.
    *   **"Gamified Mode":** Introduces elements of gamification – points, badges, leaderboards – based on message participation (e.g., most active contributor, most helpful response). Requires integration with a reputation system.

3.  **Configuration Interface:**
    *   Accessible via a settings panel within the thread.
    *   Allows administrators (and potentially users with permissions) to select a Thread Personality.
    *   Provides customization options specific to the selected personality (e.g., color schemes for Debate Mode, point values for Gamified Mode).
    *   Option to create custom personalities with user-defined rules and visual settings.

4.  **Implementation Details:**
    *   Utilize a rules engine to define the behavior of each personality.
    *   Employ dynamic UI rendering to adapt the message display based on the active personality.
    *   Store personality configurations on a per-thread basis.
    *   Consider a scripting language (e.g., Lua) to allow advanced customization and community-created personalities.

5.  **Pseudocode (Personality Activation):**

```
function activatePersonality(threadID, personalityName) {
  personalityConfig = getPersonalityConfig(personalityName);
  if (personalityConfig == null) {
    // Use default personality
    personalityConfig = getDefaultPersonalityConfig();
  }

  updateThreadUI(threadID, personalityConfig); // Apply UI changes
  applyRulesEngine(threadID, personalityConfig); // Activate rules
}

function updateThreadUI(threadID, config) {
  // Modify message display elements based on config
  // Example: change background color, font size, message formatting
}

function applyRulesEngine(threadID, config) {
  // Activate rules based on config
  // Example: hide certain messages, highlight specific users, re-order messages
}
```

6.  **Expansion Potential:**
    *   Integrate with external services to trigger actions based on thread content (e.g., create a task in a project management tool).
    *   Allow users to "subscribe" to specific Thread Personalities, automatically applying them to new threads they join.
    *   Create a marketplace for community-created Thread Personalities.
