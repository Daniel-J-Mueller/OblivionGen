## Adaptive Influence Modeling for Content Prioritization

**Concept:** Expand the cluster analysis beyond age and asserted characteristics to model *influence* within the social network, predicting content resonance based on propagation patterns and user roles. This moves beyond demographic clustering to behavioral and relational clustering.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Feature Engineering:**

1.  **Interaction Graph Construction:**  Create a weighted, directed graph representing user interactions.
    *   Nodes: Users.
    *   Edges:  Represent interactions (likes, shares, comments, direct messages, co-views).
    *   Weights: Reflect interaction frequency and recency (decaying over time).  More recent, frequent interactions have higher weights.  Different interaction *types* receive different scaling factors. (e.g. Share > Comment > Like)
2.  **Role Identification:** Employ graph algorithms (e.g., PageRank, Betweenness Centrality, Eigenvector Centrality) to identify user roles within the interaction graph.
    *   *Influencers:* High PageRank/Eigenvector Centrality – widely connected, content disseminators.
    *   *Connectors:* High Betweenness Centrality – bridge disparate communities.
    *   *Receivers:* Low centrality – primarily consume content.
3.  **Content Propagation Tracking:** For each piece of content, track its propagation path through the interaction graph. Record:
    *   Initial sharing user.
    *   Sequence of users who shared/liked/commented.
    *   Time elapsed between interactions.
    *   Community overlaps of interacting users (based on existing clusters or newly identified subgraphs).
4. **Characteristic Vector Creation:** For each user, create a vector including:
    * Asserted characteristics (age, location, interests).
    * Role identifiers (Influencer, Connector, Receiver – boolean flags or weighted scores).
    * Propagation tendencies (average propagation depth, average time to first share, number of unique communities reached).
    *  Content Affinity – A vector representing the types of content the user interacts with most frequently.  (e.g. [News: 0.7, Sports: 0.2, Entertainment: 0.1])

**II. Cluster Analysis & Modeling:**

1.  **Hybrid Clustering:** Combine the existing cluster analysis (based on asserted characteristics) with a new cluster analysis based on the characteristic vectors described above.  Employ a weighted combination of distance metrics.
    *   *Asserted Characteristic Distance:* Euclidean distance between asserted characteristics.
    *   *Behavioral Distance:* Cosine similarity between propagation tendency vectors and content affinity vectors.
    *   *Weighting Factor:*  Adjustable parameter to prioritize either demographic or behavioral similarity.
2.  **Dynamic Cluster Assignment:** Implement a system for dynamically assigning users to clusters based on their changing behavior.  Re-evaluate cluster membership at regular intervals (e.g., daily) or when significant behavioral changes are detected.
3.  **Influence Score Calculation:** For each cluster, calculate an “Influence Score” based on the average and distribution of Influence metrics among its members.

**III. Content Prioritization & Delivery:**

1.  **Content Resonance Prediction:** For a given content item, predict its resonance within each cluster based on:
    *   Cluster Influence Score.
    *   Content Affinity of the cluster (calculated from aggregated user data).
    *   Historical performance of similar content within the cluster.
2.  **Personalized Content Ranking:** When presenting content to a user, rank items based on a combined score incorporating:
    *   Personal content affinity (from the user’s profile).
    *   Cluster resonance prediction.
    *   Content age (favoring newer content).
3. **A/B Testing and Feedback Loops**: Continuously A/B test different content ranking algorithms and incorporate user feedback (clicks, shares, comments) to refine the prediction models.

**Pseudocode (Content Ranking):**

```
function rankContent(user, contentList):
  userCluster = identifyUserCluster(user)
  rankedList = []
  for content in contentList:
    personalAffinityScore = calculatePersonalAffinity(user, content)
    clusterResonanceScore = calculateClusterResonance(userCluster, content)
    contentAgeScore = calculateContentAgeScore(content)
    combinedScore = (0.5 * personalAffinityScore) + (0.3 * clusterResonanceScore) + (0.2 * contentAgeScore)
    rankedList.append((content, combinedScore))
  rankedList.sort(key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)
  return [content for content, score in rankedList]
```

This approach moves beyond simple demographic targeting to incorporate a richer understanding of user behavior and social influence, potentially leading to more engaging and relevant content experiences.
