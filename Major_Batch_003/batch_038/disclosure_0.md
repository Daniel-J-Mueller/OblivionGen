## Dynamic Content "Layers" & Temporal Association

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple content ranking and summaries to create dynamically layered content experiences tailored to the user's predicted cognitive state and immediate context. This builds on the idea of presenting content *from* a user's network, but reframes *how* it's presented.

**Specs:**

*   **Cognitive State Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: User interaction data (scroll speed, dwell time on content, reaction types, time of day, location, device type, calendar data – with permission).
    *   Process: Employ a lightweight ML model (e.g., LSTM or Transformer) to predict the user’s current cognitive state – categorized as *Exploratory*, *Focused*, *Relaxed*, or *Distracted*.  Output is a probability distribution across these states.
*   **Temporal Association Engine:**
    *   Input: Content items (text, images, video), timestamps, user interaction history.
    *   Process:  Analyze user interactions with content over time.  Identify *patterns* of content consumption linked to specific times, days, locations, or predicted cognitive states.  Build a "temporal association graph" where nodes are content items and edges represent the strength of the association between content and context.
*   **Dynamic Layering System:**
    *   Input: Predicted Cognitive State, Temporal Association Graph, Ranked Content Items.
    *   Process: 
        1.  Based on the predicted cognitive state, select a "layering strategy."
            *   **Exploratory:** Present a diverse mix of content, emphasizing visual elements and brief summaries.  High "discovery" weight.
            *   **Focused:** Prioritize in-depth content related to the user’s known interests. Minimize distractions.
            *   **Relaxed:**  Show lighter, more emotionally resonant content.  Emphasis on images and videos.
            *   **Distracted:** Short-form content, humorous elements, and strong visual cues to re-engage the user.
        2.  Utilize the temporal association graph to filter and prioritize content items within the selected layering strategy.  Give higher weight to content that has been historically consumed in similar contexts.
        3.  Dynamically assemble a layered content feed. Layers could include:
            *   **Primary Layer:** Ranked content items.
            *   **Contextual Layer:** Content historically consumed in similar contexts.
            *   **Serendipity Layer:**  Content identified as potentially interesting based on user preferences but not explicitly ranked.  Low weight.
            *   **"Time Capsule" Layer:** Content from the same date in previous years (e.g., photos, status updates) presented as a nostalgic element.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Content Feed:  Visually distinguish layers (e.g., using different card styles or subtle animations).
    *   Layer Control: Allow users to customize layer visibility and weight (optional).
    *   "Time Capsule" Preview:  Display a snippet of the "Time Capsule" content as a notification.

**Pseudocode (Layering System):**

```
function assemble_layered_feed(predicted_cognitive_state, temporal_association_graph, ranked_content_items):
    layering_strategy = select_layering_strategy(predicted_cognitive_state)

    primary_layer = ranked_content_items

    contextual_layer = filter_content(temporal_association_graph, layering_strategy.context_filters)

    serendipity_layer = select_serendipity_content(user_preferences, layering_strategy.serendipity_weight)

    time_capsule_content = get_time_capsule_content(user_history)

    layered_feed = [primary_layer, contextual_layer, serendipity_layer, time_capsule_content]

    return layered_feed
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with wearable sensors to detect user's emotional state (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance) for even more precise layering.
*   "Dream Sequence" layering:  Present content items that are subtly connected to the user's interests but are outside of their normal consumption patterns.
*   "Collective Memory" layering: Present content trending among the user's network in similar contexts.
