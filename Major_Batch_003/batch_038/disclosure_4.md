## Dynamic Content Provider "Mood" Indicators

**Concept:** Extend the existing identifier presentation differences (Claim 5) to represent not just *access* history, but a real-time "mood" or activity status of the content provider, influencing how their ephemeral content is displayed.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Input:**

*   **Provider Activity API:** Each content provider integrates (or our system polls) an API exposing activity data. This data is categorized into at least three states:
    *   **Active/Live:**  Provider is currently broadcasting live ephemeral content.
    *   **Idle/Available:** Provider is online but not actively broadcasting.
    *   **Offline/Inactive:** Provider is offline or unavailable.
*   **User Interaction Data:** Monitor user engagement with provider content (views, likes, shares).

**2. Identifier Modification:**

*   **Visual Cue:**  Provider identifiers (avatars, names) change appearance based on their activity state:
    *   **Active/Live:** Identifier pulsates with a bright color (e.g., animated glow).  Potentially display a small "LIVE" badge.
    *   **Idle/Available:**  Identifier is subtly animated (e.g., gentle scaling).  Solid color.
    *   **Offline/Inactive:**  Identifier is desaturated and dimmed.  May display a small "Offline" indicator.
*   **Priority Display:** Content from "Active/Live" providers is displayed *above* content from "Idle" or "Offline" providers in the ephemeral feed.  Sort by activity status *then* engagement metrics.

**3.  User Customization:**

*   **"Focus Mode":**  Allow users to filter the ephemeral feed to only show content from providers who are currently "Active/Live."
*   **"Quiet Mode":**  Allow users to hide content from providers who are currently "Active/Live."
*   **Mood Preferences:**  Allow users to specify content provider “moods” they’d like to see prioritized.

**4. Algorithm Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION UpdateProviderIndicators(ProviderList, UserPreferences)

  FOR EACH Provider IN ProviderList
    ActivityStatus = GetProviderActivityStatus(Provider) // API Call
    EngagementScore = CalculateEngagementScore(Provider)  // Views, likes, etc.

    IF ActivityStatus == "Active" THEN
      IndicatorColor = "Bright Pulse"
      DisplayPriority = 1
    ELSE IF ActivityStatus == "Idle" THEN
      IndicatorColor = "Subtle Animation"
      DisplayPriority = 2
    ELSE
      IndicatorColor = "Desaturated"
      DisplayPriority = 3

    // Apply User Preferences
    IF UserPrefers("Quiet Mode") AND ActivityStatus == "Active" THEN
        DisplayPriority = 99 // Push to bottom of feed
    ELSE IF UserPrefers("Focus Mode") AND DisplayPriority > 1 THEN
        DisplayPriority = 99 // Push to bottom of feed
    ENDIF

    UpdateProviderIdentifier(Provider, IndicatorColor)
    SetProviderDisplayPriority(Provider, DisplayPriority)
  ENDFOR

  SortProviderListByDisplayPriority(ProviderList)
  Return ProviderList
END FUNCTION
```

**5. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Emotional State Indicators:** Integrate sentiment analysis of provider’s recent posts to display mood-related icons (e.g., happy face, sad face).
*   **Collaboration Signals:** Indicate when multiple providers are collaborating on a live broadcast.
*   **Gamification:** Reward providers for consistent live streaming and high engagement.
