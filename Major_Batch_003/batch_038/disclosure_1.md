## Dynamic Lookup Table Modulation via Neural Network Prediction

**Concept:** Enhance the piecewise-linear lookup table (LUT) scheme by dynamically modulating the LUTâ€™s slope and intercept values *per pixel* based on predictions from a lightweight neural network. This moves beyond a static LUT to a context-aware, adaptive tone mapping system.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** High Dynamic Range (HDR) video stream (YCbCr or RGB format).
*   **Neural Network:** A small, convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to predict LUT modulation parameters.
    *   **Input:** A localized region around each pixel (e.g., 5x5 or 7x7 patch) in the HDR image.
    *   **Output:** Two channels: one representing a scalar multiplier for the LUT slope, and another representing an additive offset for the LUT intercept. These values should be constrained to a reasonable range (e.g., 0.5-1.5 for slope multiplier, -0.1 to 0.1 for intercept offset).
    *   **Architecture:** 3-5 convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by a global average pooling layer and two fully connected layers to produce the output channels.  Minimize parameter count for real-time performance.
*   **LUT Structure:** Maintain the original piecewise-linear LUT as a base.
*   **Modulation Process (per pixel):**
    1.  Extract the localized region around the pixel.
    2.  Pass the region through the CNN to obtain slope multiplier and intercept offset.
    3.  Retrieve the base slope and intercept from the LUT for the corresponding input value.
    4.  Calculate the modulated slope: `modulated_slope = base_slope * slope_multiplier`.
    5.  Calculate the modulated intercept: `modulated_intercept = base_intercept + intercept_offset`.
    6.  Calculate the output value: `output_value = input_value * modulated_slope + modulated_intercept`.
*   **Training:** Train the CNN using a dataset of HDR images and corresponding desired SDR outputs.  Loss function should combine a perceptual loss (e.g., LPIPS) with a pixel-wise loss (e.g., L1 or L2).
*   **Hardware Implementation:** FPGA or dedicated ASIC for real-time performance.  The CNN can be pipelined for increased throughput.
*   **Color Gamut Mapping:** Incorporate a color gamut mapping function *before* the LUT modulation. This ensures that colors remain within the SDR gamut.  The gamut mapping function can also be learned as part of the training process.
*   **Temporal Filtering:** Apply a temporal filter to the modulation parameters to reduce flickering and instability. This can be a simple moving average filter or a more sophisticated Kalman filter.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processPixel(hdrPixel, localizedRegion):
  modulationParams = CNN(localizedRegion)
  slopeMultiplier = modulationParams.slope
  interceptOffset = modulationParams.intercept
  baseSlope = LUT.getSlope(hdrPixel)
  baseIntercept = LUT.getIntercept(hdrPixel)
  modulatedSlope = baseSlope * slopeMultiplier
  modulatedIntercept = baseIntercept + interceptOffset
  outputPixel = hdrPixel * modulatedSlope + modulatedIntercept
  return outputPixel
```
