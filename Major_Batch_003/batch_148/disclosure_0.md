## Network Anomaly Detection via Predictive Graph Evolution

**Concept:** Extend the network graph estimation technique to *predict* future graph states, identifying anomalies based on deviations from predicted evolution. This moves beyond static or reactive asset tracking to proactive anomaly detection and potential threat anticipation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Graph Engine:**

*   **Input:** Historical network graph data (collected over time, utilizing the existing peer-to-peer polling and estimation methods), asset type data, traffic patterns, and known vulnerability profiles.
*   **Core Algorithm:** Utilize a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) - specifically, a Graph RNN - to model the temporal evolution of the network graph.  The Graph RNN should be trained to predict the next state of the graph (node/edge additions/removals, weight changes) based on the preceding 'n' states.  Consider variations:
    *   **Node-level Prediction:** Predict changes in node attributes (e.g., security posture, resource utilization).
    *   **Edge-level Prediction:** Predict the creation or removal of connections between nodes.
    *   **Graph-level Prediction:** Predict changes in overall graph metrics (e.g., diameter, density).
*   **Training Data Generation:**  The RNN should be trained on a rolling window of historical network graph data. Data augmentation techniques (e.g., introducing simulated network events) can improve robustness.
*   **Output:** A predicted network graph state for a specified future time horizon.  Include a confidence interval for each prediction.

**2. Anomaly Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Current network graph, predicted network graph, confidence intervals.
*   **Anomaly Scoring:** Calculate an anomaly score based on the deviation between the current graph and the predicted graph.  Consider these factors:
    *   **Node/Edge Discrepancies:** Count the number of nodes/edges that exist in the current graph but are not predicted, or vice versa.
    *   **Weight Discrepancies:** Measure the difference in edge weights between the current and predicted graphs.
    *   **Structural Discrepancies:** Calculate graph metrics (e.g., shortest path lengths, centrality measures) for both graphs and measure the difference.
    *   **Confidence Interval Breaches:** Flag discrepancies that fall outside the predicted confidence intervals.
*   **Thresholding:** Apply adaptive thresholds to the anomaly score to identify potentially anomalous events.  Thresholds should be adjusted based on historical data and network context.

**3. Remediation Action Generator:**

*   **Input:** Anomaly score, type of anomaly (node/edge/structural), affected nodes/edges.
*   **Action Selection:**  Based on the anomaly characteristics, select appropriate remediation actions.  Examples:
    *   **Unexpected Node:** Quarantine the node, investigate its activity.
    *   **Unexpected Edge:** Block the connection, analyze traffic patterns.
    *   **Structural Anomaly:** Trigger a network scan, update firewall rules.
*   **Action Prioritization:** Rank remediation actions based on their potential impact and risk.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detect_anomaly(current_graph, predicted_graph, confidence_intervals):
  anomaly_score = 0
  
  # Node Discrepancy
  missing_nodes = current_graph.nodes() - predicted_graph.nodes()
  anomaly_score += len(missing_nodes) * 10 
  
  # Edge Discrepancy
  missing_edges = current_graph.edges() - predicted_graph.edges()
  anomaly_score += len(missing_edges) * 5
  
  # Weight Discrepancy
  for edge in current_graph.edges():
      weight_diff = abs(current_graph.get_edge_weight(edge) - predicted_graph.get_edge_weight(edge))
      anomaly_score += weight_diff * 0.1
      
  #Confidence Interval Check (simplified)
  for edge in current_graph.edges():
      if abs(current_graph.get_edge_weight(edge) - predicted_graph.get_edge_weight(edge)) > confidence_intervals[edge]:
          anomaly_score += 2

  if anomaly_score > threshold:
    return True, anomaly_score
  else:
    return False, anomaly_score
```

**Novelty:** This system shifts from *detecting* current asset presence to *predicting* future network states, enabling proactive anomaly detection and threat anticipation. Existing solutions primarily focus on reactive asset tracking and static analysis. The use of Graph RNNs for network prediction is a novel application within this context.
