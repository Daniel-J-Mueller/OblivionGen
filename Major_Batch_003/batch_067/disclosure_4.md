**Dynamic Content 'Stitching' & Collaborative Worldbuilding**

**Concept:** Extend collaborative posting beyond simple co-authorship to enable users to collaboratively *build* larger, interconnected digital ‘worlds’ or narratives. Imagine a shared, evolving story, a collaboratively designed virtual space, or a branching choose-your-own-adventure experience constructed organically through linked posts.

**Specs:**

*   **Post Linking System:**  Introduce a 'Stitch' function within the posting interface.  This allows a user to designate another existing post (anywhere on the platform) as a direct 'parent' or 'child' post, creating a directed graph relationship.  These links aren’t merely displayed – they are semantically understood by the system.
*   **World/Narrative Canvas:**  A dedicated visual interface (the 'Canvas') displays posts not as a linear feed, but as nodes in a graph.  Users can filter/sort nodes by author, timestamp, tags, content type, etc.  The Canvas allows for spatial arrangement of nodes – positioning posts relative to each other to visually represent connections and hierarchy.
*   **Content Fragments & 'Seeds':** Users can post 'Seeds' - intentionally incomplete content fragments designed to be expanded upon by others.  These fragments include designated 'expansion points' - areas where other users are explicitly invited to contribute.
*   **Permissions Granularity:** Beyond basic co-authoring permissions, introduce tiered permissions for 'expansion points'.  A Seed author can grant specific users (or groups) the right to expand *only* certain parts of the content, maintaining creative control.
*   **Automated Storyboarding/Worldmap Generation:**  The system automatically generates visual 'storyboards' or 'worldmaps' based on the graph structure of linked posts. These visualizations highlight key relationships and branching narratives.  Users can customize the appearance of these visuals.
*   **Contextual AI Assistance:** Integrate an AI assistant that analyzes the linked posts and suggests potential connections, expansion points, or narrative threads. The AI could also generate placeholder content or visual assets to jumpstart the collaborative process.
*   **'Ecosystem' Metrics:** Track metrics beyond simple likes and shares. Measure 'Ecosystem Health' based on factors like content diversity, author collaboration, expansion rate, and narrative coherence.

**Pseudocode (linking process):**

```
function createPost(content, author) {
  post = new Post(content, author);
  post.id = generateUniqueId();
  return post;
}

function stitchPosts(childPost, parentPost) {
  if (isValidPost(childPost) && isValidPost(parentPost)) {
    childPost.parent = parentPost;
    parentPost.children.add(childPost);
    updateGraph(childPost, parentPost); //Visually update graph on Canvas
  } else {
    displayError("Invalid posts selected for stitching.");
  }
}
```

**Example Use Case:**

A group of users collaboratively builds a fantasy world. One user posts a description of a city ('Seed'). Another user 'stitches' a post detailing a key NPC within that city. A third user adds a post describing a quest that starts in that city. The system automatically generates a visual map showing the city, the NPC, and the quest, linked together.  Users can explore the world through the Canvas, discovering new content and contributing their own creations.
