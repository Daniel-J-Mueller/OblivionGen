## Intent-Driven Procedural Content Generation

**Concept:** Leverage identified user intent (as determined by the provided patent's system) not just for targeted suggestions, but to dynamically generate personalized procedural content *within* messaging experiences. This shifts from reactive suggestion delivery to proactive environment creation.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Modules:**

*   **Intent-to-Scene Mapping:** A module translating intent groups into parameters for procedural content generation. This uses a configurable mapping table. Example: "Travel Planning - Destination Research (Stage 2 - Active)" maps to parameters for generating a miniature interactive map with points of interest.
*   **Procedural Content Engine:** A lightweight engine capable of generating various content types:
    *   **Visual:** Simple 2D/3D scenes, animated icons, stylized text.
    *   **Interactive:** Miniature games, quizzes, branching narratives, configurable widgets.
    *   **Audio:** Ambient soundscapes, short musical motifs, synthesized voice snippets.
*   **Content Delivery Interface:** A component integrated within the messaging server, responsible for rendering and delivering generated content as messages. Supports various output formats (images, videos, interactive message components).

**II. Workflow:**

1.  **Intent Detection:** The existing patent’s intent model analyzes user messages to identify intent groups and their strength.
2.  **Content Request:** The Intent-to-Scene Mapping module receives the intent group and queries the Procedural Content Engine.
3.  **Content Generation:** The Procedural Content Engine generates content based on the intent parameters.  Parameters include:
    *   **Content Type:** (Map, Quiz, Game, Widget)
    *   **Theme:** (Based on identified user interests - e.g., "Adventure," "Relaxation," "Productivity")
    *   **Complexity:** (Determined by the intent stage – higher stage = more complex content)
    *   **Data Sources:**  API access to external data (weather, news, location information) can be incorporated.
4.  **Content Delivery:** The generated content is delivered to the user as a message.  The message can include interactive elements (buttons, sliders) to allow the user to further customize the experience.

**III. Pseudocode (Content Generation Example – "Travel Planning - Destination Research"):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateDestinationResearchContent(intentGroup):
  // Extract intent parameters
  destination = ExtractDestinationFromIntent(intentGroup)
  interest = ExtractInterestFromIntent(intentGroup)
  stage = GetIntentStage(intentGroup)

  // Create a map object
  map = CreateMap(center = destination)

  // Add points of interest based on interest and stage
  IF stage >= 2:
    AddPOI(map, type = "Landmark", data = GetLandmarkData(destination, interest))
    AddPOI(map, type = "Restaurant", data = GetRestaurantData(destination, interest))
  ELSE:
    AddPOI(map, type = "Generic", data = GetGenericData(destination))

  // Add interactive elements
  AddButton(map, label = "Show Weather", action = GetWeather(destination))
  AddSlider(map, label = "Filter POIs", action = FilterPOIs(interest))

  // Render map as image
  image = RenderMap(map)

  RETURN image
```

**IV. Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Existing messaging server infrastructure (as per provided patent).
*   Procedural Content Engine (custom developed or 3rd party).
*   API access to relevant data sources (weather, maps, points of interest).
*   Rendering capabilities within the messaging server.
