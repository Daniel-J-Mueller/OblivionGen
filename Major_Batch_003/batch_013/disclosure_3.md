**Dynamic Preference Drift Modeling via Temporal Graph Embeddings**

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on static or inferred user preferences. This design introduces a system that actively *models preference drift* over time, leveraging temporal graph embeddings to capture evolving tastes and contextual influences. This isn't just about "what" a user likes, but "when" and "why" their preferences change.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Order History (as in the original patent)
    *   Real-time Contextual Data: Location (GPS), Time of Day, Day of Week, Weather, Social Media Activity (public posts only - sentiment analysis), News Feeds (relevant topic extraction).
    *   Social Graph: Connections between users, vendors, and "concept nodes" (e.g., "Italian Food," "Outdoor Activities").  The graph *must* be time-stamped – edges/relationships have start and end dates to model evolving connections.

*   **Temporal Graph Construction:**
    *   A dynamic graph is constructed where nodes represent users, vendors, catalog items, and concept nodes.
    *   Edges represent interactions (orders, likes, shares, social connections).  Each edge has a timestamp.
    *   Edge weights represent interaction strength (e.g., order frequency, like count).

*   **Temporal Graph Embedding Model:**
    *   Employ a graph neural network (GNN) capable of handling temporal data.  Specifically, a Temporal Graph Network (TGN) or a similar architecture.
    *   The TGN learns node embeddings that capture both the graph structure *and* the temporal dynamics of interactions.
    *   Separate embedding spaces for users, vendors, and items are maintained.
    *   The embedding model must be trained end-to-end using a loss function that encourages accurate prediction of future interactions. (e.g., link prediction)

*   **Preference Drift Modeling:**
    *   User preference vectors are derived from the user embeddings. These vectors aren’t static; they evolve over time as the GNN learns from new interactions and contextual data.
    *   A “drift rate” metric is calculated for each user based on the magnitude of change in their preference vector over a defined time window.  High drift rates indicate rapidly changing preferences.

*   **Recommendation Engine:**
    *   Recommendations are generated by calculating a similarity score between the user’s current preference vector, the catalog item vector (derived from metadata), and the current contextual factors.
    *   The similarity score is adjusted based on the user’s drift rate.  Users with high drift rates receive recommendations that are more diverse and exploratory.
    *   A contextual relevance score is calculated based on the similarity between the user's current location, time of day, and the vendor's location and operating hours.

*   **Pseudocode (Recommendation Generation):**

```
function generate_recommendations(user_id, catalog, current_context):
  user_embedding = get_user_embedding(user_id)
  user_preference_vector = derive_preference_vector(user_embedding)
  drift_rate = calculate_drift_rate(user_id)

  recommendations = []
  for item in catalog:
    item_embedding = get_item_embedding(item.id)
    item_vector = derive_vector(item_embedding)

    similarity_score = cosine_similarity(user_preference_vector, item_vector)

    contextual_relevance = calculate_contextual_relevance(user_location, item_vendor_location, current_time)

    final_score = similarity_score + (contextual_relevance * drift_rate)

    recommendations.append((item, final_score))

  recommendations.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  return recommendations[:10] #Return Top 10
```

*   **Hardware/Software:**
    *   GPU-accelerated servers for training and inference of the GNN.
    *   Distributed graph database (e.g., Neo4j) for storing and querying the temporal graph.
    *   Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch for model development and deployment.
    *   Real-time data streaming platform (e.g., Kafka) for ingesting contextual data.
