**Dynamic Emotional Subtitle Generation**

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple transcription and editing to generate subtitles which dynamically reflect the *emotional tone* of the audio, visually communicated through color, size, font, and subtle animation. This creates a more immersive and accessible viewing experience, particularly for viewers who may not be able to fully hear the audio or who benefit from visual cues to understand emotional context.

**Specs:**

1.  **Emotion Detection Module:**
    *   Input: Audio clip.
    *   Process: Utilize a real-time emotion detection AI model (trained on speech prosody, vocal tone, and potentially speaker identification for baseline emotional states). Output a continuous stream of emotion scores (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, fear, neutrality) with confidence levels.

2.  **Subtitle Styling Engine:**
    *   Input: Emotion scores, text caption, timestamp.
    *   Process:
        *   **Color Mapping:**  Map emotion scores to a color palette.  (e.g., High happiness = bright yellow/orange, High sadness = deep blue/gray, High anger = red, High fear = purple). Utilize hue-saturation-brightness (HSB) adjustments for smooth transitions.
        *   **Size/Weight Modulation:**  Increase font size or weight (boldness) proportionally to the intensity of the dominant emotion.
        *   **Font Selection:**  Associate specific font families with emotional categories. (e.g., A playful, rounded font for happiness, a sharp, angular font for anger).
        *   **Animation:** Subtle animations (e.g., a gentle pulse, a slight color shift, a scale effect) triggered by significant emotional changes. Animation duration is limited to avoid distraction (max 0.5 seconds).
        *   **Timing:**  Synchronize subtitle style changes to the emotional shifts in the audio.  Implement a smoothing algorithm to prevent abrupt changes.

3.  **User Customization Interface:**
    *   Allow users to:
        *   Adjust the color palette.
        *   Modify the animation intensity.
        *   Select preferred fonts.
        *   Toggle emotion visualization on/off.
        *   Create custom emotion profiles (e.g., a “calm” profile with muted colors and minimal animation).

4.  **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   The emotion detection and styling engine will integrate seamlessly with the existing speech-to-text and subtitle editing workflow. The user can edit the generated subtitles *after* the emotional styling has been applied.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateEmotionalSubtitles(audioClip, textCaption):
  emotionScores = detectEmotions(audioClip)
  styledSubtitles = []

  for each word in textCaption:
    timestamp = getWordTimestamp(word)
    emotionAtTimestamp = getEmotionAtTimestamp(emotionScores, timestamp)

    color = mapEmotionToColor(emotionAtTimestamp)
    size = mapEmotionToSize(emotionAtTimestamp)
    font = mapEmotionToFont(emotionAtTimestamp)
    animation = generateAnimation(emotionAtTimestamp)

    styledWord = {
      text: word,
      color: color,
      size: size,
      font: font,
      animation: animation
    }
    styledSubtitles.append(styledWord)

  return styledSubtitles
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Speaker-Specific Emotion Profiles:** Adapt the emotion styling based on the emotional baseline of individual speakers.
*   **Multilingual Support:** Train emotion detection models for different languages.
*   **Accessibility Features:**  Provide options for colorblind viewers.
*   **Integration with VR/AR:**  Display emotional subtitles in a 3D space, synchronized with the speaker's mouth movements.
