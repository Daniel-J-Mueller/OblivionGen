## Dynamic Story Remixing

**Concept:** Extend the time-delayed story publication with a system that allows the user (or an AI acting on their behalf) to *remix* the published story with additional content *before* it reaches their timeline. This turns passive publication into an active, collaborative content creation moment.

**Specs:**

**1. Remix Interface:**

*   **Trigger:** Upon initiating story publication (after the timer expires), instead of *immediate* timeline posting, a "Remix Story" interface is presented to the user.
*   **Content Blocks:** The initial story is presented as modular "content blocks": Visual indicator (image/video clip), Share option, Like option, Remove option.
*   **Remix Elements:** Below the initial blocks, a palette of remix elements is displayed. These are dynamically generated based on:
    *   **Program Metadata:** Genre, actors, director, related keywords.
    *   **User Data:**  Recent activity, liked pages/groups, connected apps (Spotify, Goodreads, etc.).
    *   **Trending Content:** Popular hashtags, memes, reactions relevant to the program or user.
*   **Element Types:**
    *   **Visuals:**  GIFs, stickers, short video clips, custom images/text overlays.
    *   **Text:** Pre-written phrases ("Currently watching!", "Obsessed with this show!"), customizable text fields.
    *   **Polls/Quizzes:**  "Who's your favorite character?", "Predict what happens next!"
    *   **Music Integration:**  Add a snippet of the show's soundtrack or a related song.
    *   **Link to External Content:**  Link to a review, article, or product related to the program.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** User can drag and drop remix elements into the story, reordering blocks and customizing their appearance.
*   **AI-Assisted Remix:**  Option to activate "AI Remix," where an algorithm automatically generates multiple remix options based on user preferences and trending content. The user can then select one or further customize it.

**2.  Timeline Integration**

*   **Remix Preview:**  User can preview the remixed story before publishing it to their timeline.
*   **Publish Options:** Standard privacy settings apply.
*   **Remix Attribution:**  If the user uses AI-assisted remix, attribution is displayed (e.g., "Remixed with AI").
*   **Story Interaction:**  Remixed stories retain all original interaction options (share, like, remove) and potentially gain new ones based on added elements (e.g., vote in a poll).

**3.  Backend Logic (Pseudocode)**

```
function publishStoryWithRemix(user, program, timerElapsed) {
  if (timerElapsed) {
    generateInitialStory(user, program);
    fetchRemixElements(user, program);
    presentRemixInterface(user, initialStory, remixElements);

    remixedStory = userRemixesStory(initialStory, remixElements);

    publishStoryToTimeline(user, remixedStory);
  }
}

function fetchRemixElements(user, program) {
  programMetadata = getProgramMetadata(program);
  userData = getUserData(user);
  trendingContent = getTrendingContent(program, user);

  remixElements = combine(programMetadata, userData, trendingContent);
  return remixElements;
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Collaborative Remix:** Allow friends to contribute to the remix process.
*   **Remix Challenges:**  Create themed remix challenges based on popular programs.
*   **Monetization:**  Allow brands to create branded remix elements.
