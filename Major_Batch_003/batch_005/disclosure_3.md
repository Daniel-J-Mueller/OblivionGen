## Dynamic Content 'Bloom' - Personalized Information Expansion

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of presenting content based on viewport dwell time – but instead of *just* providing text, dynamically expand the content ‘bloom’ with related information, media, and interactive elements, scaled to user engagement and predicted interest.  This moves beyond simple text fallback to a rich, evolving content experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module: ‘Bloom Engine’** – A real-time content expansion module integrated into the content feed system.
*   **Engagement Signal Input:** Receives viewport dwell time *and* additional user signals: scroll speed, cursor movement (hover/click), micro-interactions (e.g., liking/disliking).
*   **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Connects to a dynamic knowledge graph representing relationships between content topics, entities, and user profiles.
*   **Content ‘Petal’ Definitions:**  Content is structured into ‘petals’ – modular blocks of information:
    *   *Text Petal:* Baseline text content (as in the original patent).
    *   *Media Petal:* Images, videos, audio clips.
    *   *Link Petal:* External or internal links to related content.
    *   *Interactive Petal:* Polls, quizzes, 3D models, AR experiences.
    *   *Context Petal:* Real-time data (e.g., stock prices, weather, location-specific info).
*   **Bloom Radius:** A dynamically adjusted radius around the initially visible content snippet.  Higher engagement = larger radius.
*   **Petal Prioritization:**  A scoring system to determine which petals to display based on:
    *   User Interest Profile (Machine Learning Model)
    *   Content Relevance Score (Knowledge Graph)
    *   Petal Complexity/Resource Cost.
*   **Dynamic Loading:** Petals are loaded and rendered on-demand as the user interacts with the content or the bloom radius expands. Prefetching of high-probability petals based on predictive models.
*   **Engagement-Based Bloom Control:**
    *   **Low Engagement:**  Only text petal displayed. Minimal data transfer.
    *   **Medium Engagement:** Text + relevant media petal(s) loaded. Bloom radius expands slightly.
    *   **High Engagement:** Text + multiple media/link/interactive petals loaded. Bloom radius expands significantly. AR/3D elements activated (if applicable).
*   **User Customization:**  Ability to adjust bloom sensitivity, petal types, and AR/3D preferences.

**Pseudocode (Bloom Engine Core):**

```
function processContentSnippet(snippet, userProfile, viewportDwellTime, scrollSpeed):
  engagementScore = calculateEngagementScore(viewportDwellTime, scrollSpeed, userProfile)
  bloomRadius = calculateBloomRadius(engagementScore, userProfile.bloomSensitivity)
  relevantPetals = getRelevantPetals(snippet, userProfile, bloomRadius) //Uses Knowledge Graph
  prioritizedPetals = prioritizePetals(relevantPetals, userProfile)
  loadAndRenderPetals(prioritizedPetals)
  return
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires robust content delivery network (CDN) to handle dynamic loading.
*   Knowledge graph needs to be scalable and up-to-date.
*   Machine learning models for user profiling and petal prioritization need regular training.
*   AR/3D rendering requires capable client devices.
