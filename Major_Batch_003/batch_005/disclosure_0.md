## Dynamic Segment Stitching for Personalized ABR

**Concept:** Extend the ABR packaging process to allow *real-time* segment stitching based on user device capabilities *and* network conditions, going beyond pre-defined quality levels. This creates a truly personalized ABR stream.

**Specs:**

1.  **Enhanced Manifest:** The manifest will include not just quality levels, but *segment profiles*. Each profile defines encoding parameters (resolution, bitrate, codec) and a 'compatibility score' based on device/network characteristics.  The compatibility score is calculated client-side.

    ```
    Manifest Entry:
    {
      "segment_id": "seg_123",
      "base_url": "https://example.com/video/seg_123",
      "profile": {
        "resolution": "1920x1080",
        "bitrate": "5 Mbps",
        "codec": "H.264",
        "compatibility_score_weighting": {
            "device_processing_power": 0.6,
            "network_bandwidth": 0.4
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Client-Side Segment Selection:** The ABR player will:
    *   Continuously monitor device capabilities (CPU, GPU, screen resolution) and network bandwidth.
    *   Calculate a 'device score' based on monitored metrics.
    *   For each incoming segment, calculate a 'compatibility score' for *each* available profile using weighted metrics.  (e.g., Device Score * device\_processing\_power\_weight + Network Bandwidth * network\_bandwidth\_weight)
    *   Select the segment profile with the *highest* compatibility score.

3.  **Segment Stitching Module:** The ABR player will incorporate a segment stitching module.  This module:
    *   Downloads the selected segment.
    *   Potentially performs on-the-fly re-encoding (resolution scaling, bitrate adjustment) if the selected segment does *not* perfectly match the player's current output requirements.  (Low latency encoding essential)
    *   Stitches the processed segment into the continuous stream.

4.  **Server-Side Segment Generation:** The server will generate a wider range of segment variations than traditional ABR. Segments will be created with granular differences in encoding parameters. (e.g. 2.2Mbps, 2.3Mbps, 2.4Mbps)

5. **Dynamic Profile Adjustment:** The server will accept feedback from the client on segment delivery quality (buffering, errors). It will use this feedback to dynamically adjust the weighting of the compatibility score on a per-user basis.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Segment Selection):**

```
function selectSegment(segment_id, available_profiles):
  device_score = calculateDeviceScore()
  network_bandwidth = getNetworkBandwidth()

  best_profile = null
  best_score = -1

  for profile in available_profiles:
    compatibility_score = (device_score * profile.compatibility_score_weighting.device_processing_power +
                          network_bandwidth * profile.compatibility_score_weighting.network_bandwidth)

    if compatibility_score > best_score:
      best_score = compatibility_score
      best_profile = profile

  return best_profile
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond pre-defined ABR levels and adapts *every segment* to the user’s *current* conditions. It isn't merely switching between pre-encoded qualities; it’s building a customized stream, segment by segment. This granular adaptation maximizes quality without buffering, resulting in a truly seamless viewing experience.
