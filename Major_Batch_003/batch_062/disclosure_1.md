## Dynamic Contextual Threading with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the comment threading system to incorporate a dynamic, contextual layering based on temporal decay and user-defined “focus areas.” Instead of purely hierarchical indentations, comments exist within fading “context bubbles” linked to initiating comments, allowing for branching conversations *and* a visual representation of conversation age/relevance.

**Specification:**

**1. Context Bubble Creation:**

*   Upon posting a comment, a “context bubble” is created visually linked to the initiating comment.  This bubble initially displays the new comment prominently.
*   The size and opacity of the bubble decrease over time, representing decreasing relevance. The decay rate is configurable by the system administrator, or potentially by users (see User Configuration below).
*   Bubbles are visually clustered around the initiating comment, creating a dynamic “conversation cloud”.

**2.  Thread Navigation & Expansion:**

*   Users can click/tap on a context bubble to expand it, revealing all direct replies *within* that bubble. This creates a temporary “focus” on that sub-conversation.
*   Expanding a bubble doesn't necessarily *hide* other bubbles. Overlapping bubbles are semi-transparent.
*   A “collapse all” function is available to return to a high-level overview.

**3. User Configuration – “Focus Areas”:**

*   Users can designate certain keywords or topics as “focus areas.”
*   Comments containing those keywords receive a temporary “boost” in bubble size/opacity, keeping them more visible.
*   This allows users to prioritize conversations related to their interests.

**4.  Temporal Decay Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
function calculateBubbleOpacity(commentAgeInHours, baseOpacity):
  decayRate = 0.05 //Adjustable parameter
  opacity = baseOpacity * exp(-decayRate * commentAgeInHours)
  return clamp(opacity, 0.1, 1.0) // Ensure opacity remains within reasonable bounds
```

**5.  Visual Representation:**

*   Context bubbles should be visually distinct, potentially using gradients or subtle animations to indicate age and relevance.
*   Focus areas could be highlighted with a different color or border.
*   A "heatmap" overlay could visualize the density of active conversations.

**6.  Data Structures:**

*   **Comment Object:**
    *   `commentId`
    *   `parentId` (ID of the initiating comment)
    *   `timestamp`
    *   `content`
    *   `keywords` (array of keywords extracted from content)
    *   `opacity` (calculated dynamically)
*   **Conversation Cloud:** (Data structure to manage bubbles)
    *   `rootCommentId`
    *   `bubbles` (list of Comment Objects, sorted by opacity)

**7.  Interaction Model:**

*   **Hover/Tap:** Briefly highlight the bubble, showing a preview of the comment.
*   **Click/Double-Tap:** Expand the bubble, revealing all direct replies.
*   **Drag/Swipe:** Re-arrange bubbles manually, creating custom groupings.
*   **Context Menu:** Options for flagging, reporting, or hiding comments.



This system moves beyond simple linear or hierarchical threading to provide a more organic and visually intuitive way to navigate complex conversations.  The temporal decay and user-defined focus areas ensure that the most relevant information remains visible while allowing users to explore the full breadth of the discussion.
