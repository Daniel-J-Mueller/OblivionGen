**Dynamic Merchant Storytelling with AI-Driven Visual Narrative Generation**

**Concept:** Expand beyond static custom interfaces and product displays. Create a dynamic, visually-rich merchant "story" presented to the user, tailored to their observed preferences and real-time contextual data. The system leverages AI to generate a short-form video or interactive visual narrative combining product showcases, lifestyle imagery, and subtle branding, presented *within* the client application, rather than merely displaying a product list.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Merchant-provided assets: High-resolution images, short video clips (lifestyle, product demos), brand style guide (colors, fonts).
    *   Product Feed: As in the source patent.
    *   User Data: Historical purchase data, browsing history within the client application, location (with permission), time of day, weather, potentially social media preferences (with explicit opt-in).
*   **AI Narrative Engine:**
    *   **Scene Selection:** Based on user data & product feed, the AI selects a sequence of visual “scenes.” Each scene focuses on a curated set of products.
    *   **Visual Asset Assembly:** The AI assembles scenes by combining merchant-provided assets (images/videos) with dynamically rendered product images. It applies branding elements from the style guide.
    *   **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Narration:** Optional – AI generates a short, contextual voiceover for each scene, highlighting key product benefits. Voice style customizable per merchant.
    *   **Music Generation/Selection:** AI generates or selects background music that complements the scene's mood and branding.
*   **Rendering & Presentation:**
    *   **Format:** Short-form video (5-15 seconds) or interactive visual sequence.
    *   **Integration:** Seamlessly presented *within* the client application's user interface. Designed to feel native, not like an advertisement.
    *   **Dynamic Transitions:** Visually engaging transitions between scenes.
    *   **Call to Action:** Subtle, integrated call to action (e.g., "Shop Now," "Learn More") linked directly to the merchant's products.
*   **System Components:**
    *   Merchant Portal: Interface for uploading assets, setting brand guidelines, and managing content.
    *   AI Engine: Cloud-based service for narrative generation.
    *   Client Application SDK: Integration point for displaying the dynamic stories.

**Pseudocode (AI Engine - Scene Generation):**

```
function generate_scene(user_data, product_feed, brand_guidelines):
  # 1. User Preference Analysis
  preferred_categories = analyze_user_data(user_data)

  # 2. Product Selection
  relevant_products = filter_products(product_feed, preferred_categories)
  selected_products = select_top_n_products(relevant_products, n=3) #Example

  # 3. Asset Retrieval
  background_images = retrieve_images(brand_guidelines, category=preferred_categories)
  video_clips = retrieve_videos(brand_guidelines, category=preferred_categories)

  # 4. Scene Composition
  scene = Scene()
  scene.background = select_random(background_images)
  for product in selected_products:
    scene.add_product(product) #Dynamically render product image
  scene.text_overlay = generate_text_overlay(product)

  # 5.  Narration (Optional)
  if use_narration:
    narration = generate_narration(product)
    scene.add_narration(narration)

  return scene
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple custom interfaces. It aims for immersive and personalized storytelling, turning product showcases into engaging experiences. The dynamic, AI-driven content generation differentiates it from static or pre-designed merchant interfaces. Leverages the existing client application environment to avoid redirection, building a seamless experience.
