## Dynamic Trust Network for Account Recovery & Beyond

**Concept:** Expand the 'real-world relationship' determination beyond static connections and likelihoods, constructing a *dynamic* trust network that adapts based on ongoing user behavior and interaction *outside* the social network. This isn’t just for recovery, but for proactive security and personalized experiences.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Network Construction:**

1.  **Multi-Source Input:** Collect data from the following sources (with user consent, obviously):
    *   **Device Proximity:** Bluetooth/UWB signals between user devices (opt-in).
    *   **Shared Physical Spaces:** Geolocation data (opt-in, coarse granularity) – determine frequent co-location with other users (e.g., work, gym, home).
    *   **Communication Patterns (Outside Network):** Integrate with user-permitted access to phone call logs and SMS metadata (without content access). Identify frequent communication.
    *   **Shared Media Analysis:** Analyze photos/videos for co-occurrence of individuals. Use facial recognition (privacy-respecting) to identify individuals in shared media.
    *   **Public Event Attendance:** User participation in events (concerts, conferences, etc.).
2.  **Weighted Relationship Score:** Assign weights to each data point based on strength of signal & user-defined preferences.  Example: Consistent co-location at a work address carries more weight than a single shared photo.
3.  **Dynamic Graph:** Construct a directed graph representing relationships between users. Node = User. Edge = Relationship Strength (weighted score).  Edges update in near real-time based on incoming data.
4.  **Trust Propagation:** Implement a trust propagation algorithm.  If User A trusts User B, and User B has a strong relationship with User C, a weaker, but non-zero, trust relationship is established between User A and User C.

**II. Account Recovery Enhancement:**

1.  **Adaptive Recovery Group:** Instead of selecting recovery helpers based *solely* on pre-defined connections, dynamically identify users with the *highest combined trust score* and proximity at the time of the account recovery request.
2.  **Tiered Access Codes:** Generate multiple access codes with varying levels of security.  Users with higher trust scores receive more complex/secure codes.
3.  **Behavioral Biometrics Integration:** During account recovery, integrate behavioral biometrics (typing speed, mouse movements) to verify user identity *before* access codes are sent.

**III. Proactive Security Applications:**

1.  **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor the trust network for unusual activity.  Example:  A user suddenly communicating with a previously unknown user with a low trust score triggers a security alert.
2.  **Fraud Prevention:**  Identify potentially fraudulent transactions based on the trust network.  Example:  A transaction originating from a new device is flagged if the user has no established trust relationship with anyone who has used that device.
3.  **Personalized Security Settings:** Adjust security settings based on the user's trust network.  Example: Allow trusted users to unlock the account without access codes in certain situations.

**IV. Pseudocode (Account Recovery Example):**

```
function recoverAccount(userId):
  requestTime = currentTime()
  // 1. Identify potential recovery helpers within a radius of X kilometers
  potentialHelpers = findUsersNear(userId, X)

  // 2. Calculate trust scores for each potential helper
  for each helper in potentialHelpers:
    trustScore = calculateTrustScore(userId, helper)
    helper.trustScore = trustScore

  // 3. Sort helpers by trust score (descending)
  sortedHelpers = sort(sortedHelpers, by trustScore)

  // 4. Select top N helpers (N = user-defined or dynamically adjusted)
  recoveryGroup = sortedHelpers[0:N]

  // 5. Generate access codes (tiered based on trust score)
  for each helper in recoveryGroup:
    codeComplexity = mapTrustScoreToComplexity(helper.trustScore)
    generateAccessCode(helper, codeComplexity)

  // 6. Send codes to helpers
  sendAccessCodes(recoveryGroup)

  // 7. Wait for user input & verify codes
  verifyAccessCodes(user input, recoveryGroup)

  // 8. Grant access if codes match
  grantAccess(userId)
```

**V. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard smartphone hardware (Bluetooth, GPS, sensors)
*   Secure enclaves for storing trust data and access codes
*   Backend servers for graph database management, trust calculation, and communication.
