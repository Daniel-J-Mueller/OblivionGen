**Dynamic Scene Reconstruction & Generative Tagging**

**Concept:** Extend the object recognition beyond static tagging to reconstruct a 3D scene from the image and *generate* potential product tags based on inferred scene context and user preferences.

**Specs:**

1.  **3D Scene Estimation Module:**
    *   Input: 2D image from user post.
    *   Process: Employ a monocular depth estimation model (e.g., MiDaS, DPT) to generate a depth map from the input image.
    *   Output: Point cloud representing the estimated 3D geometry of the scene.
2.  **Semantic Segmentation & Object Classification:**
    *   Input: 2D image and estimated point cloud.
    *   Process: Utilize a semantic segmentation model (e.g., Mask R-CNN) to identify and segment objects in the image. Classify each segment based on known product categories (from the existing product catalog) *and* inferred object types (e.g., ‘chair’, ‘table’, ‘lamp’).
    *   Output: List of segmented objects with associated classifications and 3D bounding box estimations.
3.  **Contextual Relationship Inference:**
    *   Input: Segmented objects, 3D bounding boxes, and scene geometry.
    *   Process: Analyze the spatial relationships between objects (e.g., “lamp is on table”, “chair is near table”). This is done via a graph neural network (GNN) to model the scene as a graph where nodes are objects and edges represent spatial relationships.
    *   Output: Scene graph representing contextual relationships between objects.
4.  **Generative Tagging Module:**
    *   Input: Scene graph, user's product catalog, user profile (purchase history, browsing data).
    *   Process: A generative model (e.g., a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model) is trained to generate potential product tags.
        *   The model receives the scene graph and user profile as input.
        *   It generates a sequence of tags, prioritizing tags that:
            *   Match products in the user's catalog.
            *   Are relevant to the identified objects and scene context.
            *   Align with the user's preferences (based on purchase history, browsing data).
    *   Output: Ranked list of generated tags with associated confidence scores.

5. **User Interface Integration:**

    *   Present the generated tags to the user, allowing them to:
        *   Accept or reject suggested tags.
        *   Edit tags.
        *   Explore related products.
        *   Provide feedback on tag relevance.
6. **Data Pipeline:**

    *   Continuously collect user feedback on generated tags to refine the generative model.
    *   Expand the product catalog with new products and product categories.
    *   Update user profiles with new purchase history and browsing data.

**Pseudocode (Generative Tagging Module):**

```
function generate_tags(scene_graph, user_catalog, user_profile):
  # Encode scene graph and user profile into vector representations
  scene_embedding = encode_scene_graph(scene_graph)
  user_embedding = encode_user_profile(user_profile)

  # Combine embeddings
  combined_embedding = concatenate(scene_embedding, user_embedding)

  # Generate tag sequence using Transformer model
  tag_sequence = transformer_model.generate(combined_embedding)

  # Filter tags to match products in user catalog
  filtered_tags = [tag for tag in tag_sequence if tag in user_catalog]

  # Rank tags based on confidence scores
  ranked_tags = sort_tags(filtered_tags, confidence_scores)

  return ranked_tags
```

This allows for tagging beyond explicit object recognition to infer the context of the image. For example, if the image shows a living room, the system could suggest tags like "modern sofa", "area rug", or "coffee table" based on the inferred style and context, even if those objects are not explicitly identified in the image.
