## Dynamic Persona Stitching for Conversational Agents

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple user profiles to create *dynamic personas* assembled during a conversation, influencing filler selection and complete responses. This allows the agent to adapt its 'personality' in real-time, fostering more engaging and natural interactions.

**Specifications:**

**I. Persona Component Library:**

*   **Data Structure:**  A JSON-based library of ‘Persona Components’. Each component represents a personality trait, demographic attribute, or conversational style.
    ```json
    {
      "component_id": "humor_dry",
      "name": "Dry Humor",
      "description": "Utilizes understated wit and sarcasm.",
      "filler_keywords": ["sarcasm", "understatement", "irony"],
      "response_style": "concise, witty, avoid excessive enthusiasm",
      "lexical_preferences": ["'as if'", "'sure'", "'well'"],
      "weight": 0.7 //Relative weighting for combination.
    }
    ```
*   **Component Categories:** Include:
    *   Humor Style (dry, slapstick, observational, etc.)
    *   Formality Level (formal, informal, colloquial)
    *   Emotional Tone (optimistic, pessimistic, neutral, empathetic)
    *   Subject Matter Expertise (sports, technology, art, history)
    *   Regional Dialect (based on identified location – optional)

**II.  Real-Time Persona Assembly:**

1.  **Initial Assessment:** Upon first user input, perform a basic sentiment analysis and topic extraction. Assign a baseline persona composed of neutral components.
2.  **Input Analysis:**  For each subsequent user input:
    *   **Sentiment Detection:** Determine the emotional tone of the input.
    *   **Linguistic Feature Extraction:** Identify key linguistic features:
        *   Use of slang/colloquialisms
        *   Complexity of sentence structure
        *   Vocabulary choices
        *   Use of emojis/punctuation
    *   **Topic Alignment:** Determine if the input aligns with any specific topic areas.
3.  **Component Scoring:** Based on the analysis, assign scores to each Persona Component based on its relevance to the current user input.
    *   **Sentiment Match:**  Components aligned with the user’s sentiment receive higher scores.
    *   **Linguistic Similarity:** Components that mirror the user’s language style receive higher scores.
    *   **Topic Affinity:** Components related to the current topic receive higher scores.
4.  **Persona Blending:**  Combine the top-scoring Persona Components, weighted by their scores, to create a dynamic persona profile.  Limit the number of active components to prevent overwhelming the system.
5.  **Filler & Response Adaptation:**
    *   **Filler Selection:** Prioritize conversational fillers associated with the active Persona Components.  (See example from Component Library above).
    *   **Response Style:** Adjust the agent’s response style (tone, vocabulary, sentence structure) to match the dynamic persona profile.

**III. System Architecture**

*   **Persona Manager Module:** Responsible for managing the Persona Component Library, scoring components, and blending personas.
*   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Module:** Existing module, extended to provide detailed linguistic feature extraction.
*   **Response Generation Module:**  Modified to incorporate persona-specific response styles and filler selection.
*   **User Profile Database:** Stores long-term user preferences (optional), used to influence the initial baseline persona.

**Pseudocode – Persona Manager Module (Simplified)**

```
function assemble_persona(user_input):
  sentiment = analyze_sentiment(user_input)
  linguistic_features = extract_linguistic_features(user_input)
  topic = extract_topic(user_input)

  component_scores = {}
  for component in persona_component_library:
    score = 0
    if sentiment matches component.sentiment_preference:
      score += component.sentiment_weight
    if linguistic_features match component.linguistic_profile:
      score += component.linguistic_weight
    if topic matches component.topic:
      score += component.topic_weight

    component_scores[component] = score

  sorted_components = sort_components_by_score(component_scores)
  active_components = top_n_components(sorted_components, 3) // Select top 3

  return active_components
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static user profiles and static filler templates, creating a fluid, adaptable conversational persona. It's not simply about *knowing* the user’s preferences, but *mirroring* their conversational style in real-time, potentially leading to more engaging and natural interactions. This could be particularly effective in applications like virtual therapy, customer service, or creative writing assistance.
