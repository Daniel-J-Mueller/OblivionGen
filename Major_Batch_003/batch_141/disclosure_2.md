## Dynamic Circular Buffer Sharding

**Concept:** Extend the circular buffer concept to a *sharded* architecture, distributing data chunks across multiple physical circular buffers. This allows for increased throughput and parallelism by enabling concurrent access and processing of different data shards.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Sharding Controller:** A dedicated hardware unit responsible for managing the sharded circular buffer. This includes data distribution, access coordination, and shard synchronization.
*   **Multiple Circular Buffers:** N number of physical circular buffers, each with a pre-determined size. These buffers are physically distinct in memory.
*   **DMA Engine:** A high-speed DMA engine capable of concurrently writing to and reading from multiple circular buffers.
*   **Token Aggregator:** A hardware unit to aggregate tokens originating from DMA, indicating data availability across all shards.
*   **Address Mapper:** A lookup table (or logic) which translates logical addresses (used by tensor processors) into physical addresses across the sharded circular buffers.

**2. Data Distribution & Addressing:**

*   **Hashing Function:** A consistent hashing function is used to map data chunks to specific circular buffer shards. The hash function must be deterministic, so the same data chunk always maps to the same shard.
*   **Logical Addressing:** Tensor processors operate using logical addresses that represent the position of data within the entire sharded circular buffer system, *not* within individual shards.
*   **Address Mapping:** The Address Mapper translates logical addresses into a shard ID and an offset within that shard. This requires rapid lookup.
*   **Shard Size:** Shard size (the size of each individual circular buffer) is a configurable parameter.

**3. Operation:**

1.  **Data Input:** The DMA engine receives data chunks and calculates the shard ID using the hashing function.
2.  **Data Placement:** The DMA engine writes the data chunk to the designated circular buffer shard.
3.  **Token Generation:**  The DMA engine generates a token indicating data availability and the corresponding shard ID. This token is sent to the Token Aggregator.
4.  **Token Aggregation:** The Token Aggregator collects tokens from all shards.
5.  **Computation Request:** A tensor processor requests data using a logical address.
6.  **Address Translation:** The Address Mapper translates the logical address into a shard ID and offset.
7.  **Data Retrieval:** The DMA engine reads the data from the designated shard using the offset.
8.  **Computation:** The tensor processor performs the computation.

**4. Pseudocode (Address Mapper):**

```
function translate_logical_to_physical(logical_address):
  shard_id = hash(logical_address) % num_shards
  offset = logical_address / shard_size
  physical_address = shard_id * shard_size + offset
  return physical_address, shard_id
```

**5. Enhancements:**

*   **Dynamic Resharding:**  Implement a mechanism for dynamically redistributing data across shards based on access patterns. This could involve a background task that migrates data during periods of low activity.
*   **Erasure Coding:**  Integrate erasure coding techniques to provide data redundancy and fault tolerance. This would allow the system to continue operating even if one or more shards fail.
*   **Priority Sharding:** Prioritize certain data chunks by assigning them to shards with lower latency or higher bandwidth. This could be useful for critical data that needs to be accessed quickly.

**6. Considerations:**

*   The hashing function needs to be carefully chosen to ensure even distribution of data across shards.
*   The Address Mapper needs to be implemented efficiently to minimize latency.
*   Synchronization between shards may be necessary to maintain data consistency.
