## Dynamic Event Contextualization via Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion

**Concept:** Expand beyond user/event vector embeddings to incorporate real-time contextual data derived from multi-modal sensors to refine event relevance scoring. This isn’t just *about* an event, but *the event as it’s happening, relative to the user's immediate surroundings*.

**Specs:**

**1. Sensor Integration Module:**

*   **Input:** Data streams from:
    *   User device sensors (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, camera, Bluetooth beacons)
    *   Publicly available sensor data (weather, traffic, air quality, noise levels)
    *   Event venue sensors (IoT devices monitoring crowd density, temperature, lighting, sound) – *requires venue partnership/data access*
*   **Processing:**
    *   Sensor data pre-processing (noise filtering, outlier removal, data normalization).
    *   Feature extraction: Derive features like user movement speed/direction, ambient sound levels, visual scene analysis (object detection – crowd, stage, etc.), location accuracy, proximity to event venue.
    *   Data fusion:  Combine sensor data using weighted averaging or Kalman filtering to create a unified contextual representation. Weights adjusted based on sensor reliability and relevance.

**2. Contextual Embedding Generator:**

*   **Architecture:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) – LSTM or GRU – to model the temporal dynamics of contextual data.  A convolutional neural network (CNN) to process visual information from the camera.
*   **Input:** Processed sensor data from the Sensor Integration Module.
*   **Output:**  A high-dimensional vector embedding representing the user’s current context. This is *separate* from the user/event embeddings.

**3.  Dynamic Relevance Scoring:**

*   **Input:**
    *   User embedding (from the original patent’s first neural network)
    *   Event embedding (from the original patent’s second neural network)
    *   Contextual embedding (from the Contextual Embedding Generator)
*   **Processing:**
    *   Concatenate or combine (attention mechanisms) the three embeddings into a single representation.
    *   Pass the combined representation through a fully connected neural network to predict a dynamic relevance score.
*   **Output:** A score indicating the relevance of the event *at that specific moment* given the user's context.

**4.  Adaptive Thresholding & Notification:**

*   Implement an adaptive threshold for the relevance score based on user preferences and historical data.
*   Trigger notifications to users when the score exceeds the threshold, providing event details and location-aware directions.



**Pseudocode (Dynamic Relevance Scoring):**

```
function calculate_dynamic_relevance(user_embedding, event_embedding, context_embedding):
    combined_embedding = concatenate(user_embedding, event_embedding, context_embedding)
    # OR use attention mechanism to weight embeddings

    relevance_score = fully_connected_neural_network(combined_embedding)

    return relevance_score
```

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond static user/event matching to incorporate real-time, multi-sensory context.  This allows for more precise and timely event recommendations, enhancing user engagement and event discovery. A user might be highly likely to attend a concert *in general*, but not if they are currently stuck in traffic, or if the venue is dangerously overcrowded. This system aims to capture those nuances.
