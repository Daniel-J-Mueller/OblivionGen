## Multi-Precision Sparse Matrix Accumulator

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of splitting values across multiple elements, but focus on *sparse* matrices and allow for dynamic precision scaling during accumulation. This moves beyond fixed bit widths and facilitates extremely high dynamic range in the summed result.

**Specification:**

*   **Data Structure:**  Sparse matrix representation employing a compressed sparse row (CSR) or similar format.  Each non-zero element is represented by a base value (floating point, or fixed point) and a set of 'exponent shards'.
*   **Exponent Shards:** Instead of storing the full value in a fixed number of bits, the exponent is split across multiple physical storage locations (akin to the original patent's split segments), offering a variable bit-width representation. The number of exponent shards used *per element* is dynamic, determined by the magnitude of the element's base value.
*   **Accumulation Hardware:** A dedicated hardware unit designed to perform accumulation of these fragmented, variable-precision values.
    *   **Shard Gatherer:**  Collects the exponent shards associated with each element being accumulated.
    *   **Dynamic Exponent Reconstruction:**  Reconstructs the full exponent from the gathered shards.  This reconstruction happens *before* the base values are multiplied.
    *   **Scaled Multiplication:** Performs a multiplication of the base values, scaling the result appropriately based on the reconstructed exponent.
    *   **Accumulator:** Sums the scaled products.  The accumulator itself supports a very wide dynamic range (e.g., 80-bit or 128-bit floating point).
    *   **Shard Propagation:**  After accumulation, the resulting value is fragmented into exponent shards. These shards are propagated to subsequent accumulation steps.

**Pseudocode (Accumulation Step):**

```
function accumulate(base_value_A, base_value_B):
  exponent_shards_A = get_exponent_shards(base_value_A)
  exponent_shards_B = get_exponent_shards(base_value_B)

  reconstructed_exponent_A = reconstruct_exponent(exponent_shards_A)
  reconstructed_exponent_B = reconstruct_exponent(exponent_shards_B)

  combined_exponent = reconstructed_exponent_A + reconstructed_exponent_B

  scaled_product = base_value_A * base_value_B * scale_factor(combined_exponent)

  return scaled_product
```

**Hardware Components:**

1.  **Shard Memory:** High-bandwidth memory dedicated to storing the exponent shards.
2.  **Shard Gather Units:** Parallel units to fetch exponent shards from shard memory.
3.  **Exponent Reconstruction Engines:** Digital circuits optimized for exponent reconstruction.
4.  **Scaled Multiply-Accumulate Units:**  Hardware multipliers with integrated scaling logic.
5.  **Shard Propagation Network:**  A fast interconnect to route exponent shards to subsequent accumulation steps.

**Use Cases:**

*   **Scientific Computing:**  Simulations involving extremely wide dynamic range (e.g., molecular dynamics, fluid dynamics).
*   **Machine Learning:**  Training of deep neural networks with high precision requirements.
*   **Signal Processing:**  Applications where maintaining signal fidelity across a large dynamic range is critical.
*   **Financial Modeling:**  Complex calculations involving a wide range of values.
