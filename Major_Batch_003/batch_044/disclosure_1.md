## Dynamic Card Composition via Generative Audio

**Specification:** Integrate generative audio capabilities into the card generation system described in patent 11436521. Instead of relying solely on visual content (images, videos) within cards, synthesize short-form audio clips *dynamically* based on the predicted user intent and page content. 

**Core Innovation:**  Move beyond visual card composition to *auditory* card composition, enriching the user experience and potentially providing accessibility benefits.

**System Components:**

1.  **Audio Synthesis Engine:** A neural network-based audio generation model (e.g., WaveNet, SampleRNN, or a diffusion model like AudioLM) capable of producing short, contextually relevant audio clips (1-5 seconds). This model is trained on a large dataset of sounds, music, and spoken word content.
2.  **Intent-to-Audio Mapping:** A separate machine learning model that translates the predicted user intent (derived from the first machine learning model in the patent) into a set of audio parameters (e.g., genre, mood, instruments, voice characteristics).  This model acts as a bridge between predicted action and suitable sound design.
3.  **Page Content Analysis Module:**  A natural language processing (NLP) component that analyzes the text content of the page being viewed. This module extracts keywords and themes to further inform the audio synthesis process.
4.  **Card Composition Engine (Augmented):** The existing card generation engine is modified to include an audio stream generation step.  This step utilizes the Intent-to-Audio Mapping and Page Content Analysis Module to generate appropriate audio parameters, which are then fed into the Audio Synthesis Engine.
5.  **Card Rendering Module (Augmented):** The card rendering module now supports embedding an audio player within the card. The player automatically plays the generated audio clip when the card is displayed to the user.

**Pseudocode (Card Generation Process):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateCard(user, page, predictedActions, rankedCardTypes):
    // Existing card generation logic (as described in the patent)

    // 1. Analyze page content
    pageKeywords = AnalyzePageContent(page)

    // 2. Map predicted intent and page keywords to audio parameters
    audioParams = MapIntentToAudio(predictedActions, pageKeywords)

    // 3. Generate audio clip
    audioClip = GenerateAudio(audioParams)

    // 4. Create card with audio player
    card = CreateCard(rankedCardTypes, audioClip) //Embed audio player in card

    RETURN card
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Large dataset of audio samples with associated tags (genre, mood, instruments, themes).
*   Labeled dataset of user intent and corresponding preferred audio styles.
*   Dataset of page content and corresponding suitable audio themes.

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Enhanced Product Discovery:** Generate audio "previews" of products (e.g., a short musical jingle for a clothing item, a sound effect for a tool).
*   **Improved Accessibility:** Provide auditory cues for users with visual impairments.
*   **Increased Engagement:**  Create a more immersive and engaging user experience.
*   **Contextual Notifications:** Use audio to draw attention to important updates or recommendations.
