## Dynamic Ephemeral Avatar Synthesis

**Core Concept:** Extend the ephemeral slide concept by replacing static representative images with dynamically generated avatars that *react* to content and user interaction, further enhancing the feeling of a live, personalized digest. The avatar's appearance and behavior should evolve over the digest’s lifespan, mirroring content decay and user engagement.

**Specifications:**

*   **Avatar Generation Module:**
    *   Input: Content object data (text, images, metadata), content category, user affinity scores, current time within the digest’s lifespan.
    *   Process: Utilizes a generative adversarial network (GAN) or similar deep learning model to synthesize a unique avatar. Avatar parameters (appearance, animation style, emotional expression) are modulated by the input data.
    *   Output: Avatar model (3D mesh, texture maps, animation parameters).

*   **Emotional State Engine:**
    *   Input: Content sentiment analysis results (positive, negative, neutral), user interaction data (gestures, voice commands, dwell time), current time within the digest lifespan.
    *   Process: Maps sentiment and interaction data to emotional states (e.g., happy, sad, curious, frustrated). Determines avatar’s facial expressions, body language, and overall demeanor based on the current emotional state. Emotional states should also decay over time, mirroring the ephemeral nature of the digest.
    *   Output: Emotional state parameters (e.g., happiness level, anger level, curiosity level).

*   **Behavioral Animation Module:**
    *   Input: Emotional state parameters, content type, user interaction data.
    *   Process: Selects and blends pre-defined animation clips (e.g., nodding, shaking head, pointing, waving) based on the current emotional state and content type. Adapts animation speed and intensity based on user interaction. For example, if the user dwells on a particular slide, the avatar could perform a more detailed explanation or gesture towards relevant information.
    *   Output: Animation parameters (e.g., animation clip ID, animation speed, animation intensity).

*   **Digest Integration:**
    *   Replace static representative images on slides with dynamically generated avatars.
    *   Bind avatar animation and behavior to the digest’s lifespan. As slides are removed, the avatar’s emotional state should gradually decline, indicating the approaching end of the digest.
    *   Implement gesture recognition to allow users to interact with the avatar. For example, a user could ask the avatar to repeat a summary, provide more details, or remove a particular slide.

*   **Technical Details:**
    *   Programming Languages: Python, C++
    *   Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
    *   3D Modeling & Animation Tools: Blender, Maya
    *   Real-time Rendering Engine: Unity, Unreal Engine

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each content object in the digest:
    // 1. Analyze content to determine sentiment and key themes.
    // 2. Determine user affinity score for the content object.
    // 3. Generate avatar model using GAN, parameterized by content sentiment, user affinity, and current digest lifespan.
    // 4. Map content sentiment and user interaction data to emotional state parameters.
    // 5. Select and blend animation clips based on emotional state and content type.
    // 6. Render avatar on slide, animating it in real-time based on user interaction.

// Digest Lifespan Management:
    // As time progresses:
        // Decrease overall digest lifespan counter.
        // Gradually reduce avatar’s emotional state, reflecting content decay.
        // Remove slides according to predetermined time schedule.
