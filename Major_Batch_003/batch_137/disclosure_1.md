## Dynamic Precision Weighting with Granular Bit-Swapping

**Concept:** Expand the MSB/LSB tile approach to a more dynamic, granular system where bit-swapping isn't fixed at 4-bit boundaries.  Instead, utilize a per-tensor-element precision map that dictates how many bits are allocated to the MSB/LSB portions *during* the BMM operation. This enables adaptive precision, optimizing for both performance and accuracy.

**Specs:**

*   **Precision Map Tensor:** Introduce a new tensor, the 'Precision Map Tensor' (PMT), the same dimensions as the second activation tensor.  Each element in the PMT defines the number of bits (1-7) to be allocated to the MSB tile for that corresponding element in the second activation tensor.
*   **Bit-Swapping Unit (BSU):** Implement a Bit-Swapping Unit within each Tensor Processor Unit. The BSU takes an element from the second activation tensor *and* the corresponding element from the PMT as input. It then dynamically splits the activation tensor element into MSB and LSB portions based on the PMT value.
*   **Adaptive Weight Buffer Format:**  The weight buffer within each TPU is divided into MSB and LSB sections. The depth of these sections is not fixed but determined by the maximum PMT value across all tensor elements processed by that TPU.
*   **PMT Broadcast:** A dedicated broadcast network distributes the PMT to all BSUs across the tensor processor cluster.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  BMM request initiated.
    2.  PMT broadcast to all TPUs.
    3.  Second activation tensor elements and corresponding PMT elements fed into BSUs.
    4.  BSUs split elements into MSB/LSB tiles based on PMT.
    5.  MSB/LSB tiles loaded into respective weight buffer sections.
    6.  BMM calculation proceeds using MSB/LSB data.

**Pseudocode (BSU operation):**

```
function split_element(activation_element, precision_map_element):
    bit_count = precision_map_element
    msb_mask = (1 << bit_count) - 1 
    lsb_mask = 255 - msb_mask

    msb_tile = (activation_element & msb_mask) << (8-bit_count) # shift MSB to high bits
    lsb_tile = activation_element & lsb_mask

    return msb_tile, lsb_tile
```

**Rationale:**

This dynamic system allows for fine-grained control over precision. By allocating more bits to critical elements and fewer to less sensitive ones, we can reduce computational cost and memory bandwidth without significantly impacting accuracy. The PMT itself could be generated by a pre-processing step, potentially leveraging quantization-aware training.  This offers an additional layer of optimization beyond static precision adjustments. The broadcast system could be parallelized to minimize overhead.
