## Dynamic Thread Avatars – Reactive Persona System

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple text/graphic overlays within a messaging thread to incorporate dynamic, reactive avatars representing individual users, influenced by message content *and* thread-wide emotional state.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Avatar Core:** Each user possesses a base avatar (image/3D model). This is the starting point.
2.  **Emotion Engine:** A real-time emotion analysis module processes incoming messages.  This could be a simple keyword analysis (positive/negative words) or a more complex sentiment analysis leveraging NLP.
3.  **Reaction Parameters:**
    *   **Facial Expressions:**  Based on emotion analysis, the avatar's facial expression changes (happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.). Intensity is proportional to the strength of the detected emotion.
    *   **Color Shift:** Avatar's color palette subtly shifts based on the *dominant* emotional tone of the entire thread. If the thread is predominantly positive, the avatar becomes brighter/warmer. Negative = darker/cooler.
    *   **Particle Effects:**  Emotional spikes trigger brief, visually distinct particle effects around the avatar (e.g., sparkles for joy, dark smoke for anger).
    *   **Posture/Animation:** (For 3D Avatars) Body language changes to reflect emotion - slumping for sadness, confident stance for happiness.
4.  **Content-Specific Reactions:** 
    *   **Keyword Triggers:** Certain keywords trigger specific, pre-defined animations or visual effects (e.g., typing animation when someone mentions "writing," a waving hand when someone says "hello"). This is separate from overall emotion.
    *   **Media Integration:** If a user shares an image or video, the avatar reacts to the content (e.g., looks at the image, appears shocked or amused).
5.  **Thread-Wide Influence:** The overall emotional state of the thread (calculated as an average of all user emotions) affects *all* avatars. A heated argument will cause all avatars to display a degree of agitation.
6.  **User Control:** Users can adjust the *sensitivity* of their avatar’s reactions (e.g., low sensitivity = subtle changes, high sensitivity = exaggerated reactions). They can also choose a “static” mode to disable reactions entirely.
7.  **Data Structure (Simplified):**

```
UserAvatar {
    avatar_id: INT
    base_model: STRING (path to model)
    sensitivity: FLOAT (0.0 - 1.0)
    current_emotion: {
        anger: FLOAT,
        joy: FLOAT,
        sadness: FLOAT,
        fear: FLOAT,
        surprise: FLOAT
    }
    active_animation: STRING (animation name)
}

ThreadState {
    thread_id: INT
    dominant_emotion: {
        anger: FLOAT,
        joy: FLOAT,
        sadness: FLOAT,
        fear: FLOAT,
        surprise: FLOAT
    }
}
```

8. **Pseudocode (Emotion Update):**

```
function updateEmotion(message, user) {
  sentiment = analyzeSentiment(message) // Returns emotion weights
  user.current_emotion = combineEmotions(user.current_emotion, sentiment)

  threadEmotion = updateThreadEmotion(threadEmotion, sentiment)

  animation = selectAnimation(user.current_emotion, threadEmotion)
  user.active_animation = animation

  applyAnimationToAvatar(user.active_animation, user.avatar)
}

function updateThreadEmotion(threadEmotion, sentiment) {
  // Blend sentiment weights into threadEmotion
  return blendedEmotion
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Personalized Avatars:** Allow users to create fully customized avatars.
*   **Emotional Soundscapes:** Trigger ambient sounds based on thread emotion.
*   **Avatar Interactions:** Implement simple avatar-to-avatar interactions (e.g., avatars nodding in agreement).
