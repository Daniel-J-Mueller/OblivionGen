## Adaptive Multi-Stream Prioritization & Dynamic Splitting

**Concept:** Extend the bitrate adaptation beyond a single stream. Instead of focusing solely on adjusting the bitrate of *one* media stream, dynamically prioritize and split a single incoming high-bandwidth stream into multiple, individually adaptable substreams, each optimized for different network conditions or receiver capabilities.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** High-bandwidth media stream (video, AR/VR, multi-sensor data) via standard interface (USB, Ethernet, etc.).
*   **Processor:** Multi-core processor with dedicated hardware acceleration for encoding/decoding various codecs.
*   **Memory:** High-bandwidth RAM (minimum 32GB) to handle multiple concurrent streams.
*   **Network Interface:** Gigabit Ethernet with QoS support. Wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi 6E/7) optional.
*   **Output:** Multiple independent streams, each with adjustable bitrate, resolution, and codec.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Stream Analysis:** Incoming stream is analyzed for content type, resolution, framerate, and complexity.
2.  **Dynamic Splitting:** Stream is dynamically split into multiple substreams. Splitting strategy is determined by available bandwidth, receiver capabilities, and content characteristics. For example:
    *   **Spatial Splitting:** Divide a high-resolution video into multiple regions, each streamed independently. This allows focusing bandwidth on areas of interest (e.g., a speaker's face in a video conference).
    *   **Temporal Splitting:** Extract keyframes or motion vectors and stream them as a separate, low-bandwidth stream for preview or synchronization.
    *   **Layered Encoding:** Encode the stream with multiple layers (base layer + enhancement layers) allowing receivers to decode only the base layer if bandwidth is limited.
3.  **Independent Bitrate Adaptation:** Each substream is assigned its own bitrate control loop, similar to the original patent's approach, but optimized for its specific content and destination.
4.  **Priority Assignment:** Each substream is assigned a priority level (High, Medium, Low) based on its importance. If network congestion occurs, lower-priority streams are throttled or dropped to preserve the quality of higher-priority streams.
5.  **Adaptive Codec Selection:** Each substream can utilize a different codec based on its priority and the receiver's capabilities. For example, a high-priority stream might use a computationally intensive codec like AV1 for maximum quality, while a low-priority stream might use a simpler codec like H.264 for lower latency.
6. **Receiver Feedback Integration:** System actively polls or receives feedback from receivers regarding their available bandwidth and decoding capabilities, adjusting substream parameters in real-time.
7. **Synchronization Mechanism:** Implement a robust synchronization mechanism to ensure that the substreams are properly aligned at the receiver. This could involve timestamping, frame ordering, and interpolation techniques.

**Pseudocode (Bitrate Adaptation Loop):**

```
for each substream:
    monitor network performance (latency, packet loss, bandwidth)
    calculate performance metric (e.g., buffer occupancy, signal strength)
    if performance metric < threshold:
        reduce bitrate
        select lower-resolution codec
        if priority == low:
            drop substream
    else if performance metric > upper_threshold:
        increase bitrate
        select higher-resolution codec
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Live Streaming:** Adaptively stream multiple camera angles or AR overlays to viewers with varying bandwidth.
*   **Virtual/Augmented Reality:** Stream different parts of a VR/AR scene to different parts of a headset display, reducing latency and improving visual quality.
*   **Remote Surgery/Robotics:** Stream multiple sensor feeds (video, depth, tactile) with varying priorities and bitrates to a remote operator.
*   **High-Resolution Video Conferencing:** Adaptively stream multiple camera angles and screen shares to participants with varying network conditions.
