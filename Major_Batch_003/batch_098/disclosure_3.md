**Adaptive Prediction Partitioning with Temporal Context**

**Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust residual frame data partitioning *not* based solely on partition size, but on predicted motion vectors and scene complexity from *prior* frames, anticipating areas needing finer granularity before transformation.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Motion Vector Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Decoded motion vectors from the immediately preceding frame (or a short history buffer).
    *   Process: Utilize optical flow algorithms or motion compensation techniques to *predict* motion vectors for the current frame *before* transformation.
    *   Output: A “motion vector field” – a map representing predicted motion for each macroblock/coding unit.

2.  **Complexity Estimation Module:**
    *   Input: Decoded frames (or reconstructed residuals) from the previous N frames.
    *   Process: Calculate a complexity metric – a combined measure of texture, edges, and motion activity – to estimate scene complexity. Utilize a spatial variance filter on the decoded frames, weighted by the motion vector magnitudes. High variance = high complexity.
    *   Output: A “complexity map” – a grid indicating the complexity level of each macroblock/coding unit.

3.  **Adaptive Partitioning Controller:**
    *   Input: Motion vector field, complexity map, target bit rate.
    *   Process:
        *   **Thresholding:** Define thresholds for motion vector magnitude and complexity level.
        *   **Partition Adjustment:**
            *   If a macroblock/coding unit exhibits high motion *and* high complexity, subdivide it into smaller partitions (e.g., 4x4, 8x8) *before* transformation.
            *   If motion is low and complexity is low, use larger partitions (e.g., 16x16, 32x32).
            *   Dynamically adjust thresholds based on the target bit rate – lower thresholds for higher quality/bit rate, and vice versa.
        *   **Partition Map Generation:** Create a partition map indicating the size and arrangement of partitions for the current frame.

4.  **Integration with Existing Pipeline:**
    *   Insert the Adaptive Partitioning Controller *before* the Transformation Module in the existing hardware distortion data pipeline.
    *   The Transformation Module then operates on the data according to the generated partition map.
    *   Ensure the ping-pong buffers are sized to accommodate the dynamically adjusted partition sizes.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each macroblock/coding unit (MCU)
motion_vector = predict_motion_vector(previous_frame, MCU)
complexity = estimate_complexity(previous_frame, MCU)

if (motion_vector.magnitude > high_motion_threshold AND complexity > high_complexity_threshold):
    partition_size = 4x4
elif (motion_vector.magnitude > medium_motion_threshold OR complexity > medium_complexity_threshold):
    partition_size = 8x8
else:
    partition_size = 16x16

generate_partition_map(partition_size)

// Send partitioned data to Transformation Module
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Dedicated processing units for motion vector prediction and complexity estimation.
*   Increased memory bandwidth to handle dynamically sized partitions.
*   Adjustable ping-pong buffer sizes.
*   Parallel processing architecture to handle multiple macroblocks/coding units simultaneously.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved compression efficiency by allocating more bits to complex areas.
*   Reduced distortion in areas with high motion.
*   Adaptability to varying scene content.
*   Enhanced video quality at a given bit rate.
