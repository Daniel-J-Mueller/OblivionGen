## Predictive Transform Unit Granularity

**Specification:** Develop a system to dynamically adjust the granularity of transform unit (TU) analysis based on predicted coding complexity. Instead of uniformly analyzing TUs for skip decisions, pre-estimate coding complexity for each prediction unit (PU) and adjust the TU size used for skip detection accordingly.

**Components:**

1.  **Complexity Estimator:**
    *   Input: PU characteristics (size, motion vector magnitude, residual data variance).
    *   Process: Employ a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., decision tree, small neural network) trained on historical encoding data to predict the probability of non-zero coefficients within the PU.
    *   Output: Complexity Score (0.0 â€“ 1.0). Higher scores indicate greater potential for non-zero coefficients.

2.  **TU Size Adaptor:**
    *   Input: Complexity Score, Maximum TU Size (configurable parameter).
    *   Process: Map the Complexity Score to a TU size. This could be a linear mapping, a step function, or a more complex function. For example:
        *   Score < 0.2: TU Size = 64x64
        *   0.2 <= Score < 0.5: TU Size = 32x32
        *   Score >= 0.5: TU Size = 16x16
    *   Output: Adaptive TU Size.

3.  **Skip Decision Engine (Modified):**
    *   Input: Control Information, Residual Data, Adaptive TU Size.
    *   Process: Perform the existing skip decision logic, but now using the Adaptive TU Size instead of a fixed size.
    *   Output: Actual Skip Decision.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function DetermineAdaptiveTUSize(complexityScore, maxTUSize):
  if complexityScore < 0.2:
    return maxTUSize
  else if complexityScore < 0.5:
    return maxTUSize / 2
  else:
    return maxTUSize / 4

function ProcessPredictionUnit(controlInformation, residualData):
  complexityScore = EstimateComplexity(residualData)
  adaptiveTUSize = DetermineAdaptiveTUSize(complexityScore, 64)

  skipDecision = AnalyzeTUsForSkip(residualData, adaptiveTUSize)

  return skipDecision
```

**Rationale:**

Current systems often use a fixed TU size for skip detection. This is inefficient because PUs with simple content (e.g., large flat regions) can be analyzed with larger TUs, reducing computational cost. Conversely, PUs with complex content require smaller TUs to accurately detect non-zero coefficients. Dynamically adjusting the TU size based on predicted complexity allows for a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.
