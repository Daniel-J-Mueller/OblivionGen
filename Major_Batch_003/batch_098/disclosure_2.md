## Dynamic Prediction Mode Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Implement a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to dynamically adjust the weighting of prediction modes during the mode decision process. Instead of static thresholds or cost functions, the RL agent learns optimal weighting based on observed video characteristics and encoder performance. This allows the system to adapt to diverse content and optimize encoding efficiency beyond traditional rate-distortion optimization.

**System Specifications:**

*   **RL Agent:** A deep Q-network (DQN) or policy gradient agent.
*   **State Space:**
    *   Frame-level statistics: Motion vector magnitude, texture complexity (variance), color saturation, edge density.
    *   Encoder state: Quantization parameters (QP), bit rate, frame type (I, P, B).
    *   Recent prediction mode performance: Average cost (RD or other) of previously selected modes.
*   **Action Space:** Adjustment weights applied to the primary and secondary cost calculations. Each action alters the relative importance of rate vs. distortion. Actions can include:
    *   Increase/Decrease rate weight.
    *   Increase/Decrease distortion weight.
    *   Fine-grained adjustments to specific prediction mode weights (e.g., increase weight for intra prediction in low-motion areas).
*   **Reward Function:**
    *   Primary: Negative Rate-Distortion cost (lower is better).
    *   Secondary: Bitrate stability reward (penalize large bitrate fluctuations between frames).
    *   Tertiary: Perceptual Quality reward (e.g., based on VMAF or similar metric).
*   **Training Procedure:**
    *   Offline training: Train the RL agent using a diverse video dataset.
    *   Online fine-tuning: Allow the agent to continue learning during encoding based on real-time performance.
*   **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   The RL agent operates as a pre-processor to the primary mode decision module.
    *   It outputs adjusted cost weights to the rate-distortion optimization process.
    *   The secondary mode decision module remains largely unchanged.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// During encoding of each frame:
1.  Extract Frame Features (motion, texture, color, etc.)
2.  Observe Encoder State (QP, Bitrate, Frame Type)
3.  RL Agent:
    a.  Receive State (Frame Features + Encoder State)
    b.  Select Action (Adjust Cost Weights)
    c.  Apply Action to Primary and Secondary Mode Decision Modules
4.  Primary Mode Decision Module (with adjusted weights):
    a.  Identify Primary Set of Prediction Modes
5.  Secondary Mode Decision Module:
    a.  Select Optimal Prediction Mode from Primary Set
6.  Encode Frame using Selected Prediction Mode
7.  Calculate Reward (based on Rate-Distortion, Bitrate Stability, Perceptual Quality)
8.  Update RL Agent (using reward and state)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   The RL agent can be implemented on a dedicated accelerator (e.g., FPGA or specialized AI chip) for low-latency inference.
*   The memory bandwidth requirements for accessing frame features and encoder state should be considered.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved encoding efficiency and visual quality.
*   Adaptation to diverse content and encoding scenarios.
*   Robustness to changes in video statistics.
*   Potential for real-time optimization of encoding parameters.
