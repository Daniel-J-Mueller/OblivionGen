**Dynamic Avatar Morphing via Shared Environmental Data**

**Concept:** Extend the common background concept by allowing users to influence *each other's* avatars within the shared environment, creating a form of non-verbal communication and enhanced presence.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Environmental Data Capture:** Each user's client device captures ambient environmental data – light levels, sound (analyzed for emotional tone – e.g., laughter, concern), and even basic facial muscle movement via the device's camera (without full facial capture - just broad emotion indicators).

2.  **Data Transmission & Processing:** This data is transmitted to the online system. The system normalizes and processes it.  Crucially, the system *doesn't* transmit the raw data to other users.  Instead, it generates *avatar modification parameters*.

3.  **Avatar Modification Parameters:** These parameters control subtle changes to other users’ avatars.  Examples:
    *   *Luminance Shift:*  If User A's environment detects a sudden increase in light (e.g., a bright flash), User B’s avatar might subtly brighten as if reflecting the light.
    *   *Color Tint:* User A’s emotional analysis detects sadness. User B's avatar receives a very subtle blue tint.
    *   *Micro-Expression Replication:* If User A displays a subtle smile (detected as a muscle movement), User B's avatar displays a *slightly* delayed and softened version of that smile. *Not* a direct copy.
    *   *Environmental Sound Reflection:* If User A experiences a loud noise, User B’s avatar might have a very slight ‘bounce’ or distortion effect.

4.  **Avatar Engine Integration:** The online system transmits these avatar modification parameters to each client device.  Each client device’s avatar engine applies these parameters *in real-time* to the displayed avatars of other users.

5.  **User Control/Customization:** Users have a control panel to adjust the *intensity* and *type* of these environmental effects.  They can disable certain effects entirely, or set a maximum level of influence. A 'sensitivity' slider for each effect type.

6.  **Template Integration:** The existing template system is extended to include “environmental effect slots” in addition to avatar position slots. These slots define which effects are allowed within a given session/template.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Avatar Rendering):**

```
function RenderAvatar(avatarData, environmentalEffects) {
  // Base avatar rendering using avatarData

  foreach (effect in environmentalEffects) {
    switch (effect.type) {
      case "LUMINANCE_SHIFT":
        avatarColor = adjustLuminance(avatarColor, effect.intensity);
        break;
      case "COLOR_TINT":
        avatarColor = tintColor(avatarColor, effect.color, effect.intensity);
        break;
      case "MICRO_EXPRESSION":
        avatarFace.applySlightSmile(effect.intensity); //subtle expression
        break;
      case "SOUND_REFLECTION":
        avatar.applySlightBounce(effect.intensity);
        break;
    }
  }

  renderAvatarWithModifiedColorAndEffects();
}

//In Main Loop:
environmentalEffects = receiveEffectsFromServer();
foreach(user in otherUsers) {
    RenderAvatar(user.avatarData, environmentalEffects);
}
```

**Engineer Notes:**  Focus on minimizing latency. Effects must be subtle and naturalistic to avoid being jarring or distracting.  Prioritize a flexible avatar engine that can easily accommodate new effect types.  The server-side processing needs to be highly optimized to handle a large number of users.  Consider using procedural animation techniques to create the subtle effects.
