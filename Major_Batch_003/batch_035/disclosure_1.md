**Dynamic Game Difficulty Adjustment via Biofeedback**

**Core Concept:** Integrate real-time biometric data from the user (heart rate variability, skin conductance, EEG) to dynamically adjust the difficulty of games presented within the messaging application. This goes beyond simple difficulty settings; the goal is to maintain a state of “flow” – a balance between challenge and skill – to maximize engagement and enjoyment.

**Specs:**

1.  **Biometric Input:**
    *   Support for integration with wearable sensors (smartwatches, fitness trackers, EEG headsets) via Bluetooth or direct API connection.
    *   Data stream acquisition: Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Skin Conductance (electrodermal activity), basic EEG readings (alpha/beta wave ratios).
    *   Calibration routine: Initial user-specific baseline establishment for each metric.

2.  **Flow State Algorithm:**
    *   `flow_score = w1 * hrv_normalized + w2 * sc_normalized + w3 * eeg_normalized`
    *   `hrv_normalized = (current_hrv - baseline_hrv) / baseline_hrv` (higher HRV generally indicates better stress resilience/flow potential)
    *   `sc_normalized = (current_sc - baseline_sc) / baseline_sc` (Skin conductance indicates arousal/engagement. Moderate levels are ideal)
    *   `eeg_normalized = (current_eeg_alpha - baseline_eeg_alpha) / baseline_eeg_alpha` (Alpha wave ratios can indicate relaxed focus)
    *   Weights `w1`, `w2`, `w3` are tunable parameters, adjustable per game type/user preference.
    *   Thresholds: Define "flow zone" based on `flow_score` range. (e.g., 0.2 < flow\_score < 0.8)

3.  **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment:**
    *   Game API Integration: The messaging app needs an API to communicate difficulty levels to each integrated game.
    *   Adjustment Logic:
        *   If `flow_score` < lower_threshold: Increase game difficulty (e.g., faster enemy speed, more complex puzzles).
        *   If `flow_score` > upper_threshold: Decrease game difficulty.
        *   Adjustment granularity: Small, incremental changes to prevent jarring shifts in experience. (e.g., 5-10% difficulty adjustment per iteration).
        *   Game-specific parameters: Each game will have a mapping between `flow_score` and its internal difficulty settings.
    *   Learning Algorithm: Over time, the system learns the user's optimal difficulty curve for each game, refining the adjustment logic. (e.g., using a simple reinforcement learning approach).

4.  **User Interface:**
    *   Biometric Data Visualization: Optional display of real-time biometric data to the user.
    *   Flow State Indicator: Visual representation of the user’s current flow state (e.g., a color-coded bar).
    *   Adjustment Settings: Allow users to customize the sensitivity of the adjustment algorithm.
    *   Game-Specific Profiles: Users can create difficulty profiles for each game.

5.  **Messaging Integration:**
    *   "Flow Challenge" Feature: Users can challenge friends to games with dynamic difficulty adjustment.
    *   "Flow Score" Sharing: Allow users to share their flow scores with friends.
    *   "Flow Recommendation" Engine: Suggest games based on the user’s flow profile.
