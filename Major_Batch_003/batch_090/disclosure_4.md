## Adaptive Ontological Swarm for Contextual Ambiguity Resolution

**Concept:** Expand the structural ontology beyond a singular, defined structure to a dynamic, self-organizing ‘swarm’ of ontologies. Each ontology instance within the swarm is specialized for a narrow contextual domain, learned from user interactions and external data sources. When a user input arrives, a consensus mechanism within the swarm determines which ontologies are most relevant, blending their interpretations to resolve ambiguities and generate a more nuanced semantic representation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Ontology Swarm Architecture:**

*   **Core Ontology:** A foundational, generalized ontology defining basic actions, objects, and attributes (as in the source patent).  This acts as a starting point.
*   **Specialized Ontologies:**  Numerous smaller ontologies, each focused on a specific domain (e.g., "cooking recipes," "sports scores," "financial news," "travel planning"). These are created/updated via machine learning from a corpus of relevant data.
*   **Swarm Manager:** Responsible for maintaining the swarm, creating new ontologies, pruning redundant ones, and managing resource allocation.
*   **Relevance Engine:**  Evaluates user input and determines the degree of relevance of each ontology within the swarm.  Uses vector embeddings of the input utterance and ontology labels.

**2.  Dynamic Semantic Representation Generation:**

*   **Initial Parsing:** User input is parsed using the Core Ontology to create a preliminary semantic representation.
*   **Swarm Activation:**  The Relevance Engine activates a subset of Specialized Ontologies based on the input's relevance scores.
*   **Semantic Blending:** Each activated ontology generates a candidate semantic representation based on its specialized knowledge.  A weighting mechanism (based on relevance scores and confidence levels) combines these candidates into a unified representation.  This can involve merging objects, refining attributes, or resolving ambiguous actions.
*   **Conflict Resolution:**  A rule-based or machine-learning-driven conflict resolution module handles contradictory interpretations from different ontologies.  Prioritization rules or a probabilistic voting scheme can be employed.

**3.  Learning and Adaptation:**

*   **User Feedback Loop:** User actions (e.g., corrections, confirmations, rephrasing) are used to refine the weights and parameters of the ontologies.
*   **Data Ingestion:**  The swarm continuously ingests data from external sources (e.g., knowledge graphs, APIs, news feeds) to expand its knowledge base and adapt to evolving contexts.
*   **Ontology Evolution:**  The swarm can dynamically create new ontologies or merge/split existing ones based on emerging patterns in user interactions and external data.
*   **Active Learning:** System actively solicits disambiguation from the user when confidence is low.

**Pseudocode (Semantic Blending):**

```
function blend_semantic_representations(core_representation, specialized_representations):
  weighted_representation = {}

  // Initialize with core representation
  weighted_representation = core_representation

  // Iterate through specialized representations
  for each specialized_representation in specialized_representations:
    weight = specialized_representation.relevance_score // From Relevance Engine
    for each entity in specialized_representation:
      if entity in weighted_representation:
        // Merge attributes based on confidence
        weighted_representation[entity].attributes = merge_attributes(weighted_representation[entity].attributes, entity.attributes, weight)
      else:
        weighted_representation[entity] = entity

  return weighted_representation
```

**4. API Integration**
*   Swarm Manager exposes an API for requesting semantic interpretations.
*   Agent can specify a 'context' parameter to bias the swarm toward relevant ontologies.

**Engineer Deliverables:**

*   Swarm Manager service with API.
*   Relevance Engine module.
*   Ontology creation/management tools.
*   Semantic blending/conflict resolution module.
*   User feedback integration mechanism.
*   Testing harness for evaluating swarm performance.
