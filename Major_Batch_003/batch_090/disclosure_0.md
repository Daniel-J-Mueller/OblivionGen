**Dynamic Emotional Resonance Filtering for Video Streams**

**Concept:** Extend the social connection weighting to incorporate real-time emotional analysis of participants.  Instead of *just* prioritizing streams based on social graph proximity, dynamically adjust stream quality/visibility based on perceived emotional resonance between viewers and speakers.  The goal is to create a more emotionally engaging and impactful video conferencing experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Emotional Analysis Module:**  Integrate a real-time emotion detection system (facial expression analysis, voice tone analysis, potentially even physiological data from wearable sensors – optional). This module outputs an “Emotional Resonance Score” (ERS) for each participant pair (viewer-speaker). Scale: 0-100. Higher scores indicate stronger emotional alignment.
*   **Stream Prioritization Algorithm:**
    *   Base Priority:  Initial stream priority is determined by the existing social graph weighting (as described in the provided patent).
    *   ERS Modifier: Apply an ERS modifier to the base priority.  Higher ERS = higher priority.  The magnitude of the modifier is adjustable.
    *   Dynamic Adjustment:  Continuously update the priority based on real-time ERS changes.
    *   Thresholding:  Implement thresholds for ERS.  If ERS falls below a threshold, reduce stream quality (lower resolution, mute audio temporarily) or reduce visibility (smaller window size) for that participant.
*   **User Control:** Allow users to customize the ERS modifier and threshold levels. Offer presets (e.g., “Empathy Focus,” “Efficiency Mode”).
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  Clearly communicate to users that emotional analysis is being performed.  Provide options to disable emotional analysis completely.  Data must be anonymized and aggregated where possible.
*   **Integration with Existing System:**  Designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing video room system described in the patent.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each participant (viewer) in the video room:

For each speaker in the video room:
    emotionalResonanceScore = AnalyzeEmotionalResonance(viewer, speaker) // Returns score 0-100

    basePriority = CalculateBasePriority(viewer, speaker) // Uses social graph data

    priorityModifier = emotionalResonanceScore * sensitivityFactor //sensitivityFactor is a user adjustable variable.

    finalPriority = basePriority + priorityModifier

    if (finalPriority > threshold) {
      DisplaySpeakerStream(speaker, highQuality)
    } else {
      DisplaySpeakerStream(speaker, lowQuality) // or reduced visibility
    }
End For
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Team Collaboration:**  Prioritize streams of team members who are displaying the most engagement and understanding.
*   **Remote Learning:**  Prioritize streams of students who are actively participating and showing comprehension.
*   **Therapy/Counseling:**  Prioritize the stream of the client to allow the therapist to focus on their emotional state.
*   **Live Events/Presentations:**  Prioritize streams of audience members who are displaying the most positive emotions.
