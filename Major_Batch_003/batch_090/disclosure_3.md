## Dynamic Profile "Mood" Generation & Projection

**Concept:** Extend the dating profile generation beyond static information and media by incorporating a "mood" layer. This layer isn't simply sentiment analysis, but a proactive system that *projects* potential moods/vibes the user might convey, and allows them to curate those projections. This goes beyond matching based on stated preferences; it aims for a more intuitive, felt connection.

**Specs:**

*   **Mood Seed Data:** Collect data beyond typical profile info. Gather subtle cues like frequently used emojis, music listening habits (via API integration with streaming services), preferred color palettes (from shared images/posts), and even typing patterns (rhythm, punctuation).

*   **Mood Generation Engine:** A generative AI (likely a diffusion model variant) trained on visual/auditory/textual representations of 'moods'. Inputs are the "Mood Seed Data". Outputs are:
    *   **Visual Mood Boards:** Short (3-5 second) looping videos or animated images. These are *not* photos/videos of the user, but visual representations of the projected mood (e.g., a rainy cityscape for “melancholy”, a vibrant abstract animation for “energetic”).
    *   **Auditory Moodscapes:** Short ambient soundscapes (music snippets, environmental sounds) that complement the visual mood board.
    *   **Textual Mood Statements:**  A few curated sentences (generated or user-edited) that capture the mood.  These aren’t “about me” statements, but evocative phrases (“Lost in thought on a quiet evening”, “Ready for a spontaneous adventure”).

*   **Profile "Mood Carousel":**  The user doesn't have a single dating profile, but a "carousel" of 3-5 "mood profiles". Each mood profile consists of:
    *   The generated Visual Mood Board.
    *   The Auditory Moodscape.
    *   The Textual Mood Statement.
    *   A limited set of contextual information (chosen to align with the mood – e.g., favorite book for “thoughtful”, a travel destination for “adventurous”).

*   **Matching Algorithm Adjustment:** The matching algorithm prioritizes shared "mood affinities" – matching users who consistently express and respond to similar moods.  Users can 'react' to others' mood profiles (e.g., "vibe check," "resonates," "not my energy"), which further refines the matching.

*   **Mood Profile Editing & Control:**
    *   **Mood "Sliders":** Users adjust sliders to emphasize different aspects of their personality/mood (e.g., “Introverted/Extroverted”, “Playful/Serious”, “Creative/Practical”). This influences the generated mood profiles.
    *   **Mood Override:** Users can manually create/upload images/sounds/text for specific mood profiles, completely overriding the generative AI.
    *   **Mood Scheduling:** Users can schedule different mood profiles to be displayed at different times of day, or based on their activity (e.g., a "focused" mood during work hours, a "social" mood in the evening).

**Pseudocode (Mood Generation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION generateMoodProfile(seedData, moodSliders):
  // seedData: Dictionary of user data (emojis, music, colors, etc.)
  // moodSliders: Dictionary of slider values (introverted/extroverted, etc.)

  // 1. Encode seedData into a latent vector
  latentVector = encodeData(seedData)

  // 2. Apply moodSlider adjustments to latentVector
  adjustedLatentVector = applyMoodSliders(latentVector, moodSliders)

  // 3. Decode adjustedLatentVector into visual/auditory/textual components
  visualMoodBoard = decodeVisual(adjustedLatentVector)
  auditoryMoodscape = decodeAudio(adjustedLatentVector)
  textualMoodStatement = decodeText(adjustedLatentVector)

  // 4. Return the generated mood profile
  RETURN (visualMoodBoard, auditoryMoodscape, textualMoodStatement)
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **"Moodcasting"** – Users can "cast" their current mood to their matches, triggering a notification and a brief display of the mood profile.
*   **AR/VR Mood Experiences** –  Extend the mood profiles into immersive AR/VR experiences, allowing matches to "step into" the user's mood.
*   **AI Mood Co-creation:** Allow users to collaborate with an AI to refine and create new mood profiles.
