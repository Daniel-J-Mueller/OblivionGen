## Thermal Gradient Mapping & Predictive Failure Analysis System

**Concept:** Expand the thermal testing system beyond simple property determination to create a dynamic thermal map of a component *during* operation, predicting potential failure points *before* they occur. This leverages the existing heating element and thermal sensor but adds significantly more complexity in data acquisition and analysis.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Replace the single thermal sensor with a dense array of micro-thermal sensors (e.g., thermistors, thermocouples, or infrared sensors) embedded within a flexible, conformable material. This array will be designed to adhere directly to the target component's surface. Sensor pitch: 1mm-5mm, depending on component size and resolution requirements.
*   **Multi-Zone Heating Element:**  Divide the existing heating element into multiple independently controlled zones.  Each zone will correspond to a region of the target component with varying power dissipation.  Control granularity: 10mm x 10mm zones.
*   **High-Speed Data Acquisition:** Implement a high-speed data acquisition system capable of sampling all sensors in the array at a rate of at least 100 Hz.  Synchronize data acquisition with the heating element control signals.  Minimum sampling rate: 200Hz
*   **Dynamic Thermal Model:** Develop a dynamic thermal model of the target component based on its physical dimensions, material properties, and expected power dissipation profile.  This model will be used to predict the temperature distribution across the component under different operating conditions.
*   **Anomaly Detection Algorithm:** Implement an anomaly detection algorithm that compares the measured temperature distribution to the predicted temperature distribution.  This algorithm will identify areas where the measured temperature deviates significantly from the predicted temperature, indicating a potential failure point. Machine learning model to be trained on known failure modes.
*   **Predictive Failure Analysis:** Integrate the anomaly detection algorithm with a predictive failure analysis engine. This engine will use historical data, environmental factors, and operational parameters to estimate the remaining useful life of the component and identify potential failure modes. Output should include probability of failure and estimated time to failure.
*   **Software Interface:** Develop a user-friendly software interface that displays the thermal map, anomaly detection results, and predictive failure analysis data in real-time. Interface to include 3D visualization of thermal gradient and customizable alert thresholds.
*    **Automated Calibration:**  Implement a self-calibration routine that verifies sensor accuracy and compensates for variations in environmental conditions. Utilize a reference blackbody source for absolute temperature measurement.
*   **Power Control Protocol:**  Implement a variable-power control protocol for the heating element, enabling simulated workloads with dynamic power draw profiles. Utilize PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for precise control.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
// Input: Measured temperature array (T_measured), Predicted temperature array (T_predicted)
// Output: Anomaly score (0-1, 1 indicating high anomaly)

function detect_anomaly(T_measured, T_predicted):

    // Calculate temperature difference array
    delta_T = T_measured - T_predicted

    // Calculate Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    RMSE = sqrt(mean(delta_T^2))

    // Calculate Standard Deviation of Temperature Difference
    std_dev = standard_deviation(delta_T)

    // Normalize RMSE and Standard Deviation
    RMSE_normalized = RMSE / max_expected_RMSE
    std_dev_normalized = std_dev / max_expected_std_dev

    // Combine Normalized Metrics to Calculate Anomaly Score
    anomaly_score = (RMSE_normalized + std_dev_normalized) / 2

    return anomaly_score
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   The sensor array material needs to be flexible and have good thermal conductivity.
*   The data acquisition system needs to be robust and capable of handling a large amount of data in real-time.
*   The dynamic thermal model needs to be accurate and representative of the target component.
*   Machine learning model requires significant training data.
*   Power consumption of the test system itself must be minimized.
