## Adaptive Data Prefetching via Predictive Coherency

**Concept:** Enhance memory access latency reduction by proactively prefetching data not just based on access patterns, but on *predicted* coherency state changes. The existing patent focuses on coherency *support*. This expands on that by *predicting* coherency needs to reduce latency further.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Coherency Engine (PCE):** A dedicated hardware module integrated into the controller device alongside the existing interconnect protocol & memory/storage controllers.

   *   **Input:** Real-time data operation requests, interconnect bus traffic analysis (coherency messages – read/write acknowledgements, invalidations), historical access patterns, and application metadata (if available).
   *   **Core:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained to predict future coherency state changes.  The RNN would model the relationships between data addresses, access types (read/write), and the probability of needing a specific coherency action (e.g., acquiring exclusive ownership, invalidating a cache line).
   *   **Output:** Prefetch requests with associated coherency hints (e.g., "prefetch with intent to write," "prefetch for read-sharing," "invalidate remote caches").

**2. Adaptive Prefetch Queue (APQ):** A dedicated hardware queue integrated within the memory/storage controller.

   *   **Input:** Prefetch requests from the PCE, standard data operation requests.
   *   **Functionality:** Prioritizes prefetch requests based on the coherency hints received from the PCE.  Prefetch requests with "intent to write" hints receive the highest priority, followed by requests for read-sharing. Standard data operation requests are served based on traditional queueing algorithms (e.g., First-In, First-Out, Least Recently Used).
   *   **Dynamic Allocation:** The APQ dynamically allocates resources (queue slots, bandwidth) to prefetch requests based on the predicted coherency needs.

**3. Coherency Hint Encoding:**

   *   **Data Structure:** A small metadata tag (e.g., 4-8 bits) appended to each prefetch request.
   *   **Encoding:**
      *   Bit 0-1: Prefetch Type (Data, Instruction)
      *   Bit 2-3: Coherency Intent (None, Read-Share, Exclusive-Write)
      *   Bit 4-5: Confidence Level (Low, Medium, High – based on the RNN’s output probability)

**4.  Training Methodology:**

   *   **Dataset:** A large corpus of application workloads, capturing diverse access patterns and coherency behaviors.
   *   **Training Algorithm:** Supervised learning, using the historical access patterns as training data. The RNN is trained to predict the correct coherency action (e.g., acquire, invalidate) based on the previous access history.
   *   **Online Adaptation:** Continuously retrain the RNN in real-time, using the observed coherency events. This allows the system to adapt to changing application workloads and improve its prediction accuracy over time.

**5. Pseudocode (PCE Core):**

```
function predict_coherency(access_history, current_address):
  input_sequence = access_history + [current_address]
  rnn_output = RNN(input_sequence)
  coherency_probabilities = softmax(rnn_output) // Probability distribution over coherency actions
  predicted_action = argmax(coherency_probabilities)
  confidence_level = max(coherency_probabilities)
  return predicted_action, confidence_level
```

**6. Error Handling:**

   *   **Confidence Threshold:** If the RNN's confidence level falls below a certain threshold, the prefetch request is treated as a standard request without any coherency hints.
   *   **Invalidation Recovery:** If a prefetch request is invalidated before it can be serviced, the system dynamically adjusts its prediction model to avoid similar errors in the future.
