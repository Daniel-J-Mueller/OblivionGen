## Dynamic Dataflow Graph Partitioning for Heterogeneous Acceleration

**Concept:** Extend the existing chiplet-based system to actively reshape dataflow graphs at runtime, optimizing for both performance and power based on observed workload characteristics. The initial patent focuses on *how* to decode, preprocess, and encode—this builds on that to determine *what* to decode, preprocess, and encode, and *where* to do it—dynamically.

**System Specs:**

*   **Runtime Graph Compiler:** A software module integrated into the host CPU. This module accepts a high-level representation of the video processing pipeline (e.g., a dataflow graph) as input.
*   **Workload Profiler:** Hardware performance counters on both the CPU and accelerator(s) provide real-time data on execution bottlenecks, power consumption, and resource utilization.
*   **Partitioning Engine:** The core algorithmic component. It analyzes the workload profile and the dataflow graph, then re-partitions the graph’s operations across the CPU and accelerator(s).  The partitioning prioritizes operations based on:
    *   **Data Dependency:** Minimize data transfer between chiplets.
    *   **Computational Intensity:** Offload computationally intensive kernels to the accelerator.
    *   **Memory Bandwidth:** Balance memory access across CPU and accelerator.
    *   **Power Constraints:** Limit accelerator usage during power-sensitive operations.
*   **Dynamic Interconnect Manager:** A hardware component that manages the die-to-die interconnect, dynamically re-routing data paths to match the re-partitioned graph.
*   **Adaptive Memory Controller:**  Manages the unified memory pool, prioritizing memory access based on the re-partitioned graph and minimizing contention.

**Pseudocode (Partitioning Engine):**

```
function partitionGraph(dataflowGraph, workloadProfile, powerBudget) {
  // 1. Analyze workload profile to identify bottlenecks and power consumption.
  bottlenecks = identifyBottlenecks(workloadProfile);
  powerUsage = getPowerUsage(workloadProfile);

  // 2. Evaluate operations in the graph.
  for each operation in dataflowGraph {
    operation.costCPU = estimateCostCPU(operation);
    operation.costAccelerator = estimateCostAccelerator(operation);
    operation.dataDependency = calculateDataDependency(operation);
  }

  // 3. Partitioning Optimization
  // Use a cost function that considers CPU/Accelerator cost, data dependency, and power consumption
  // Apply a heuristic search (e.g., genetic algorithm, simulated annealing) to find the optimal partition
  partition = optimizePartition(partition, costFunction);

  // 4.  Generate Control Signals
  generateControlSignals(partition); // For interconnect & memory controller

  return partition;
}

function costFunction(partition) {
  cost = 0;
  // CPU/Accelerator cost
  cost += calculateExecutionCost(partition, CPU);
  cost += calculateExecutionCost(partition, Accelerator);
  // Data Dependency Cost
  cost += calculateDataTransferCost(partition);
  // Power Cost
  cost += calculatePowerConsumptionCost(partition);

  return cost;
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   **Reconfigurable Interconnect:** A mesh network or similar architecture allows dynamic routing.
*   **Fine-Grained Power Control:** Individual chiplets have dedicated power supplies and monitoring.
*   **Memory Access Arbitration:** Prioritize access based on partition.

**Novelty:** Existing systems typically have static partitioning. This design dynamically reshapes the dataflow graph *during* execution, adapting to changing workloads and maximizing efficiency. The runtime graph compiler and partitioning engine are key innovations.
