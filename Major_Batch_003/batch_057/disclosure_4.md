## Adaptive Beam Shaping via UE-Reported Reflective Surface Configuration

**Concept:** Extend the MIMO system to leverage ambient reflective surfaces (buildings, vehicles, even dedicated deployable reflectors) as dynamically configurable elements within the transmission environment. The UE reports optimal reflector configurations to the base station, which then adjusts beamforming weights *and* communicates configurations to actuators controlling the reflectors (if applicable). This isn’t about *creating* reflections, but *optimizing* existing ones.

**Specifications:**

**1. UE-Side Measurement & Reporting:**

*   **Reflector Mapping:** UE firmware includes algorithms to identify and map prominent reflective surfaces in its vicinity (using camera data, signal strength mapping, or dedicated sensors).
*   **Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) / Angle-of-Departure (AoD) Profiling:** UE estimates AoA/AoD profiles for signals reflecting off identified surfaces. This is *in addition* to direct path estimation.
*   **Reflectivity Estimation:** UE estimates the reflectivity of surfaces (rough approximation based on received signal power and surface material identification).
*   **Configuration Reporting:** UE reports to the base station:
    *   Reflector ID (unique identifier for each mapped surface).
    *   Estimated AoA/AoD profiles for each reflector.
    *   Estimated reflectivity for each reflector.
    *   Suggested reflector adjustment angles (if adjustable reflectors are detected – e.g., a smart window film).  This is a delta from a known default configuration.
    *   Quality metric – How much improvement this configuration is projected to yield.

**2. Base Station Processing:**

*   **Environment Map Construction:** The BS builds a dynamic map of the wireless environment, incorporating UE-reported reflector data.
*   **Hybrid Beamforming:** The BS performs beamforming calculations considering:
    *   Direct path.
    *   Reflected paths from each mapped reflector.
    *   UE-suggested reflector adjustment angles.
*   **Reflector Control (Optional):** If adjustable reflectors are present, the BS sends control signals to adjust reflector angles based on the calculated beamforming weights.  This could be a standardized protocol like DMX or a custom RF protocol.
*   **Precoding Matrix Calculation:**  The precoding matrix incorporates weights for both direct and reflected paths, optimized for each UE.

**3.  Hardware Requirements:**

*   **UE:**
    *   Camera (for surface identification).
    *   Signal strength mapping/direction finding capabilities (existing in many modern devices).
    *   Processing power to perform reflector mapping and angle estimation.
*   **Base Station:**
    *   Increased processing power to handle the more complex beamforming calculations.
    *   (Optional) RF transmitter to control adjustable reflectors.
    *   Storage for the dynamic environment map.

**4. Pseudocode (Base Station):**

```
// Initialize environment map
environment_map = {}

// For each UE report
for ue_report in ue_reports:
    // Update environment map with new/updated reflector data
    environment_map.update(ue_report.reflector_data)

    // Calculate optimal precoding matrix
    preceding_matrix = calculate_preceding_matrix(ue_report, environment_map)

    // If adjustable reflectors are present
    if adjustable_reflectors_present:
        // Send reflector adjustment commands
        send_reflector_commands(ue_report.reflector_commands)

    // Prepare multi-layered UE data and send to RU
    prepare_and_send_data(ue_report, preceding_matrix)

// Function to calculate preceding matrix
function calculate_preceding_matrix(ue_report, environment_map):
    // Include direct path and reflected paths in calculations
    // Optimize weights for each UE based on channel estimates and environment map
    // Return optimized precoding matrix
```

**5. Advantages:**

*   Improved signal strength and coverage.
*   Increased network capacity.
*   Reduced interference.
*   Dynamic adaptation to changing environments.
*   Potential for leveraging existing infrastructure (buildings, vehicles).
