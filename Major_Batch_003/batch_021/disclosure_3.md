**Adaptive Recommendation Weighting Based on Social Proximity & Behavioral Analysis**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the friend-assisted recommendation system by dynamically weighting recommendations based not only on the *relationship* between the participant and the recommending friend, but also on *predictive accuracy* of that friend's past recommendations *specifically within* the discovery service.

**II. Data Inputs:**

*   **Social Graph Data:** Existing social connections within the platform (friend, family, acquaintance - determined via user-defined tags and interaction frequency).
*   **Recommendation History:**  A log of all recommendations made by each user within the discovery service, along with the *outcome* of those recommendations (e.g., connection established, profile viewed, ignored).  This needs to be passively tracked and stored.
*   **Behavioral Data (Participant):** User activity *within* the discovery service – profile views, message exchanges, accepted connections, reported users, etc.
*   **Behavioral Data (Recommender):** Similar to above, tracking the recommender's behavior within the discovery service.
*   **Explicit Feedback:**  A mechanism for the participant to rate the helpfulness of a friend’s recommendations (e.g., thumbs up/down, “helpful/not helpful”).

**III. Algorithm:**

1.  **Relationship Score (RS):** Assign a base score based on the established social connection.  Example:
    *   Family: 1.0
    *   Close Friend: 0.8
    *   Acquaintance: 0.5
    *   Casual Connection: 0.2
2.  **Predictive Accuracy Score (PAS):** Calculated as:
    *   (Number of successful recommendations made by friend) / (Total number of recommendations made by friend).
    *   Successful recommendations: defined as a connection established *after* a recommendation, or a prolonged profile view (e.g. > 30 seconds)
3.  **Weighted Recommendation Score (WRS):**
    *   WRS = RS \* PAS \* (1 + Behavioral Similarity Score)
    *   **Behavioral Similarity Score:** A measure of how similar the participant’s and recommender's behavior is within the discovery service. For example, if both users tend to view profiles with similar characteristics (age, interests, location), the score is higher. (0 - 1)
4.  **Recommendation Ranking:**  Sort potential connections based on WRS. Higher scores mean more prioritized recommendations.

**IV. System Components:**

*   **Recommendation Engine:** Core logic for calculating WRS and ranking potential connections.
*   **Data Storage:**  Database to store social graph data, recommendation history, and behavioral data.
*   **API Endpoints:** Interfaces for accessing recommendation data and updating user preferences.
*   **User Interface:** Display prioritized recommendations to the participant, potentially highlighting the recommender and their relationship.

**V. Pseudocode (Recommendation Engine):**

```pseudocode
function getRecommendations(participantID, friendList):
  recommendations = []
  for friendID in friendList:
    RS = getRelationshipScore(participantID, friendID)
    PAS = getPredictiveAccuracyScore(friendID)
    BSS = getBehavioralSimilarityScore(participantID, friendID)
    WRS = RS * PAS * (1 + BSS)
    recommendations.append((friendID, WRS))

  recommendations.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True) // Sort by WRS descending
  return recommendations
```

**VI. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Decay Factor:**  Implement a decay factor for PAS, so older recommendations have less weight.
*   **Negative Feedback Penalty:** Reduce PAS when a friend's recommendation leads to a negative outcome (e.g., user reports the recommended connection).
*   **Contextual Weighting:** Adjust the weighting based on the specific *type* of discovery service (e.g., dating, professional networking).
*   **Dynamic Friend Selection:** The system actively suggests friends to ask for recommendations, based on their PAS and relationship to the participant.
