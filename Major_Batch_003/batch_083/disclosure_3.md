## Dynamic Content ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Risk Mitigation

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the sentiment analysis core of the provided patent, but extends it to create ‘shadow’ versions of digital content tailored to individual user risk profiles *before* content is presented.  It moves from *reacting* to sentiment to *proactively* mitigating risk.

**Core Concept:**

Instead of solely adjusting privacy settings *after* sentiment is detected, the system dynamically generates alternative versions of digital content – “shadows” – reflecting different levels of potential risk. These shadows are presented to the user based on a predictive model derived from their ongoing sentiment and historical data.

**Components:**

1.  **Content Shadow Generator:**  A module that creates multiple versions of a given digital content asset. These versions vary in granularity of data presented (e.g., blurring faces in images, redacting specific data points in text, simplifying complex visualizations) and the amount of personalization.  Higher risk profiles receive more heavily redacted/simplified content.

2.  **Predictive Risk Profile (PRP) Engine:**  This engine continuously analyzes user sentiment data (as defined in the patent), alongside browsing history, demographics, and declared preferences. It generates a PRP score representing the user’s current risk exposure.  The PRP score dynamically adjusts.

3.  **Content Selection & Delivery Manager:**  This component receives the PRP score, requests content from the Content Shadow Generator (specifying the desired level of redaction/simplification), and delivers the appropriate shadow version to the user.

**Pseudocode (Content Selection & Delivery Manager):**

```
FUNCTION deliverContent(userID, contentID):
    PRP = getPredictiveRiskProfile(userID)

    IF PRP > highRiskThreshold:
        shadowContent = requestShadowContent(contentID, redactionLevel="maximum")
    ELSE IF PRP > mediumRiskThreshold:
        shadowContent = requestShadowContent(contentID, redactionLevel="medium")
    ELSE:
        shadowContent = requestOriginalContent(contentID)

    deliverContentToUser(userID, shadowContent)
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION requestShadowContent(contentID, redactionLevel):
    // Access Content Shadow Generator.
    // Request contentID with specified redactionLevel.
    // Return shadowContent.
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  User interacts with digital content.
2.  Sentiment data is captured (patent's mechanism).
3.  PRP Engine calculates/updates the user’s PRP score.
4.  Content Selection Manager requests the appropriate content ‘shadow’ based on the PRP.
5.  Shadowed content is delivered to the user.
6.  User feedback on shadowed content informs ongoing PRP refinement.

**Novelty & Potential:**

This moves beyond reactive privacy adjustments to proactive risk mitigation, anticipating user sensitivities *before* content is displayed.  It allows for a more nuanced and tailored user experience, potentially increasing trust and engagement. It would also enable A/B testing of redaction levels to optimize user experience and privacy protection simultaneously.
