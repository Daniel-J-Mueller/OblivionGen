## Dynamic Social Graph Sharding with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the user bucketing approach to dynamically shard the social graph itself, not just the users, and proactively prefetch data based on predicted social interactions. This aims to reduce latency and improve responsiveness by anticipating data needs before requests are even made.

**Specs:**

1.  **Shard Generation & Assignment:**
    *   Social graph is recursively divided into shards, leveraging community detection algorithms (Louvain, Leiden) to identify strongly connected subgraphs.  Shards are not fixed; they evolve based on changes in social connections.
    *   Each shard is assigned a unique identifier (ShardID).
    *   Shard assignment is persistent and associated with user profiles. Each user is primarily associated with one shard, but may have secondary associations with adjacent shards (based on connection strength).

2.  **Shard-Aware Routing Table:**
    *   Routing tables are extended to include ShardID information. POP edge nodes maintain a mapping of ShardID to data center locations.
    *   Routing logic prioritizes directing traffic to the data center hosting the relevant shard(s).

3.  **Predictive Prefetching Engine:**
    *   Utilizes a machine learning model (e.g., Graph Neural Network) trained on historical social interaction data.
    *   Model predicts future interactions between users (e.g., likes, comments, shares, friend requests).
    *   Based on predictions, the system proactively prefetches data related to likely future interactions and stores it in a cache geographically close to the involved users.  Cache invalidation strategies are crucial to minimize stale data.
    *   Prefetching is throttled to avoid overloading the network or data centers.

4.  **Dynamic Shard Rebalancing:**
    *   Continuously monitors shard sizes and connection patterns.
    *   If a shard grows too large or becomes a bottleneck, it's automatically split into smaller shards.  This requires data migration, which should be done incrementally to minimize disruption.
    *   Algorithms for shard splitting prioritize minimizing edge cuts (bisecting connections) between shards.

5.  **User Session Management:**
    *   User sessions are “shard-aware”.  The initial request from a user determines their primary shard.
    *   Subsequent requests are routed directly to the data center hosting their primary shard.
    *   If a user frequently interacts with users in different shards, their session can be temporarily “extended” to include access to those shards.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Prefetching):**

```
// Training Phase (offline)
TrainGNN(HistoricalInteractionData) -> GNN_Model

// Real-time Prediction & Prefetching
function PrefetchData(UserA, UserB):
  InteractionProbability = GNN_Model.Predict(UserA, UserB)
  if InteractionProbability > Threshold:
    DataToPrefetch = GetRelevantData(UserA, UserB) // Likes, comments, posts
    CacheLocation = GetNearestCache(UserA, UserB)
    StoreDataInCache(CacheLocation, DataToPrefetch)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Shard`:  `ShardID`, `List<UserID>`, `AdjacencyList<ShardID>` (connections to other shards)
*   `User`: `UserID`, `PrimaryShardID`, `List<SecondaryShardID>`
*   `RoutingTable`: `ShardID` -> `DataCenterLocation`
*   `Cache`: `CacheLocation`, `Map<DataID, Data>`

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   Shard sizes must be carefully managed to ensure even load distribution across data centers.
*   The predictive prefetching engine must be able to handle a large volume of requests and maintain low latency.
*   Data replication and caching are crucial to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
