## Adaptive Congestion Prediction with Learned Queue Behavior

**Concept:** Expand the RDMA flow scheduling by incorporating a predictive element based on learned queue behavior within the network devices. This allows for proactive congestion avoidance rather than reactive scheduling.

**Specifications:**

**1. Queue Behavior Profiler (QBP):**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors queue occupancy, arrival rates, and service times for each queue pair (QP) within a defined network segment.
*   **Data Collection:**
    *   Timestamped queue length measurements.
    *   Inter-arrival times of RDMA requests.
    *   Service times for RDMA requests.
    *   RDMA message size.
*   **Learning Model:** Employs a recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, to learn the temporal dependencies in queue behavior.  The LSTM should be trained *per-queue* to capture individual characteristics.
*   **Output:** A probability distribution over future queue lengths, given the observed history. This represents the predicted congestion level.

**2. Predictive Scheduler:**

*   **Input:**  
    *   Predicted congestion level from the QBP for each QP.
    *   Current transmission rate of each QP.
    *   Service Level Agreement (SLA) parameters (target latency, throughput).
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Congestion Score Calculation:**  A congestion score is derived from the predicted congestion level. Higher predicted congestion translates to a higher score.
    2.  **Rate Adjustment:**
        *   If the congestion score exceeds a threshold, the transmission rate of the QP is reduced proportionally to the score.
        *   If the congestion score is below a threshold, the transmission rate can be increased (up to the maximum allowed by the SLA) to utilize available bandwidth.
    3.  **Prioritization:**  QPs with higher priority (based on SLA or application requirements) receive preference during rate adjustments.
    4.  **Integration with Existing Scheduler:**  The predictive scheduler works in conjunction with the existing RDMA flow scheduling and pacing scheme. It provides a congestion-aware adjustment factor to the base transmission rate.

**3. Network-Wide Synchronization:**

*   **Mechanism:** Implement a distributed synchronization protocol (e.g., gossip protocol) to share learned queue behavior profiles across network devices.
*   **Purpose:** Enable network devices to anticipate congestion hotspots and make proactive scheduling decisions.
*   **Data Shared:**  Compressed representations of the LSTM model parameters, along with relevant statistics (e.g., average queue length, variance).

**Pseudocode (Predictive Scheduler):**

```
function adjust_rate(qp, predicted_congestion, current_rate, sla_params):
  congestion_threshold = 0.7
  max_rate = sla_params.max_rate
  priority = qp.priority

  if predicted_congestion > congestion_threshold:
    reduction_factor = predicted_congestion - congestion_threshold
    new_rate = current_rate * (1 - reduction_factor)
    new_rate = max(new_rate, 0) # Ensure rate doesn't go negative
  else:
    increase_factor = 0.1  # Max 10% increase
    new_rate = current_rate * (1 + increase_factor)
    new_rate = min(new_rate, max_rate)  # Cap at max_rate

  # Prioritization adjustment: higher priority QPs get more leeway
  new_rate = new_rate * (1 + priority * 0.05)

  return new_rate
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   **Hardware:**  Network Interface Cards (NICs) with dedicated hardware acceleration for LSTM inference.
*   **Software:**  FPGA-based acceleration for LSTM implementation
*   **Software:** Machine learning framework compatible with NIC or FPGA, and optimized for low latency.
*   **Integration:** Drivers and APIs to seamlessly integrate with existing RDMA stacks and scheduling frameworks.
