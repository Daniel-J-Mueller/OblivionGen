## Dynamic Contextual Task Generation via Anticipatory Visual Processing

**Concept:** Extend the multimodal input analysis to *proactively* generate a menu of potential tasks *before* explicit user command, driven by anticipatory visual scene understanding. The system predicts likely user intents based on the visual input *and* ongoing dialogue, presenting a dynamic, visually-rich task menu.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Anticipatory Task Generator (ATG)
*   **Input:**
    *   Real-time video stream (client device camera).
    *   Audio stream (speech input).
    *   Dialogue state (history of interaction).
    *   Visual Analysis Result (subjects, attributes - as per patent).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Visual Scene Understanding:** Expand beyond subject/attribute detection. Implement scene graph generation (objects, relationships, actions). Utilize a pre-trained action recognition model.
    2.  **Intent Prediction:** Train a recurrent neural network (RNN) with attention mechanism. Input: combined features from visual scene graph, dialogue state, and audio (transcribed speech). Output: probability distribution over a pre-defined set of potential user tasks.  The RNN should be trained on a large dataset of user interactions with visual context.
    3.  **Task Menu Generation:** Based on the intent prediction, generate a dynamic task menu.  Visually represent each potential task with relevant icons, short descriptions, and confidence scores. Prioritize tasks with high confidence scores.
    4.  **Dynamic Refinement:** Continuously update the task menu based on user gaze, head pose (via camera), and ongoing speech.  If the user looks at a specific object in the scene, boost the confidence of related tasks.
*   **Output:** Dynamic, visually-rich task menu displayed on the client device.
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Increased processing power for real-time scene understanding and RNN inference.  High-resolution camera.
*   **Software Requirements:**
    *   Scene graph generation library.
    *   Pre-trained action recognition model.
    *   RNN implementation with attention mechanism.
    *   User interface framework for dynamic menu display.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generate_dynamic_menu(video_stream, audio_stream, dialogue_state):
  scene_graph = generate_scene_graph(video_stream)
  predicted_intents = predict_intents(scene_graph, audio_stream, dialogue_state)

  menu_items = []
  for intent, confidence in predicted_intents:
    menu_item = create_menu_item(intent, confidence)
    menu_items.append(menu_item)

  // Sort menu items by confidence (descending)
  menu_items.sort(key=lambda x: x.confidence, reverse=True)

  display_menu(menu_items)

  // Continuously update menu based on user gaze/head pose/speech
  while True:
    user_gaze = get_user_gaze()
    user_head_pose = get_user_head_pose()
    user_speech = get_user_speech()

    // Adjust confidence scores based on user attention
    for item in menu_items:
      if is_user_looking_at(user_gaze, item.related_object):
        item.confidence += 0.1
      else:
        item.confidence -= 0.01

    // Re-sort and re-display menu
    menu_items.sort(key=lambda x: x.confidence, reverse=True)
    display_menu(menu_items)
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond reactive task execution to proactive suggestion, increasing user efficiency and creating a more fluid, intuitive interaction experience.  The visual context *drives* the interaction, not just supports it. The continuous refinement based on user attention further personalizes the experience.
