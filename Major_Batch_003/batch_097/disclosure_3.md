## Adaptive Notification Prioritization & Contextual Bundling

**Core Concept:** Leverage user interaction patterns *beyond* the initial opt-in to dynamically prioritize and bundle follow-up messages, maximizing relevance and minimizing disruption.  This expands on the token-based system by integrating a ‘relevance score’ and adaptive bundling.

**Specifications:**

**1. Relevance Score Calculation:**

*   **Input Factors:**
    *   *Time Since Last Interaction*:  Recent interaction = higher score.
    *   *Interaction Type*:  Direct reply/action > passive view > simple open.
    *   *Content Category Affinity*:  Determine user’s preferred topics from past interactions.  (e.g., using topic modeling on message content).
    *   *Declared Preferences*: Allow explicit preference settings within the messaging platform.
*   **Score Formula:**  `Relevance Score = (0.5 * TimeSinceLastInteractionWeight) + (0.3 * InteractionTypeWeight) + (0.2 * ContentCategoryAffinityWeight)`. Weights are configurable server-side.
*   **Score Decay:**  Relevance score decreases over time, prompting periodic re-engagement or reducing follow-up frequency.

**2. Adaptive Bundling:**

*   **Bundling Threshold:** A configurable threshold determines when messages are bundled together.  Based on Relevance Score *and* Time-to-Delivery.
*   **Bundle Creation:** When multiple follow-up messages meet the bundling criteria, they are combined into a single, visually distinct notification.
*   **Bundle Presentation:**  
    *   *Summary Card*: Display a summary card in the notification with key information from each bundled message.
    *   *Expandable View*: Users can tap to expand the bundle and view individual messages.
    *   *Priority Indicators*:  Visually indicate the priority of each message within the bundle.

**3. System Architecture Additions:**

*   **Relevance Engine:** A dedicated service responsible for calculating Relevance Scores.  This can be implemented as a microservice and integrated with the messaging server.
*   **Bundling Service:**  A service responsible for managing bundle creation and presentation.  This service interacts with the Relevance Engine and the messaging server.
*   **API Extensions:**  Add new API endpoints for:
    *   *Setting User Preferences*:  Allow developers to integrate preference settings into their applications.
    *   *Requesting Relevance Score*: Allow developers to retrieve the current Relevance Score for a user.

**4. Pseudocode: Follow-Up Message Handling**

```
// Sender requests follow-up message
function handleFollowUpRequest(sender, clientDevice, messageContent) {
  token = generateToken(sender, clientDevice);

  //Get Relevance Score
  relevanceScore = RelevanceEngine.calculateScore(clientDevice);

  if (relevanceScore > bundlingThreshold) {
    //Add message to existing bundle (if one exists)
    BundleService.addMessageToBundle(clientDevice, messageContent, token);
    //Send bundle notification only when full or timeout reached
  } else {
    // Send individual follow-up message with token
    sendMessage(clientDevice, messageContent, token);
  }
}
```

**5. Token Update & Expiration:**

*   **Dynamic Expiration**: Token expiration is tied to Relevance Score. Higher score = longer expiration.
*   **Re-Authentication**: Periodic re-authentication prompts (via opt-in) to confirm continued user interest and reset token expiration.
*   **Token Revocation:**  Users can easily revoke follow-up message permissions at any time.
