## Dynamic Contact Prioritization via Predicted Engagement

**Concept:** Extend the contact list prioritization beyond simple content posting to *predict* which contacts will elicit a response or interaction from the user, shifting the focus from merely *showing* available content to proactively *facilitating* conversation.

**Specs:**

**1. Engagement Prediction Model:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Historical message exchange frequency & length (user to contact)
    *   Content interaction history (likes, comments, shares)
    *   Shared interests (derived from profile data, group memberships, etc.)
    *   Time-of-day/week activity patterns (both user & contact)
    *   Content type preference (image, video, text - both user & contact)
    *   Recency of last interaction
*   **Model Type:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. LSTM is suited for time-series data like interaction history.
*   **Output:**  A 'engagement score' (0-100) representing the predicted probability of a meaningful interaction within a defined timeframe (e.g., next hour, next day).

**2. Dynamic Contact List Reordering:**

*   **Hybrid Scoring:** Combine the existing score (based on content posting & initial claim 1) with the 'engagement score'.
    *   `Final Score = (Weight_Content * Content_Score) + (Weight_Engagement * Engagement_Score)`
    *   `Weight_Content` & `Weight_Engagement` are adjustable parameters (user-configurable via app settings). Default: 0.5 each.
*   **Contextual Boost:** If the user is currently *within* a message thread with a contact, that contact's position in the list is automatically elevated to the top, overriding all other scoring.
*   **"Quiet Contact" Detection:** Contacts who consistently receive low engagement scores for a prolonged period (e.g., > 30 days) are flagged. The user can choose to "snooze" or "remove" these contacts from the prioritized list.

**3.  "Engagement Nudge" Feature:**

*   **Proactive Suggestions:** Based on predicted engagement, the app proactively suggests potential conversation starters. (e.g., “It’s been a while – share this funny meme with [Contact Name]”)
*   **Automated Drafts:** Generate draft messages based on the predicted interaction. The user can review and send, or discard. (e.g., "Hey [Contact Name], saw this article and thought you'd find it interesting: [link]")
*   **A/B Testing:**  Experiment with different message templates and phrasing to optimize engagement rates.

**Pseudocode (Contact List Update):**

```
function updateContactList(user, contacts) {
  for (contact in contacts) {
    contact.contentScore = calculateContentScore(contact); // Existing Score
    contact.engagementScore = calculateEngagementScore(contact, user);
    contact.finalScore = (0.5 * contact.contentScore) + (0.5 * contact.engagementScore);

    // Check for current active thread
    if (user.activeThread == contact) {
      contact.finalScore = 999; // Boost to top
    }

    //Sort by finalScore descending
    sort(contacts, by finalScore);
  }
  return contacts;
}
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Engagement scores are stored per contact, updated periodically (e.g., hourly) via a background process.
*   User preferences (Weight_Content, Weight_Engagement, Snoozed Contacts) are stored in user profile data.
