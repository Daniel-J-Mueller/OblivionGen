## Dynamic Feature Interaction Graphs for Multi-Modal Data

**Concept:** Extend the feature-based technique by representing relationships between objects not as static embeddings, but as a dynamically constructed graph. This graph structure explicitly models the interactions between features *across multiple data modalities* (e.g., text, image, audio).  The graph's connectivity and edge weights are learned and adjusted during both training and inference, allowing for more nuanced and context-aware representations.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Preprocessing & Feature Extraction:**

*   **Multi-Modal Input:**  System accepts data from multiple modalities. (e.g., a product description (text), a product image, user review audio).
*   **Modality-Specific Encoders:**  Dedicated encoders (e.g., BERT for text, CNN for images, spectrogram analysis for audio) extract initial feature vectors for each modality.  Output: `F_text`, `F_image`, `F_audio` (where each F represents a vector of features).

**2. Dynamic Graph Construction:**

*   **Node Creation:**  Each initial feature vector (from each modality) becomes a node in the graph.
*   **Edge Weight Calculation:**  An “Interaction Module” calculates edge weights between nodes. This module is a trainable neural network.
    *   **Input:** Feature vectors from two nodes (e.g., `F_text[i]`, `F_image[j]`).
    *   **Process:** Concatenate the two feature vectors and pass them through multiple fully connected layers with ReLU activation.  The final layer outputs a scalar value representing the edge weight.  A sigmoid function constrains the weight between 0 and 1.
    *   **Output:** Edge weight `w_ij`
*   **Graph Assembly:** Build a graph where nodes are feature vectors and edge weights are determined by the Interaction Module.  Initial graph structure is sparse (only connections above a threshold are kept).  Threshold is a hyperparameter.

**3. Graph Neural Network (GNN) Processing:**

*   **Message Passing:**  Apply a GNN layer (e.g., Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) or Graph Attention Network (GAT)) to propagate information between nodes.
    *   **Node Update:** Each node’s feature vector is updated based on the weighted sum of its neighbors’ feature vectors.
    *   **Multiple Layers:**  Stack multiple GNN layers to allow for more complex information propagation.

**4. Prediction & Loss:**

*   **Readout Layer:**  Aggregate the final node embeddings to generate a prediction.  This could involve averaging the embeddings, using a pooling operation, or applying another neural network layer.
*   **Loss Function:**  Calculate a prediction loss based on the difference between the prediction and the ground truth. Backpropagate the loss to update all trainable parameters (encoders, Interaction Module, GNN layers, readout layer).

**5. Inference Stage Adaptations:**

*   **Dynamic Thresholding:** During inference, the edge weight threshold can be adjusted based on the confidence of the prediction. This allows for a more focused graph representation, reducing noise and improving accuracy.
*   **Pruning:** Remove edges with very low weights during inference to reduce computational cost.

**Pseudocode (Inference Stage):**

```python
def infer(input_text, input_image, input_audio):
    F_text = encode_text(input_text)
    F_image = encode_image(input_image)
    F_audio = encode_audio(input_audio)

    # Combine features (treat as nodes)
    nodes = [F_text, F_image, F_audio]

    # Calculate edge weights
    edges = []
    for i in range(len(nodes)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nodes)):
            weight = calculate_edge_weight(nodes[i], nodes[j])
            edges.append((i, j, weight))

    # Prune edges (optional)
    pruned_edges = [(u, v, w) for u, v, w in edges if w > threshold]

    # Build graph
    graph = build_graph(nodes, pruned_edges)

    # Run GNN
    updated_nodes = run_gnn(graph)

    # Readout and predict
    prediction = readout_and_predict(updated_nodes)

    return prediction
```

**Novelty:** The core innovation is the *dynamic* and *multi-modal* graph construction, allowing for richer feature interactions than static embeddings. It moves beyond simply combining embeddings to creating a network that explicitly models relationships between features from different sources. This should provide more contextually aware predictions.
