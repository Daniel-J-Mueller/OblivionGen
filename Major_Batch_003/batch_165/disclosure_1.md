## Dynamic Contextual UI ‘Bloom’

**Concept:** A UI element that ‘blooms’ or expands outward from a focal point on the screen, revealing related information and controls *only* as the user focuses their gaze or cursor. It's not a simple animation of existing elements, but the *creation* of new UI components procedurally.

**Specs:**

1.  **Gaze/Cursor Tracking:**  Real-time tracking of user’s gaze (eye-tracking hardware) *or* cursor position.  Accuracy must be sub-pixel for smooth activation.

2.  **Semantic Data Layer:** The system requires a ‘semantic map’ associated with the screen content. This map defines relationships between UI elements and data.  Example:  A photo of a cat is linked to tags: “cat”, “animal”, “pet”, “mammal”, “fur”, “domestic”.

3.  **Procedural UI Generation:** 
    *   A core set of ‘petal’ UI templates (buttons, sliders, text fields, image displays, etc.).  These are modular and customizable.
    *   A ‘bloom engine’ that selects appropriate petal templates based on the semantic data linked to the focal point.  Prioritization algorithm: most directly related tags first.
    *   Animation: Petals originate from the focal point, expanding outwards in a visually appealing manner (organic growth metaphor).  User-adjustable bloom speed and radius.
    *   Dynamic Sizing: Petal size and quantity are determined by the density of related semantic tags. Fewer tags = fewer, larger petals. Many tags = many smaller petals.

4.  **Interaction Model:**
    *   Petals are initially ‘ghosted’ or semi-transparent.
    *   Focusing gaze/cursor on a petal ‘solidifies’ it, making it interactable.
    *   Interaction triggers the petal’s function (e.g., adjusting a slider, opening a menu).
    *   Petals ‘wither’ and retract when focus is removed, returning the UI to its minimal state.

5.  **Customization:**
    *   User-definable ‘bloom styles’ (e.g., geometric, organic, minimalist).
    *   Adjustable petal color palettes.
    *   Control over bloom animation speed and intensity.

**Pseudocode (Bloom Engine):**

```
function generateBloom(focalPoint, semanticTags) {
  petalTemplates = [buttonTemplate, sliderTemplate, textFieldTemplate, imageDisplayTemplate];
  selectedPetals = [];
  
  for (tag in semanticTags) {
    relevantTemplate = findTemplateByTag(tag, petalTemplates);
    if (relevantTemplate) {
      newPetal = instantiateTemplate(relevantTemplate);
      newPetal.label = tag;
      newPetal.position = calculatePositionAroundFocalPoint(focalPoint, selectedPetals.length);
      selectedPetals.push(newPetal);
    }
  }
  
  return selectedPetals;
}

function calculatePositionAroundFocalPoint(focalPoint, index) {
  angle = (index / selectedPetals.length) * 360 degrees;
  radius = baseRadius + (index * petalSpacing);
  x = focalPoint.x + radius * cos(angle);
  y = focalPoint.y + radius * sin(angle);
  return (x, y);
}
```

**Potential Applications:**  Image editing, data visualization, gaming UI, augmented reality interfaces.  Allows for extremely dense information display without overwhelming the user, as elements are revealed contextually.
