## Dynamic Contextual GUI Shards

**Concept:** A GUI that isn't a unified screen, but a collection of independent, dynamically positioned “shards” of information. Each shard displays a specific data stream or function, and their arrangement is dictated by user focus *and* predictive AI based on usage patterns.

**Specs:**

*   **Shard Definition:** A "shard" is a rectangular (or potentially more complex polygonal) UI element capable of displaying any combination of text, images, graphs, video, and interactive controls. Size is variable (minimum 50x50 pixels, maximum screen width/height).

*   **Positioning Engine:**  A multi-layered system:
    *   **User Gaze/Touch Tracking:**  Primary shards (those directly interacted with) orbit the point of user focus. Proximity defines visual prominence (size, opacity, animation speed).
    *   **AI-Driven Prediction:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) analyzes user interaction history (application usage, data accessed, controls engaged) to predict the next likely action.  Shards related to predicted actions are proactively positioned within easy reach/view.  This is not just about *what* the user does, but *how* – speed of interaction, frequency, etc.
    *   **Data Dependency:**  Shards displaying real-time data streams (stock tickers, weather, sensor data) dynamically adjust position based on importance/urgency.  Critical alerts cause a shard to “pulse” and move to the center of focus.
    *   **Layering:** Shards can overlap, with the topmost shard taking input focus. A subtle "depth" effect (blur, shadow) visually indicates layering.

*   **Shard Types:**
    *   **Active:** User-interactable.  Can be dragged, resized, and customized.
    *   **Passive:** Display-only.  Used for status indicators, alerts, or background information.
    *   **Ephemeral:** Short-lived shards that appear for brief notifications or confirmations.
    *   **Contextual:** Shards dynamically generated based on the current application or data being viewed.

*   **Interaction Model:**
    *   **Drag & Drop:**  Users can reposition shards manually.
    *   **Resizing:** Users can resize shards to prioritize information.
    *   **Focus Lock:** User can "lock" a shard in place, preventing it from being moved by the AI.
    *   **Merge/Split:**  Users can merge multiple shards into a single larger shard, or split a shard into multiple smaller ones.
    *    **Gesture Control**: Incorporate gesture controls for shard manipulation. (e.g., pinch to resize, swipe to dismiss).

*   **Rendering Engine:**
    *   Hardware-accelerated 2D/3D rendering.
    *   Support for transparency, shadows, and other visual effects.
    *   Adaptive refresh rate to minimize power consumption.

**Pseudocode (AI Prediction Layer):**

```
function predict_next_shard_position(user_history, current_application, data_streams):
  # user_history: list of user actions (timestamp, application, data accessed, controls engaged)
  # current_application: name of the current application
  # data_streams: list of active data streams

  # Load pre-trained RNN model
  model = load_rnn_model("rnn_model.h5")

  # Prepare input features
  features = prepare_features(user_history, current_application, data_streams)

  # Predict next action probability distribution
  probabilities = model.predict(features)

  # Identify top N most likely actions
  top_actions = get_top_n(probabilities, 5)

  # Map actions to relevant shard IDs
  shard_ids = map_actions_to_shards(top_actions)

  # Calculate ideal positions based on user gaze and screen space
  positions = calculate_positions(shard_ids, user_gaze, screen_width, screen_height)

  return positions
```
