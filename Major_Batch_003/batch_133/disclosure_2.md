## Dynamic Slot Type Morphing with Contextual Embeddings

**Concept:** Expand upon claim 9 and 10 by introducing a system where slot types aren't fixed but *morph* dynamically based on a combination of the intent, contextual embeddings from surrounding n-grams, and a learned knowledge graph representing relationships between slot types. This aims to resolve ambiguity and improve understanding in complex user requests.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Slot Type Embedding Layer:**
    *   Each known slot type will have a trainable embedding vector.
    *   An additional "unknown" slot type embedding will be present.
    *   Initial slot type assignment based on a traditional method (rule-based, ML classification, etc.).

2.  **Contextual Embedding Module:**
    *   Utilize a pre-trained language model (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.).
    *   Input: A window of n-grams surrounding the current slot. (Configurable window size).
    *   Output: A contextual embedding vector representing the semantic meaning of the surrounding text.

3.  **Knowledge Graph:**
    *   Construct a graph where nodes represent slot types and edges represent relationships (e.g., "is-a," "related-to," "can-be").
    *   Edges can have weights representing the strength of the relationship (learned from data).

4.  **Morphing Function:**
    *   Input: Initial slot type embedding, Contextual Embedding, Knowledge Graph.
    *   Process:
        *   Calculate similarity between Contextual Embedding and embeddings of adjacent slot types in the Knowledge Graph.
        *   Weighted sum of initial slot type embedding and neighboring slot type embeddings. Weights are derived from similarity scores and edge weights in the Knowledge Graph.
        *   Apply a sigmoid function to normalize the output.
    *   Output: Morphing vector.

5.  **Adaptive Resolution:**
    *   During intent resolution, the morphing vector is added to the initial slot type embedding.
    *   This adjusted embedding is used for entity lookup and intent classification.
    *   If the adjusted embedding points to a different entity type, the system attempts to resolve the request using the new type.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function morph_slot_type(initial_slot_embedding, contextual_embedding, knowledge_graph):
  neighboring_slots = find_neighbors(initial_slot_embedding, knowledge_graph)

  similarity_scores = []
  for slot in neighboring_slots:
    similarity_scores.append(calculate_similarity(contextual_embedding, slot.embedding))

  weighted_sum = initial_slot_embedding

  for i, slot in enumerate(neighboring_slots):
    weight = similarity_scores[i] * slot.edge_weight
    weighted_sum = weighted_sum + (weight * slot.embedding)

  morphed_embedding = sigmoid(weighted_embedding)
  return morphed_embedding

function resolve_request(user_input):
  slots = extract_slots(user_input)
  for slot in slots:
    morphed_embedding = morph_slot_type(slot.initial_embedding, get_contextual_embedding(slot.ngram), knowledge_graph)
    slot.embedding = morphed_embedding
    resolved_entity = lookup_entity(slot.embedding)
    if resolved_entity:
        slot.entity = resolved_entity
  intent = classify_intent(user_input, slots)
  generate_response(intent, slots)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires significant computational resources for training and inference with large language models.
*   Knowledge Graph should be scalable and efficiently queryable.
*   GPU acceleration recommended for language model processing.
*   Python with libraries like TensorFlow/PyTorch, SpaCy, and a graph database (Neo4j) are suitable for implementation.
