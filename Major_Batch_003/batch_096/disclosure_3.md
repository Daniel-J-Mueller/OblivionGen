## Dynamic Content ‘Provenance’ Display & Interactive Rights Negotiation

**Concept:** Expand the content analytics interface to visualize not just *unauthorized uses* and revenue, but the complete ‘provenance’ of content rights – a dynamic, layered display showing *all* stakeholders with rights, their specific rights (e.g., geographic, duration, usage type), and an interface for direct, automated rights negotiation.

**Specs:**

**1. Provenance Layer:**

*   **Data Source:** Augment existing content ownership information with a ‘Rights Registry’ database (internal or potentially blockchain-based).  This registry stores detailed rights information for *all* parties with a stake in the content – original creator, publishers, distributors, translators, remixers, etc.
*   **Visualization:** Within the analytics interface, add a ‘Provenance’ tab. This displays the content item at the center, surrounded by concentric layers representing rights holders.
    *   **Layer 1 (Innermost):** Original Creator – Displays creator details, percentage of ownership, and total revenue earned.
    *   **Layer 2:** Primary Publisher/Distributor – Displays publisher details, rights granted (e.g., North American distribution, 5-year license), revenue share, and reporting frequency.
    *   **Layer 3+:** Subsequent Rights Holders – Displays details for each subsequent party (e.g., translator for Spanish market, remixer for specific track, regional distributor). Layers dynamically expand/contract based on the complexity of rights.
*   **Interactive Elements:**  Clicking on a rights holder layer reveals detailed information:
    *   Specific rights granted/restricted.
    *   Duration of rights.
    *   Geographic scope.
    *   Revenue share/payment schedule.
    *   Contact information.

**2. Automated Rights Negotiation Interface:**

*   **Trigger:** Activated when a potential unauthorized use is detected *or* a user wants to expand usage rights.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Conflict Detection:** System identifies the rights holder(s) whose rights are potentially infringed upon or needed for expanded use.
    2.  **Negotiation Initiation:** System initiates a negotiation process with the relevant rights holder(s) via automated messaging.
    3.  **Proposal Generation:** System generates a range of proposals for rights acquisition. Proposals can include:
        *   **One-time license fee.**
        *   **Revenue share (percentage of ad revenue, clicks, or views).**
        *   **Time-limited license.**
        *   **Geographic restriction.**
    4.  **AI-Powered Negotiation:** AI engine analyzes rights holder’s historical negotiation data (if available) and proposes an optimal offer. 
    5.  **Automated Agreement:** If the rights holder accepts the offer, a smart contract is automatically executed, updating rights ownership and payment schedules.
    6.  **Escalation:** If negotiation fails, the system escalates the issue to a human mediator.

**3. Pseudocode (Negotiation Module):**

```
FUNCTION initiate_negotiation(content_item, desired_usage)
  rights_holders = GET_RIGHTS_HOLDERS(content_item)
  impacted_holders = FILTER(rights_holders, FUNCTION(holder) IS_IMPACTED_BY(holder, desired_usage))

  FOR EACH holder IN impacted_holders
    proposal = GENERATE_PROPOSAL(holder, desired_usage) // AI-powered
    SEND_PROPOSAL(holder, proposal)
    response = WAIT_FOR_RESPONSE(holder)

    IF response == ACCEPT
      EXECUTE_SMART_CONTRACT(proposal)
      UPDATE_RIGHTS_OWNERSHIP(content_item, proposal)
    ELSE IF response == REJECT
      propose_counteroffer(holder)
    ELSE
      escalate_to_human_mediator(holder)
  END FOR
END FUNCTION
```

**4. Data Requirements:**

*   Detailed rights registry (internal or blockchain) with comprehensive information on rights ownership, usage restrictions, and revenue sharing.
*   Historical negotiation data for each rights holder (optional but highly valuable for AI training).
*   Real-time data on content usage (views, clicks, location) to accurately assess impact on rights holders.
