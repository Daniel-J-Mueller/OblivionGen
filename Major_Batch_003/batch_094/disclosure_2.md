## Temporal Histogram Variance for Predictive Frame Skipping

**Concept:** Leverage the variance of smoothed histograms *over time* to dynamically determine optimal frame skipping rates during video encoding. This aims to intelligently reduce encoding complexity without sacrificing perceived visual quality, going beyond simply comparing histograms of individual frames.

**Specs:**

**1. Histogram Collection & Smoothing:**
   *   Collect reference and current frame histograms as described in the provided patent (YUV plane, 256+ bins, Gaussian smoothing).
   *   Store a rolling window of *n* smoothed reference histograms (e.g., n=5-10).  This creates a temporal histogram sequence.

**2. Variance Calculation:**
   *   For each histogram bin, calculate the variance across the rolling window of smoothed reference histograms. This yields a ‘histogram variance map’ – a map representing how much each color/luminance value is changing over short periods.
   *   Calculate a global variance metric by averaging the variances across all histogram bins.

**3. Predictive Frame Skipping:**
   *   Establish a baseline frame skipping rate.
   *   **Dynamic Adjustment:**
        *   If the global histogram variance is *below* a threshold (indicating little change in the scene), *increase* the frame skipping rate.
        *   If the global histogram variance is *above* a threshold (indicating significant motion or scene change), *decrease* the frame skipping rate (potentially even encoding every frame).
   *   Implement a smoothing filter (e.g., exponential moving average) on the adjusted frame skipping rate to avoid abrupt changes.

**4. Weighted Prediction Integration:**
   *   The weighted prediction scheme from the provided patent is still applied, but its influence is *modulated* by the frame skipping rate.  Higher frame skip rates slightly *reduce* the weight given to predicted blocks, encouraging more intra-frame coding (as the skipped frames provide less reliable prediction data).

**5. Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Initialization
rolling_histogram_window = [ ];
baseline_frame_skip_rate = 2;  // Skip every other frame
variance_threshold_low = 0.1;
variance_threshold_high = 1.0;
smoothing_factor = 0.7;

// Per-frame processing
function process_frame(current_frame) {

  current_histogram = calculate_histogram(current_frame);
  smoothed_current_histogram = apply_smoothing(current_histogram);

  // Calculate variance
  if (rolling_histogram_window.length < rolling_window_size) {
    rolling_histogram_window.append(smoothed_current_histogram);
  } else {
    rolling_histogram_window.pop_front();
    rolling_histogram_window.append(smoothed_current_histogram);
  }

  histogram_variance_map = calculate_histogram_variance(rolling_histogram_window);
  global_variance = average(histogram_variance_map);

  // Adjust frame skip rate
  if (global_variance < variance_threshold_low) {
    frame_skip_rate = frame_skip_rate + 1;
  } else if (global_variance > variance_threshold_high) {
    frame_skip_rate = max(1, frame_skip_rate - 1);
  }

  // Smooth frame skip rate
  frame_skip_rate = smoothing_factor * frame_skip_rate + (1 - smoothing_factor) * previous_frame_skip_rate;

  // Apply weighted prediction (modulated by frame skip rate)
  weighted_prediction_strength = 1.0 - (frame_skip_rate / 10.0); // Example modulation
  apply_weighted_prediction(current_frame, weighted_prediction_strength);

  // Encode frame (or skip it)
  if (frame_skip_rate > 0) {
    skip_frame();
  } else {
    encode_frame(current_frame);
  }

}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Adaptive encoding complexity based on content dynamics.
*   Improved compression ratio with minimal perceptual loss.
*   Robustness to various video scenes (static, slow motion, fast action).
*   Potentially synergistic with other advanced encoding techniques.
