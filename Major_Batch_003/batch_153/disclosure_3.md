## Dynamic Pseudo-Node Weighting based on Real-time Network Conditions

**Concept:** Enhance the pseudo-node topology by dynamically adjusting weights assigned to each pseudo-node based on real-time network conditions (latency, bandwidth, packet loss) *between* the user and the physical nodes comprising that pseudo-node. This moves beyond static pseudo-node creation and incorporates current network performance for more adaptive routing.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Network Condition Monitor (NCM)
    *   Function: Continuously monitors network conditions (latency, bandwidth, packet loss) between the user device and each physical node (PoPs, ECCs) that contribute to pseudo-nodes. Utilizes active probing (ICMP pings, TCP SYN probes) and passive monitoring (analyzing network traffic statistics).
    *   Output: Real-time performance metrics for each physical node.
*   **Component:** Pseudo-Node Weight Calculator (PNWC)
    *   Input: Real-time performance metrics from NCM. Pseudo-node definition (which PoPs and ECCs comprise each pseudo-node).
    *   Algorithm:
        1.  For each pseudo-node:
            a.  Calculate a weight score for each constituent physical node based on its current performance metrics.  A weighted sum of latency, inverse bandwidth, and packet loss percentage. (e.g. `Weight = (0.5 * Latency) + (0.3 * (1/Bandwidth)) + (0.2 * PacketLoss)`)
            b.  Normalize the weight scores for all nodes *within* that pseudo-node to sum to 1.
            c.  The normalized weight becomes the dynamic weight for that physical node *within* the pseudo-node.
        2.  Output: A dynamically weighted pseudo-node topology.  Each pseudo-node now includes a list of constituent physical nodes and their corresponding dynamic weights.
*   **Component:** Adaptive Routing Engine (ARE)
    *   Input: Dynamically weighted pseudo-node topology. User request.
    *   Algorithm:
        1.  Select the "best" pseudo-node based on overall weight scores (sum of constituent node weights).
        2.  *Within* the selected pseudo-node, probabilistically select a physical node based on its dynamic weight. Higher weight = higher probability of selection.  A random number generator can be used to make this probabilistic determination.
        3.  Route the user request to the selected physical node.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `PseudoNode`: {`ID`: Integer, `ConstituentNodes`: List[(`NodeID`: Integer, `Weight`: Float)]}
    *   `NetworkMetrics`: {`NodeID`: Integer, `Latency`: Float, `Bandwidth`: Float, `PacketLoss`: Float}
*   **Pseudocode (ARE):**

```
function RouteRequest(request, pseudoNodeTopology):
  bestPseudoNode = SelectBestPseudoNode(pseudoNodeTopology)
  selectedNode = ProbabilisticNodeSelection(bestPseudoNode.ConstituentNodes)
  Route request to selectedNode.NodeID
end function

function SelectBestPseudoNode(pseudoNodeTopology):
  bestNode = null
  bestScore = -1
  for each node in pseudoNodeTopology:
    score = 0
    for each constituentNode in node.ConstituentNodes:
      score += constituentNode.Weight
    if score > bestScore:
      bestScore = score
      bestNode = node
  return bestNode
end function

function ProbabilisticNodeSelection(ConstituentNodes):
  totalWeight = sum of all weights in ConstituentNodes
  randomNumber = random number between 0 and totalWeight
  cumulativeWeight = 0
  for each node in ConstituentNodes:
    cumulativeWeight += node.Weight
    if cumulativeWeight >= randomNumber:
      return node
  return last node (should rarely happen due to floating point precision)
end function
```

**Refinement:**  The weighting algorithm could be further refined to account for application-specific requirements (e.g., prioritize low latency for interactive applications, prioritize bandwidth for streaming). This allows for Quality of Service (QoS) differentiation.
