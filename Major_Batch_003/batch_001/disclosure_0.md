## Dynamic Contextual Item Bundling & Proactive Suggestion

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple similarity-based item arrangement to proactively suggest *bundles* of items based on predicted user needs *before* they interact with a link. Leverage multi-modal input (image, text, user history) to anticipate intent and create compelling, pre-arranged bundles displayed *within* the content item itself.

**Specs:**

**1. Multi-Modal Intent Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Content Item Image: Visual analysis for dominant objects, scenes, styles.
    *   Content Item Text: NLP analysis of captions, tags, surrounding text.
    *   User History: Browsing history, purchase history, saved items, demographic data.
    *   Entity Item Catalog: Comprehensive data on all items associated with the entity.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Employ a transformer-based neural network (e.g., a variant of CLIP or BLIP) trained to map content item features to a latent space representing user intent.
    *   User history is embedded and used to bias the intent prediction towards personalized recommendations.
    *   The model outputs a probability distribution over potential user intents (e.g., "completing a living room," "planning a hiking trip," "finding a gift for a friend").
*   **Output:**  A ranked list of predicted user intents with associated confidence scores.

**2. Bundle Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Predicted user intents (from Step 1), Entity Item Catalog.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Utilize a knowledge graph representing relationships between items (e.g., “sofa” -> “coffee table,” “area rug”).
    *   Employ a constraint satisfaction algorithm to identify item combinations that align with the predicted user intent and knowledge graph relationships.
    *   Apply a “bundle cohesion score” that measures how well the items complement each other (based on style, color, function, price).
*   **Output:**  A set of pre-defined item bundles, ranked by cohesion score.

**3. Dynamic Content Item Integration:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Upon content item upload/creation, trigger the Multi-Modal Intent Prediction Engine and Bundle Generation Module.
    *   Dynamically generate a visual carousel or grid of suggested item bundles *within* the content item display.
    *   Each bundle displays a consolidated price and a “Add to Cart” button for immediate purchase.
    *   Employ A/B testing to optimize bundle presentation and layout.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generate_proactive_bundles(content_item):
  intent_predictions = predict_intent(content_item)
  best_intent = max(intent_predictions, key=intent_predictions.get)

  bundles = generate_bundles_for_intent(best_intent)

  #Sort bundles by price, cohesion score, and user history
  sorted_bundles = sort_bundles(bundles)

  return sorted_bundles

function sort_bundles(bundles):
  # Combine multiple scoring metrics
  scores = []
  for bundle in bundles:
    price_score = 1 / bundle.total_price #Lower price is better
    cohesion_score = bundle.cohesion_score
    history_score = calculate_user_history_score(bundle)
    total_score = price_score + cohesion_score + history_score
    scores.append((bundle, total_score))

  sorted_bundles = sorted(scores, key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)
  return [bundle for bundle, score in sorted_bundles]
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple item arrangement *after* interaction to anticipate user needs and proactively display curated bundles within the content itself.  It combines multi-modal analysis, knowledge graphs, and user history to create a more engaging and efficient shopping experience. It is about *anticipation* before user interaction.
