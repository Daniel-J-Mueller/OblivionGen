## Adaptive Content "Warm-Up" & Predictive Engagement Scoring

**Concept:** The patent focuses on adjusting bids for content based on infrequent actions. This inspires a system that proactively “warms up” content *before* it's presented, and a more nuanced engagement score beyond simple click/conversion metrics.

**Specs:**

**1. Content Warm-Up Module:**

*   **Purpose:**  To pre-seed engagement signals for new or rarely displayed content.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Synthetic Exposure:**  A small percentage of users (e.g., 0.1% – adjustable) receive the content without typical targeting criteria. This is purely to gather initial impression data.
    *   **Engagement "Boost":**  For synthetic exposures, the initial engagement (impression, hover, brief scroll) is artificially weighted *higher* in the model.  (Weighting factor adjustable, e.g., x2, x5).  This doesn’t change the displayed content, it just alters the internal model learning.
    *   **Decay:** The "boost" effect decays rapidly (e.g., linearly over 24-48 hours), returning to normal model learning.
    *   **Thresholding:** Only activate warm-up for content with fewer than ‘N’ impressions (adjustable threshold).

**2. Predictive Engagement Scoring (PES):**

*   **Beyond Clicks:** PES moves beyond binary click/no-click.  It calculates a continuous score (0-100) representing the *likelihood of sustained engagement* (e.g., time spent, scrolling depth, interaction with embedded elements).
*   **Feature Set:** PES utilizes a multi-layered feature set:
    *   **Content Features:**  Semantic analysis of content (topics, sentiment, complexity), visual features (image quality, color palette, video length).
    *   **User Features:**  Long-term engagement history, browsing patterns, declared interests, demographic data.
    *   **Contextual Features:** Time of day, device type, user location, referring source.
    *   **Micro-Interaction Features:** Mouse movements (dwell time, scrolling speed), touch events (swipe direction, pinch zoom).
*   **Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) with attention mechanisms to weight the importance of different features over time.
*   **Scoring:** The RNN outputs a probability distribution representing the likelihood of different engagement durations. The expected value of this distribution is the PES score.
*   **Integration with Bidding:** PES is integrated with the bidding system. The bid amount is adjusted proportionally to the PES score.  Higher PES = Higher bid.

**3.  Dynamic Thresholding for Bid Adjustment**

*   **Rate of Change Analysis:**  Calculate the rate of change of the PES score *over time*. (e.g. change in PES over the last hour, day, week).
*   **Thresholds:**  Define dynamic thresholds for the rate of change.
    *   **Positive Rate of Change:** If the PES score is increasing rapidly, increase the bid amount aggressively.
    *   **Negative Rate of Change:** If the PES score is decreasing rapidly, decrease the bid amount aggressively.
    *   **Stable PES:** If the PES score is stable, maintain the current bid amount.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  Continuously learn and adjust the dynamic thresholds based on real-time performance.



**Pseudocode (Dynamic Thresholding):**

```
function adjustBid(contentItem, currentBid) {
  pesScore = calculatePES(contentItem);
  rateOfChange = calculateRateOfChange(pesScore);

  if (rateOfChange > positiveThreshold) {
    newBid = currentBid * (1 + aggressiveIncreaseFactor);
  } else if (rateOfChange < negativeThreshold) {
    newBid = currentBid * (1 - aggressiveDecreaseFactor);
  } else {
    newBid = currentBid;
  }

  return newBid;
}
```
