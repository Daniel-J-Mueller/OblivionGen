## Dynamic Mood-Based Stream Overlay System

**Concept:** Leverage real-time viewer emotional analysis (via webcam/device mic) to dynamically alter the broadcaster’s stream overlay – not just visually, but *functionally*. This moves beyond simple reaction clips to actively shape the broadcast experience based on collective emotional state.

**Specs:**

**1. Emotional Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time video/audio feed from viewer devices (opt-in, privacy-focused – data processed locally on device whenever possible).
*   **Processing:** AI-powered emotion detection (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, neutral).  Local processing preferred, with aggregated, anonymized data sent to a central server for overall stream "mood" assessment.
*   **Output:**  "Mood Score" – a vector representing the prevalence of different emotions across the viewing audience. Mood Score updated every 0.5-1 second.  A secondary output is per-user emotion data, stored *temporarily* for triggering individual effects (see section 3).

**2. Stream Overlay Control System:**

*   **Input:** Mood Score from the Emotional Analysis Module.  Broadcaster-configurable mapping rules.
*   **Mapping Rules:**  The broadcaster defines how each emotional state (or combination of states) impacts the stream overlay. Examples:
    *   *High Joy:* Overlay becomes brighter, more animated. Confetti effect triggered.  Music volume increased slightly.
    *   *High Anger:* Overlay shifts to darker, more aggressive colors.  Sound effects become harsher.  Potential for a temporary "calming" visual element (e.g., a slow-moving animation).
    *   *High Sadness:* Overlay becomes desaturated.  A subtle, atmospheric visual effect is triggered (e.g., rain animation).  Music volume lowered.
    *   *High Fear:*  Overlay flashes briefly.  Sound effect (e.g., a heartbeat) is added.
    *   *Neutral:* Overlay returns to its default state.
*   **Output:** Control signals to the stream overlay engine (see section 4).

**3.  Personalized Reaction “Echo” System:**

*   **Input:** Per-user emotional data (from the Emotional Analysis Module) *and* live video feed from the viewer.
*   **Trigger:** If a viewer displays a strong, sustained emotion (e.g., extreme joy), a short clip of their reaction is captured (with explicit consent).
*   **Echo Effect:** The captured reaction clip is displayed as a *subtle* overlay on the broadcaster’s stream – not as a full-screen reaction clip, but as a small, ephemeral “echo” effect around the broadcaster’s avatar or within the stream environment. The size and duration of the echo are proportional to the intensity of the viewer’s emotion.
*   **Privacy:** Viewers must opt-in to have their reactions captured and displayed.  A clear visual indicator shows when a viewer’s reaction is being used.

**4. Stream Overlay Engine:**

*   **Input:** Control signals from the Stream Overlay Control System *and* personalized echo signals (if applicable).
*   **Functionality:** Dynamically adjusts the stream overlay (colors, animations, visual effects, music volume) based on the received control signals.  Handles the display of personalized echo effects.
*   **Integration:**  Integrates with existing streaming platforms (Twitch, YouTube, etc.) via a plugin or API.



**Pseudocode (Stream Overlay Control System):**

```
function processMoodScore(moodScore):
  joyLevel = moodScore.joy
  angerLevel = moodScore.anger
  sadnessLevel = moodScore.sadness
  fearLevel = moodScore.fear

  if joyLevel > 0.7:
    setOverlayBrightness(1.2)
    playAnimation("confetti")
    adjustMusicVolume(1.1)
  elif angerLevel > 0.7:
    setOverlayColor("red")
    playAnimation("aggressive_pattern")
    adjustMusicVolume(0.9)
  elif sadnessLevel > 0.7:
    setOverlayColor("blue")
    playAnimation("rain")
    adjustMusicVolume(0.8)
  elif fearLevel > 0.7:
    setOverlayColor("dark_red")
    flashOverlay(0.2)
    playAudio("heartbeat")
  else:
    resetOverlay()

function setOverlayBrightness(level):
  // Code to adjust stream overlay brightness

function playAnimation(name):
  // Code to trigger stream overlay animation

function adjustMusicVolume(level):
  // Code to adjust music volume

function setOverlayColor(color):
  // Code to adjust stream overlay color

function flashOverlay(duration):
  // Code to flash stream overlay

function resetOverlay():
  // Code to reset stream overlay to default state
