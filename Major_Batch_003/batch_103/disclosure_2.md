## Adaptive Burst Prediction & Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the DMA system with a predictive burst size adjustment and prefetching capability based on observed tensor access patterns. The goal is to reduce latency and maximize throughput by anticipating data needs *before* the controllers issue requests.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Component:** *Burst Prediction Engine (BPE)* – A small, dedicated hardware unit integrated alongside the DMA agent. It features a history buffer and a lightweight machine learning model.
*   **History Buffer:** Stores recent burst sizes and corresponding memory access patterns (sequences of addresses) for both source and destination tensors. Size: 256KB SRAM.  Associative memory organization for fast pattern matching.
*   **ML Model:** A shallow neural network (e.g., a 2-layer perceptron) trained on the historical data. Input: Sequence of recent address differences (delta encoding). Output: Predicted burst size for the next access.  Model weights are updated periodically (e.g., every 1000 bursts) using a stochastic gradient descent variant.
*   **Prefetch Buffer:** 64KB SRAM located between the source memory and DMA agent.  Used to hold prefetched data.
*   **DMA Agent Modification:** The agent now receives a “confidence score” from the BPE along with the predicted burst size. If the confidence score is above a threshold (adjustable parameter), the agent uses the predicted burst size. Otherwise, it defaults to the size specified by the controllers.
*   **Prefetch Initiation:** When a burst request is initiated, the BPE attempts to predict the *next* required data based on the access pattern. If a prediction is made, the DMA agent initiates a prefetch request to the source memory, writing the data into the prefetch buffer.
*   **Cache Coherence:** Implement a simple cache coherence mechanism to ensure that the prefetch buffer doesn’t hold stale data. A tag associated with each block in the prefetch buffer stores the last modified timestamp.

**Pseudocode (DMA Agent):**

```
function issue_read_request(source_address, burst_size):
  predicted_burst_size, confidence = BPE.predict_burst_size(source_address)
  if confidence > threshold:
    actual_burst_size = predicted_burst_size
  else:
    actual_burst_size = burst_size

  read_request = create_read_request(source_address, actual_burst_size)
  send(read_request)
  data = receive_data(read_request)
  store(data, alignment_buffer)

function issue_write_request(destination_address, burst_size):
  predicted_burst_size, confidence = BPE.predict_burst_size(destination_address)
  if confidence > threshold:
    actual_burst_size = predicted_burst_size
  else:
    actual_burst_size = burst_size

  write_request = create_write_request(destination_address, actual_burst_size)
  send(write_request)
  data = retrieve_data(alignment_buffer)
  send(data)
```
