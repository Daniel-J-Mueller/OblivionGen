**Personalized Activity Generation via Generative AI**

**Concept:** Expand beyond pre-defined activities by leveraging a generative AI model to create *dynamic* activities tailored to the specific users involved in the video exchange. The system would analyze user profiles, past interactions, and real-time context to generate unique activity suggestions.

**Specs:**

1.  **User Profile Data:**
    *   Gather data from user profiles including: interests, hobbies, relationship to other users, activity history within the system, publicly available social media data (with consent).
    *   Create a vector embedding representing each user’s preferences.

2.  **Generative Activity Model:**
    *   Train a large language model (LLM) – potentially a diffusion model fine-tuned for activity generation – on a dataset of successful video exchange activities (descriptions, themes, associated visual elements).
    *   The model takes as input:
        *   Vector embeddings of the requesting user and the intended recipients.
        *   Contextual data (time of day, day of week, recent events relevant to users).
        *   A “creativity” parameter controlling the novelty of the generated activities.
    *   The model outputs:
        *   Activity Name (string)
        *   Activity Description (string)
        *   Thematic Content Suggestions (list of strings – background images, visual effects, music tracks, suggested prompts/questions to initiate conversation).

3.  **Activity Scoring & Ranking:**
    *   A separate scoring model evaluates generated activities based on:
        *   Relevance to user profiles (similarity of user embeddings to activity embeddings).
        *   Novelty (to avoid suggesting the same activities repeatedly).
        *   “Social Cohesion” – a metric estimating how likely the activity is to be enjoyed by *all* participants (based on shared interests and relationship dynamics).
    *   Activities are ranked based on this score.

4.  **Real-time Activity Adaptation:**
    *   During the video exchange, the system could monitor user engagement (e.g., facial expressions, voice tone, conversation topics).
    *   Based on this feedback, the generative model could subtly adapt the activity (e.g., suggest alternative visual effects, modify conversation prompts).

5.  **User Feedback Loop:**
    *   Users can rate generated activities and provide free-text feedback.
    *   This data is used to fine-tune both the generative model and the activity scoring model.

**Pseudocode (Activity Generation):**

```python
def generate_activity(requesting_user, recipients, context, creativity):
  user_embeddings = [get_user_embedding(user) for user in [requesting_user] + recipients]
  activity_prompt = create_prompt(user_embeddings, context, creativity) #Combines embeddings and context
  generated_activity = generative_model.generate(activity_prompt) # LLM generates activity details
  scored_activity = scoring_model.score(generated_activity, user_embeddings)
  return scored_activity
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Integration with external APIs (e.g., image generation, music streaming).
*   Allow users to collaboratively edit generated activity descriptions.
*   Implement a “serendipity” parameter to intentionally suggest unexpected activities.
