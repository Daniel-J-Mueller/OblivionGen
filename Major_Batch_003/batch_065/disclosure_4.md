**Dynamic Mesh Adaptation via Predictive Node Role Switching**

**Concept:** Extend the existing mesh network optimization by introducing a predictive system that anticipates potential link failures or congestion *before* they occur, and proactively switches node roles to mitigate these issues. This goes beyond simply *closing* open loops; it *avoids* them forming in the first place by pre-emptively strengthening vulnerable areas.

**Specifications:**

*   **Node Classification:** Each node maintains a 'stability score' based on:
    *   Link quality to immediate neighbors (RSSI, throughput).
    *   Historical link fluctuations (standard deviation of link quality).
    *   Node degree (number of connected neighbors).
    *   Traffic load (packets per second).
    *   Battery level (if applicable).
*   **Predictive Algorithm:** A time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) running *on each node* analyzes its stability score and the stability scores of its immediate neighbors.  The model predicts the likelihood of a link failure or significant congestion within a defined timeframe (e.g., 5-15 seconds).
*   **Role Switching Protocol:**
    *   **Backup Role Assignment:** Nodes are pre-assigned 'backup roles' â€“ alternate functions they can assume if a primary node fails or becomes congested. Examples:
        *   Gateway Node Backup:  A node designated to take over gateway duties.
        *   Routing Node Backup:  A node designated to re-route traffic around a failing node.
        *   Traffic Distribution Node: A node taking on load balancing duties.
    *   **Proactive Switching:**  If a node predicts a high probability of link failure or congestion, it *initiates* a role switch with its designated backup node *before* the issue manifests. This is a coordinated process.
    *   **Switching Procedure:**
        1.  Predicting Node:  Signals the Backup Node with the switch request, including the reason for the switch (predicted failure/congestion).
        2.  Backup Node: Confirms availability.
        3.  Predicting Node:  Begins transferring routing information and/or traffic load to the Backup Node.
        4.  Backup Node: Assumes the new role.
        5.  Predicting Node:  Transitions to a standby mode or reconfigures to optimize for resilience.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  The predictive model learns from past events (actual link failures/congestion) to improve its accuracy over time. This is achieved through a centralized or distributed machine learning framework.
*   **Beaconing and Health Checks:** Nodes periodically broadcast 'health beacon' signals, containing their stability scores and current roles. This allows neighboring nodes to monitor the network's overall health and proactively prepare for potential issues.
*   **Security Considerations:** Implement secure communication protocols and authentication mechanisms to prevent malicious nodes from disrupting the role switching process.

**Pseudocode (Node Role Switching):**

```
// Node Class
class Node {
    int nodeID;
    float stabilityScore;
    string currentRole;
    string backupRole;
    Node backupNode;

    // Function to predict stability score for the next X seconds
    float predictStabilityScore(int timeHorizon) {
        // Implement time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM)
        // Use historical stability data
        return predictedStabilityScore;
    }

    // Function to initiate role switch
    void initiateRoleSwitch(Node backupNode) {
        // Signal backup node with switch request
        sendSignal(backupNode, "ROLE_SWITCH_REQUEST", currentRole, backupRole);
        // Transfer routing information
        transferRoutingInfo(backupNode);
        //Transition to standby
        currentRole = "STANDBY";
    }

    // Function to handle role switch request
    void handleRoleSwitchRequest(Node requestingNode, string currentRole, string backupRole) {
        // Confirm availability
        sendSignal(requestingNode, "ROLE_SWITCH_ACCEPTED");
        //Receive routing information
        receiveRoutingInfo(requestingNode);
        //Assume new role
        currentRole = backupRole;
    }
}

//Main Loop
while(true){
    //Calculate stability score
    stabilityScore = calculateStabilityScore();
    //Predict stability score
    predictedStabilityScore = predictStabilityScore(5);
    //If predicted score is below threshold initiate role switch
    if(predictedStabilityScore < threshold){
        initiateRoleSwitch(backupNode);
    }
}
```
