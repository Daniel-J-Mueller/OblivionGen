## Dynamic Voxel Resolution with Adaptive Sub-Volume Selection

**Concept:** Extend the voxelized representation generation to incorporate dynamic voxel resolution based on local feature density and an adaptive sub-volume selection process for training data. This allows for more efficient memory usage, faster training, and potentially improved model accuracy by focusing computational resources on the most informative regions of the 3D point clouds.

**Specifications:**

**1. Pre-Processing: Adaptive Voxelization & Sub-Volume Extraction**

*   **Input:** 3D Point Cloud (as per Patent â€“ Claim 2)
*   **Process:**
    *   **Initial Voxel Grid:** Create a coarse voxel grid covering the entire point cloud.
    *   **Density Calculation:**  For each voxel, calculate a density metric (e.g., number of points, variance of point normals).
    *   **Dynamic Resolution Adjustment:**
        *   **High Density:** If the density exceeds a threshold, subdivide the voxel into 8 child voxels. Repeat recursively up to a maximum resolution.
        *   **Low Density:**  Merge voxels with densities below a threshold with neighboring voxels.
    *   **Sub-Volume Selection:**
        *   Identify regions with high-resolution voxels (indicative of complex geometry).
        *   Extract cubic sub-volumes centered around these high-resolution regions.  Sub-volume size is configurable.
        *   Randomly sample a subset of these sub-volumes for training, ensuring a balanced representation of different object parts (leveraging Claim 4 part labels).  Prioritize sub-volumes containing unique features.
*   **Output:** A set of sub-volumes, each represented as a voxel grid, with varying resolution based on local point density.  Associated metadata includes: object ID, part label (if available), sub-volume coordinates, and voxel resolution.

**2. Sparse Convolution Adaptation**

*   **Input:** Sub-volume voxel grids, sparse convolution filters, stride values (as per Patent - Claim 1 & 6).
*   **Process:**
    *   Modify the sparse convolution implementation to handle variable voxel resolutions within a single batch.
    *   Track voxel resolution information during convolution. This ensures correct filter application and feature extraction at different scales.
    *   Implement a resolution-aware activation function. This allows for dynamic weighting of features based on voxel size.  Smaller voxels (higher resolution) could receive higher weight.

**3. Training Procedure**

*   **Input:**  Sparse convolution network (as per Patent - Claim 1), training data (sub-volumes), training parameters.
*   **Process:**
    *   Batch training with sub-volumes of varying resolution.
    *   Loss function should include a regularization term that penalizes excessive variation in voxel resolution.  This encourages a more consistent and efficient voxelization scheme.
    *   Utilize Claim 8 layer insertion and filter addition within the convolutional network but focus on layers processing sub-volumes.
    *   Implement Claim 9-15 activation, batch normalization, downsampling and upsampling *within* each sub-volume during training.
    *   Leverage Claim 16's hash tables and rule books to store information about the relationship between voxel resolution, sub-volume location, and extracted features.

**4. System Integration**

*   Extend the system described in Claim 19 to incorporate the dynamic voxelization and sub-volume extraction pipeline.
*   The processors should be capable of handling variable voxel resolutions during convolution and training.
*   The non-transitory memory should be sufficient to store the sub-volumes, associated metadata, and the sparse convolution network.

**Pseudocode (Sub-Volume Extraction):**

```python
def extract_sub_volumes(point_cloud, voxel_size, max_resolution, sub_volume_size):
  # Create initial coarse voxel grid
  voxels = create_voxel_grid(point_cloud, voxel_size)

  # Calculate density for each voxel
  densities = calculate_voxel_densities(voxels)

  # Adapt voxel resolution based on density
  refined_voxels = adapt_voxel_resolution(voxels, densities, max_resolution)

  # Identify regions with high-resolution voxels
  high_res_regions = find_high_resolution_regions(refined_voxels)

  # Extract sub-volumes
  sub_volumes = []
  for region in high_res_regions:
    sub_volume = extract_sub_volume(refined_voxels, region, sub_volume_size)
    sub_volumes.append(sub_volume)

  return sub_volumes
