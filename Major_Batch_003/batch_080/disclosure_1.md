## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Filtering

**Concept:** Extend the media effect ranking system to incorporate real-time emotional analysis of the scene *and* the user, then dynamically filter/blend effects to create a personalized emotional resonance.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Integration:** Integrate data from the client device’s camera (facial expression analysis – micro-expressions), microphone (voice tone analysis), and potentially wearable sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance).
*   **Scene Emotional Analysis:** Implement an AI model to analyze the landscape content for inherent emotional cues. This includes:
    *   Color palette analysis (warm/cool tones, saturation).
    *   Object/scene recognition (beach = tranquility, stormy sky = drama).
    *   Composition analysis (leading lines, symmetry, rule of thirds).
*   **User Emotional State Determination:** Employ the sensor data to estimate the user’s current emotional state (joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutral).  A multi-layered model combining facial expression, vocal tone and physiological data is preferred. Utilize Bayesian networks to handle uncertainty.
*   **Effect Emotional Tagging:**  Each media effect in the repository is tagged with a vector of emotional associations (e.g., “vintage” = nostalgia, warmth; “grayscale” = melancholy, drama; "bloom" = happiness, lightness).
*   **Resonance Algorithm:**
    1.  Calculate the *scene emotional vector* based on the scene analysis.
    2.  Calculate the *user emotional vector* based on sensor data.
    3.  For each available media effect, calculate a *resonance score* based on the similarity between the effect's emotional tag, the scene emotional vector, and the user emotional vector. Use cosine similarity or a similar metric.
    4.  Rank effects based on the resonance score.
    5.  Implement a *blend factor* allowing for effects to be combined. The blend factor is determined by the degree of emotional alignment/misalignment. A high alignment leads to a stronger application of the top-ranked effect. Misalignment can create subtle blends or even introduce counter-effects.
*   **Client-Side Processing:**  The majority of emotional analysis and effect blending should occur on the client device to minimize latency and maintain privacy.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  All sensor data processing must be done locally, with no data transmitted to the cloud. Users should have full control over sensor data access and be able to disable the emotional analysis features.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to calibrate the system by providing feedback on effect selections or manually adjusting the emotional response parameters.

**Pseudocode (Effect Selection):**

```
function select_effect(scene_data, user_data, effect_repository):
  scene_emotion_vector = analyze_scene(scene_data)
  user_emotion_vector = analyze_user(user_data)

  for effect in effect_repository:
    effect_emotion_vector = effect.emotional_tag
    resonance_score = cosine_similarity(effect_emotion_vector, scene_emotion_vector, user_emotion_vector)
    effect.resonance_score = resonance_score

  ranked_effects = sort(effects, by=resonance_score, descending=True)

  #Determine Blend Factor
  blend_factor = calculate_blend_factor(scene_emotion_vector, user_emotion_vector)

  selected_effect = ranked_effects[0]
  apply_effect(selected_effect, blend_factor)

  return selected_effect
