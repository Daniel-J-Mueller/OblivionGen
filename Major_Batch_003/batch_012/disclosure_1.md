## Dynamic Contextual Media Bubbles

**Concept:** Expand the “photo space” concept into a persistent, dynamically updating, 3D environment—a ‘bubble’—representing shared experiences with a specific user. This moves beyond static photos and videos into an evolving, interactive space.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Bubble Creation:** When a user interacts with another user’s icon, a personalized “bubble” is instantiated. This bubble isn’t a traditional profile, but a spatial environment.

2.  **Media Integration:**
    *   Photos & Videos: Core elements, arranged spatially within the bubble. Newer media appears closer to the ‘camera’ view.
    *   Live Data Streams: Integrate publicly available data (with user permission) relevant to shared experiences. Examples:
        *   Location data (past/present) - visualized as paths or hotspots.
        *   Shared music playlists (visualized as sound waves or a ‘jukebox’).
        *   Event check-ins (visualized as event posters/markers).
    *   AR/VR Integration: Allow users to contribute AR/VR "layers" to the bubble – 3D models, notes, sketches attached to specific memories/locations.

3.  **Spatial Navigation:**  Users navigate the bubble using standard 3D controls (pan, zoom, rotate). The layout isn’t pre-defined; it evolves based on the content.

4.  **Contextual Chat:**
    *   Chat messages are tied to specific objects/locations within the bubble.  Clicking a photo opens a chat thread relevant to that photo. Clicking a location marker opens a chat discussing that place.
    *   AI-Assisted Summarization:  An AI analyzes the content within a specific area of the bubble and generates a short summary to prime the conversation.

5.  **Bubble Persistence & Evolution:**
    *   Bubbles are persistent—they aren't cleared after a conversation.
    *   Bubbles evolve over time with new content, representing the ongoing history of the relationship.
    *   Privacy controls allow users to restrict access to their bubbles.

**Pseudocode (Core Bubble Update Logic):**

```
function UpdateBubble(user1, user2) {
    // Fetch shared media (photos, videos, etc.)
    sharedMedia = GetSharedMedia(user1, user2);

    // Fetch shared location history
    sharedLocations = GetSharedLocationHistory(user1, user2);

    // Fetch other shared data streams (music, events, etc.)
    sharedData = GetSharedDataStreams(user1, user2);

    // Create 3D environment
    bubble = Create3DEnvironment();

    // Populate bubble with content
    for (media in sharedMedia) {
        AddMediaToBubble(bubble, media);
    }

    for (location in sharedLocations) {
        AddLocationMarkerToBubble(bubble, location);
    }

    for (data in sharedData) {
        AddDataVisualizationToBubble(bubble, data);
    }

    // Return updated bubble
    return bubble;
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Bubble Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to contribute to a shared bubble.
*   **AI-Generated Bubble Themes:**  AI analyzes the content of the bubble and suggests visual themes and layouts.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:** Add haptic feedback to enhance the sense of immersion and presence.
