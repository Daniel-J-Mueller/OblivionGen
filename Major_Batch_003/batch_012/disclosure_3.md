## Dynamic Haptic Zoom & Focus

**Concept:** Expand the single-interface haptic control to include *continuous* zoom and focus adjustments during both photo and video capture, leveraging varying pressure and gesture speeds. This moves beyond simple start/stop functionality and introduces nuanced control.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor:** High-resolution pressure sensor integrated into the touch-sensitive surface. Must detect both force *and* velocity of contact.  Consider capacitive or piezoelectric sensors.
*   **Calibration:**  Initial calibration routine. User defines 'minimum' and 'maximum' zoom/focus levels for the current lens/camera configuration.
*   **Zoom Control:**
    *   Single-finger press & slide (horizontal).
    *   Pressure sensitivity: Lighter pressure = slower zoom speed. Heavier pressure = faster zoom speed.
    *   Direction of slide determines zoom-in or zoom-out.
    *   Haptic feedback: Subtle vibrations indicate zoom level changes, increasing in intensity as max/min zoom is approached.
*   **Focus Control:**
    *   Single-finger press & slide (vertical).
    *   Pressure sensitivity: Lighter pressure = finer focus adjustment. Heavier pressure = coarser focus adjustment.
    *   Direction of slide determines move focus closer or further.
    *   Autofocus Assist: If user hesitates with medium pressure, the system briefly engages autofocus to assist finding a clear focus point.
*   **Combined Control:**  Diagonal sliding gestures allow simultaneous zoom and focus adjustment.  Pressure dictates the *ratio* of zoom/focus change (e.g., heavy pressure = more zoom, light pressure = more focus).
*   **Video Mode Enhancement:** In video mode, continuous pressure/gesture updates allow for 'rack focus' or 'dolly zoom' effects in real-time, all controlled via the single interface.
*   **Integration with Existing System:** The haptic engagement signal from the source patent still initiates capture (photo or video), but the *degree* of ongoing haptic input now controls additional parameters.
*   **Software Pseudocode (Focus Adjustment):**

```pseudocode
function adjustFocus(pressure, slideVelocity, currentFocus):
    sensitivityFactor = map(pressure, 0, maxPressure, 0.1, 1.0) // Map pressure to sensitivity
    focusChange = slideVelocity * sensitivityFactor * focusAdjustmentRate
    newFocus = currentFocus + focusChange

    // Clamp newFocus within min/max focus limits
    newFocus = constrain(newFocus, minFocus, maxFocus)

    return newFocus
```

*   **Materials:** Seamless integration with existing device casing, prioritizing tactile feedback and durability.
