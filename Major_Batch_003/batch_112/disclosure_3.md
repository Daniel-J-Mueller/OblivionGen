## Shared Sensory Experience Linking - "Synesthesia Station"

**Concept:** Expand the shared music station concept to incorporate *other* sensory data alongside music, and allow users to ‘broadcast’ these sensory experiences to the group, fostering a richer, more immersive shared experience. The core idea is to move beyond simply listening *to* music together, to *feeling* it together via synchronized sensory input.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Requirements:** User devices (phones, tablets, smartwatches) with:
    *   Microphone
    *   Camera
    *   Haptic Feedback Engine
    *   Optional: Ambient Light Sensor, Temperature Sensor
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Sensory Capture Module:** Captures audio, video, haptic data, and (optionally) ambient light/temperature from the user’s device.  Prioritizes low-latency capture.
    *   **Sensory Mapping Engine:** Translates captured sensory data into standardized ‘sensory packets’. This ensures compatibility across diverse devices.  Examples:  Audio is encoded as standardized waveform data; Video is encoded as standardized video frames; Haptic feedback is mapped to standardized vibration patterns.
    *   **Synesthesia Broadcast Module:** Facilitates real-time broadcasting of sensory packets to members of the shared station. Uses a UDP-based protocol for low latency.
    *   **Sensory Playback Module:** Receives sensory packets and renders them on the user’s device. 
        *   **Audio Playback:** Standard audio playback.
        *   **Video Playback:** Standard video playback, optionally displayed in a Picture-in-Picture mode alongside the music app interface.
        *   **Haptic Playback:** Drives the device’s haptic engine to reproduce the received haptic patterns. Intensity and pattern should be adjustable.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   **"Sensory Cast" Button:**  Allows a user to initiate a sensory broadcast.
    *   **Sensory Feed View:** Displays a live feed of sensory data being broadcast by the current caster. This could be a visual representation of the audio waveform, a live video feed of the caster's environment (optional), and/or a visual representation of the haptic patterns.
    *   **Sensory Intensity Slider:** Allows users to adjust the intensity of the received sensory data.
    *   **Sensory Filter:** Allows users to selectively block or prioritize certain types of sensory data (e.g., block video but receive audio and haptic feedback).

**Pseudocode (Simplified - Sensory Cast Initiation):**

```
// On User Initiates "Sensory Cast"

function initiateSensoryCast() {
  // 1. Check if another user is currently casting. If so, request permission to override.
  if (isAnotherUserCasting()) {
    // Prompt user to confirm override
    if (userConfirmsOverride()) {
      // Signal the existing caster to stop
      signalCasterToStop()
    } else {
      return // Cancel cast initiation
    }
  }

  // 2. Start capturing sensory data (audio, video, haptics)
  startSensoryCapture()

  // 3. Begin broadcasting sensory data to group members
  broadcastSensoryData(capturedSensoryData)

  // 4. Update UI to indicate casting status
  updateUICastingStatus(true)
}
```

**Novelty:**

This system goes beyond simply sharing music. It creates a shared *sensory* experience, leveraging multiple senses to enhance the sense of connection and immersion. The ability to ‘cast’ sensory data opens up new possibilities for remote collaboration, entertainment, and social interaction. Imagine a remote musician performing and broadcasting not just audio, but also the vibrations of their instrument, or a group of friends sharing a sunset view *and* the feeling of the breeze.
