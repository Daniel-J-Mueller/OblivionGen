## Dynamic Masking & Affective Audio Response

**Concept:** Extend dynamic mask application to incorporate real-time audio analysis and affective computing, creating masks that *react* to both facial expression *and* vocal tone/emotion. This moves beyond static or triggered masks to a more immersive and responsive experience.

**Specs:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Audio Input Module:** Captures audio stream from input device (microphone, video source with audio).
*   **Affective Audio Analysis Engine:**
    *   **Feature Extraction:** Extracts relevant acoustic features (pitch, timbre, energy, spectral centroid, MFCCs, etc.).
    *   **Emotion Classification:** Uses a trained machine learning model (e.g., RNN, CNN, Transformer) to classify emotion from acoustic features (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, fear, neutral). Confidence scores are generated for each emotion.
*   **Facial Expression Recognition Module:** (Existing component from source patent). Identifies facial expressions and emotions.
*   **Fusion Engine:** Combines emotion data from audio & facial expression analysis. Weighted averaging, rule-based systems, or another ML model determines a *combined* emotional state.
*   **Dynamic Mask Library:** An expanded library of masks with associated emotional profiles (e.g., "happy sparkle," "angry glitch," "sad watercolor").  Each profile defines how the mask's visual effects (color, intensity, shape, animation) respond to different levels of combined emotional input.
*   **Mask Rendering Engine:** Applies the selected mask to the input image/video stream, dynamically adjusting visual effects based on the Fusion Engine's output.

**II.  Data Flow & Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Main Loop
while (video_stream_active) {
    frame = capture_frame()
    audio_sample = capture_audio()

    // Analyze Facial Expression
    facial_emotion, facial_confidence = analyze_facial_expression(frame)

    // Analyze Audio
    audio_emotion, audio_confidence = analyze_audio(audio_sample)

    // Fuse Emotions
    combined_emotion, combined_confidence = fuse_emotions(facial_emotion, facial_confidence, audio_emotion, audio_confidence)

    // Select Mask
    selected_mask = select_mask(combined_emotion, combined_confidence, user_preferences, social_data)

    // Apply Mask
    output_frame = apply_mask(frame, selected_mask, combined_emotion, combined_confidence)

    display_frame(output_frame)
}
```

**III. Mask Profiles & Response Examples:**

*   **"Happy Sparkle"**: Increased sparkle intensity & color saturation with increasing combined happiness levels. Faster sparkle animation.
*   **"Angry Glitch"**:  Higher frequency & intensity of glitch effects as combined anger increases. Color shifts to red/orange.
*   **"Sad Watercolor"**: Mask becomes more transparent & blurry with increasing sadness. Color palette shifts towards blues/greys. Watercolor effects intensify (more visible brushstrokes).
*   **"Fearful Static"**:  Static increases in frequency & coverage with increasing fear. Mask color desaturates to grayscale.  Random flickering effects.

**IV. Additional Features:**

*   **User Customization:** Allow users to create & upload custom mask profiles with defined emotional responses.
*   **Social Integration:**  Share masks & emotional responses with friends on social networks.  Create collaborative masks that react to multiple usersâ€™ emotions in real-time.
*   **Environmental Awareness:** Integrate with environmental sensors (e.g., noise levels, lighting) to influence mask selection and response.  A noisy environment might trigger a more aggressive or chaotic mask.
* **Real-time parameterization**: Allow in-stream adjustment of mask parameters via audio input. For example, whistling could change a mask's color, or clapping could alter its intensity.
*   **Mask layering**: Allow multiple masks to be applied simultaneously, with complex interactions between their effects based on emotional input.
