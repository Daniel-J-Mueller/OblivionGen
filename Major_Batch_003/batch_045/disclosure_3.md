## Dynamic Scene Reconstruction & Predictive Interaction

**Concept:** Extend the coreference resolution system to actively *reconstruct* a 3D understanding of the visual scene and *predict* likely user interactions based on gaze, gesture, and historical data. This moves beyond simply identifying objects to anticipating user intent *before* a fully-formed request is made, allowing for proactive assistance.

**Specs:**

**1. 3D Scene Reconstruction Module:**

*   **Input:** Visual data stream (images/video), depth data (if available - e.g. from AR/VR headsets or depth cameras), user gaze data, user gesture data.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Employ a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) or similar implicit representation to build a dynamic 3D model of the scene.
    *   Fuse visual, depth, gaze, and gesture data to refine the 3D model in real-time.  Gaze data prioritizes refinement in the user’s focal point. Gestures indicate areas of interest.
    *   Maintain a history of scene reconstructions to track object movement and changes over time.
*   **Output:** Dynamic 3D scene representation (point cloud, mesh, NeRF).

**2. Interaction Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Dynamic 3D scene representation, user gaze data, user gesture data, dialog state (from existing patent’s NLU module), user profile, historical interaction data (individual & aggregate).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Behavioral Modeling:** Train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Transformer model to predict likely user actions (e.g., "pick up", "move", "ask about") based on the input data.  Separate models for different object types (e.g., furniture, tools, food).
    *   **Contextual Analysis:**  Consider the current scene context (e.g., kitchen, living room, workshop) and user's current activity (inferred from dialog state and scene analysis).
    *   **Probability Scoring:** Assign a probability score to each predicted action based on the model output and contextual analysis.
*   **Output:** Ranked list of predicted user actions with associated probability scores.

**3. Proactive Assistance Module:**

*   **Input:** Ranked list of predicted user actions, dynamic 3D scene representation, dialog state.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Thresholding:**  If the probability score of a predicted action exceeds a predefined threshold, trigger a proactive response.
    *   **Response Generation:**  Generate a relevant response based on the predicted action and scene context. This could include:
        *   Displaying helpful information about the target object (e.g., "This is a Phillips head screwdriver").
        *   Offering to perform the action on behalf of the user (e.g., "Would you like me to move the cup?").
        *   Suggesting related actions (e.g., "You're looking at the wrench. Do you need a socket?").
*   **Output:**  Instructions for the client system to provide a proactive response to the user.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Assistance Module):**

```
function generateProactiveResponse(predictedActions, scene, dialogState):
  for action in predictedActions:
    if action.probability > threshold:
      if action.type == "informationRequest":
        response = generateInformationResponse(action.targetObject)
      elif action.type == "taskRequest":
        response = generateTaskConfirmationPrompt(action.task, action.targetObject)
      elif action.type == "suggestion":
        response = generateSuggestionPrompt(action.suggestion)
      sendResponseToClient(response)
      break // Only send one proactive response at a time
```

**Additional Notes:**

*   The system could be integrated with AR/VR environments to provide immersive and intuitive interactions.
*   Privacy considerations are important - user data should be anonymized and stored securely.
*   The threshold for triggering proactive responses should be adjustable based on user preferences.
