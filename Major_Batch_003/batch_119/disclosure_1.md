## Adaptive Broadcast Splitting with Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend dual-streaming to *n*-streaming, dynamically splitting a live broadcast into multiple streams targeted at different network nodes, but *predictively* based on viewer density *and* anticipated network congestion, not just static bandwidth availability. This goes beyond simple redundancy for improved quality and scalability.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** "Broadcast Splitter" – a software module integrated into the recording device (or streaming platform’s ingest point).
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   User Information (as in the patent).
    *   Real-time viewer density data per geographic region (aggregated from platform analytics).
    *   Historical network performance data per region (latency, packet loss, bandwidth).
    *   Predicted event data: Major regional events (concerts, sports, news) that will affect network load. This data sourced from third-party APIs.
    *   Broadcast content analysis: Bitrate, resolution, codec.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Initial Split:** Based on user settings and initial viewer density, calculate *n* (number of streams) to create. Default *n*=2.
    2.  **Node Selection:** Identify optimal network nodes (data centers) to distribute streams based on proximity to viewer concentrations and current network health.
    3.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously monitor viewer density and network conditions.
        *   If viewer density increases in a region: Increase the number of streams directed to nearby nodes.
        *   If network congestion increases: Reduce the bitrate of streams directed to affected nodes *or* shift traffic to less congested nodes.
        *   If viewer density drops: Reduce the number of streams, consolidating traffic.
    4.  **Predictive Scaling:** Utilize historical data and event predictions to proactively scale the number of streams *before* peak demand.
    5.  **Stream Prioritization:** If resources are constrained, prioritize streams based on viewer count, subscription level, or content type.
*   **Output:** Multiple independent streams of the live broadcast directed to different network nodes.
*   **Communication:**
    *   Broadcast Splitter communicates with the streaming platform’s load balancing system to coordinate stream distribution.
    *   Regular reporting of stream health and performance metrics.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function split_broadcast(user_info, content_info, platform_data):
    n = initial_split_calculation(user_info, platform_data)
    node_list = select_nodes(platform_data, n)
    stream_list = create_streams(content_info, node_list)

    while streaming:
        viewer_density = get_viewer_density()
        network_health = get_network_health()
        predicted_load = get_predicted_load()

        if viewer_density > threshold or predicted_load > threshold:
            n = increase_split(n)
            new_nodes = add_nodes(node_list, n)
            distribute_streams(stream_list, new_nodes)

        if viewer_density < threshold:
            n = decrease_split(n)
            remove_nodes(node_list, n)
            consolidate_streams(stream_list)

        if network_health < threshold:
            adjust_bitrate(stream_list) or shift_traffic(stream_list)

        report_metrics(stream_list)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved viewing experience (reduced latency, fewer buffering events).
*   Enhanced scalability to handle massive concurrent viewers.
*   Optimized network resource utilization.
*   Proactive response to network congestion and disruptions.
