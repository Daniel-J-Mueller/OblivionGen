## Dynamic Narrative Insertion

**Concept:** Expand beyond pose and visual insertion. Leverage the segmentation and pose estimation to infer narrative context and dynamically adjust the inserted target person's *actions* and subtle expressions to better align with the existing scene's implied story.

**Specs:**

1.  **Narrative Engine Integration:** Integrate a lightweight narrative engine (rule-based or LLM-driven) capable of analyzing the first image (context) for implied narrative elements: relationships between people, activity type, emotional tone, etc.

2.  **Action Library:** Develop a comprehensive library of 'micro-actions' – subtle body movements, facial expressions, and gaze directions – categorized by narrative context (e.g., 'observing', 'agreeing', 'disagreeing', 'comforting', ‘threatening’). Each micro-action is associated with pose keypoint adjustments and facial expression parameters.

3.  **Contextual Analysis Module:**
    *   Analyzes the first image for dominant narrative cues. Outputs a 'narrative profile' – a weighted vector representing the probability of various narrative elements being present.
    *   Identifies individuals in the first image and infers their relationships based on proximity, gaze direction, and body language.

4.  **Target Person Action Selection Module:**
    *   Based on the narrative profile and the relationships between people in the first image, select the most appropriate micro-actions for the target person. This selection considers the target person's original pose and expression in the second image as a starting point.
    *   Prioritize micro-actions that create a coherent narrative flow – e.g., if the first image depicts a heated argument, select micro-actions for the target person that indicate either agreement with one side, disagreement with both, or an attempt to mediate.

5.  **Dynamic Pose & Expression Adjustment:**
    *   Modify the target segmentation mask to incorporate the selected micro-actions. This involves subtle adjustments to pose keypoints and facial expression parameters.
    *   Ensure that the adjusted pose and expression remain realistic and anatomically plausible.

6.  **Refined Blending and Compositing:**
    *   Utilize the blending masks (as described in the provided patent) to seamlessly composite the adjusted target person into the first image.
    *   Apply subtle shading and lighting adjustments to ensure that the target person appears naturally integrated into the scene.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: first_image (context), second_image (target), narrative_library

narrative_profile = analyze_context(first_image, narrative_library)
target_relationships = infer_relationships(first_image)

selected_actions = select_actions(narrative_profile, target_relationships, second_image)

adjusted_segmentation_mask = modify_mask(second_image, selected_actions)

third_image = generate_image(adjusted_segmentation_mask)

output_image = composite_images(first_image, third_image, blending_masks)

return output_image
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Interactive storytelling: Allow users to insert themselves into existing scenes and have their actions dynamically adjusted to fit the narrative.
*   Virtual actors: Create more believable and engaging virtual actors that can respond to their environment in a nuanced way.
*   Content creation: Automate the process of inserting characters into existing scenes, reducing the need for manual editing.
