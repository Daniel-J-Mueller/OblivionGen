## Adaptive Event Schema Generation & Drift Detection

**Concept:** Dynamically generate and refine event schemas based on incoming event data, and actively detect schema drift to maintain data quality and analysis accuracy. This builds on the idea of predicting event types, but moves beyond static definitions to a continuously evolving understanding of user behavior.

**Specs:**

1.  **Event Data Ingestion:** System receives event data (description, user info, metadata, contextual info) via SDK as described in the base patent.

2.  **Initial Schema Creation:** Upon initial data influx, a baseline event schema is automatically generated using NLP techniques (topic modeling, keyword extraction) on the incoming 'description' fields. This schema comprises event categories and associated keywords/attributes.

3.  **Schema Evolution Engine:**
    *   **New Event Detection:** Continuously monitor incoming event 'description' fields. Utilize anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., isolation forests, one-class SVMs) to identify event descriptions dissimilar to existing schema categories.
    *   **Schema Proposal Generation:** For anomalous events, propose a new schema category. This involves:
        *   Keyword extraction from the anomalous event description.
        *   Similarity comparison to existing categories (cosine similarity of keyword vectors).
        *   Automatic category naming using a generative language model (e.g., GPT-3) based on extracted keywords.
    *   **Human-in-the-Loop Validation:** Present proposed new categories (name & associated keywords) to a human analyst for review and approval.
    *   **Schema Update:** Upon approval, integrate the new category into the event schema.

4.  **Schema Drift Detection:**
    *   **Distribution Monitoring:** Track the distribution of keywords associated with each event category over time.
    *   **Statistical Tests:** Employ statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Chi-squared test) to detect significant changes in keyword distributions.
    *   **Drift Alerting:** Trigger alerts when schema drift is detected, indicating potential changes in user behavior or data quality issues.

5.  **Contextual Enrichment:** Enrich event data with contextual information (time, location, app ID, deep links) as detailed in the base patent. This data is incorporated into the schema evolution and drift detection algorithms to improve accuracy and sensitivity.

**Pseudocode (Schema Evolution Engine - Simplified):**

```
function process_event(event_data):
  description = event_data['description']
  keywords = extract_keywords(description)
  closest_category = find_closest_category(keywords, existing_categories)

  if similarity(keywords, closest_category) < threshold:
    new_category_name = generate_category_name(keywords)
    present_to_analyst(new_category_name, keywords)
    if analyst_approves():
      add_category(new_category_name, keywords)
  
  assign_event_to_category(event_data, closest_category)

function extract_keywords(text):
  # NLP techniques (TF-IDF, word embeddings) to extract keywords
  return keyword_list

function find_closest_category(keywords, categories):
  # Calculate similarity between keywords and category keywords (cosine similarity)
  return best_matching_category

function generate_category_name(keywords):
  # Use a language model to generate a descriptive category name
  return category_name
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `EventSchema`: Dictionary mapping event categories to sets of keywords.
*   `EventData`: Dictionary containing event description, user info, metadata, contextual info, and assigned category.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Adaptive user segmentation based on evolving behavior patterns.
*   Real-time anomaly detection and fraud prevention.
*   Automated feature engineering for machine learning models.
*   Dynamic personalization of user experiences.
