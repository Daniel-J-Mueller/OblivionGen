## Adaptive Content Mirroring with Haptic Feedback Synchronization

**Core Concept:** Extend the synchronized content display across multiple devices by adding synchronized haptic feedback. This creates a shared, immersive experience where users not only *see* the same content but *feel* it in a coordinated way.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Requirements:**
    *   Primary Display Device (initiator): Capable of sending synchronization signals & content.
    *   Secondary Display Devices (participants): Capable of receiving synchronization signals, displaying content, and generating coordinated haptic feedback.  All devices must have precise timing capabilities (sub-millisecond resolution). Must contain accelerometers and/or gyroscopes for orientation/motion data.
*   **Haptic System:**
    *   Utilize a range of haptic actuators (vibration motors, ultrasonic transducers, electro-tactile stimulators, small pneumatic/hydraulic systems) integrated into the device casing or wearable accessories (gloves, wristbands).  The choice of actuator depends on the type of haptic effect desired (localized vibration, texture simulation, pressure sensation).
    *   Actuator density should be sufficient to create convincing haptic illusions.
    *   Actuators *must* be addressable individually to create complex patterns.
*   **Synchronization Protocol:**
    *   A low-latency communication protocol (likely UDP multicast or a dedicated real-time protocol) is required to distribute synchronization signals.
    *   Signals include:
        *   Content frame/event identifiers.
        *   Haptic event identifiers.
        *   Timing data (timestamps).
        *   Spatial data (coordinates of haptic effects relative to device orientation and position).
        *   Haptic intensity/amplitude data.
        *   Device orientation/position data exchange (to calibrate haptic effects).
*   **Content Adaptation:**
    *   Content needs to be augmented with haptic metadata. This could be done during content creation or via a post-processing step.
    *   Metadata specifies which visual elements should trigger haptic feedback and how (intensity, frequency, type).
    *   A "Haptic Layer" is added to the content stream.
*   **Algorithm:**

    ```pseudocode
    // Primary Device
    function SendSynchronizedContent(content, hapticLayer):
      timestamp = GetCurrentTimestamp()
      Send(content, timestamp)
      Send(hapticLayer, timestamp)

    // Secondary Device
    function ReceiveContent():
      content, timestamp = Receive()
      hapticLayer, _ = Receive() //Disregard timestamp on haptic layer reception
      Display(content)
      ProcessHapticLayer(hapticLayer)

    function ProcessHapticLayer(hapticLayer):
      // Extract haptic events from layer.
      // For each haptic event:
      //   Calculate actuator activation pattern based on event parameters (position, intensity, type).
      //   Activate actuators accordingly.
    ```

*   **Calibration Routine:**
    *   Automatic calibration procedure to map visual elements to corresponding haptic sensations.
    *   Utilizes device sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes) to determine device orientation and position.
    *   Adjusts haptic output to compensate for device variations and user positioning.

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Collaborative gaming (feeling impacts, textures, etc. in sync).
    *   Remote training/surgery simulation (feeling virtual tools/tissues).
    *   Immersive storytelling/virtual experiences (feeling rain, wind, impacts).
    *   Accessibility features for visually impaired users (haptic representation of visual content).
