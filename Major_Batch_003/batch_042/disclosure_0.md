## Dynamic Prediction Mode Granularity

**Concept:** The provided patent focuses on optimizing rate-distortion cost calculation *per* prediction mode. This design proposes a system that dynamically adjusts the granularity of prediction modes *during* encoding, creating 'hybrid' modes tailored to specific video content. Instead of fixed, pre-defined modes, the encoder adapts and combines elements to achieve optimal compression.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** An FPGA-based co-processor alongside the main encoding hardware. This provides the flexibility to implement custom logic for mode blending.
*   **Core Component: Mode Blender:** A hardware module responsible for combining aspects of different prediction modes. It accepts inputs representing mode parameters (e.g., transform size, prediction direction, intra-prediction angle) and outputs a blended mode configuration.
*   **Blended Mode Library:** A hardware-implemented, dynamically updated lookup table containing pre-calculated blending coefficients. These coefficients determine the weight given to each constituent mode in the blended output.
*   **Content Analysis Module:** A pre-processor (hardware accelerated if possible) that analyzes short segments of the video stream. This module identifies characteristics (e.g., motion vector consistency, texture complexity, edge density) which inform the Mode Blender.
*   **Rate-Distortion Feedback Loop:** Integrates the blended mode into the existing rate-distortion optimization framework. The cost is calculated, and the blending coefficients are adjusted accordingly using a gradient-descent-like algorithm.
*   **Dynamic Coefficient Adjustment:**  A small embedded microcontroller, or a dedicated logic block within the FPGA, implementing a simple adaptive algorithm (e.g., stochastic gradient descent) to adjust the blending coefficients based on the calculated rate distortion cost.

**Pseudocode (Mode Blender operation):**

```
// Input:
//   - content_features:  Vector representing video content characteristics
//   - base_modes: Array of candidate base prediction modes
//   - blending_coefficients:  Array of weights for each base mode

function blend_modes(content_features, base_modes, blending_coefficients):
  blended_mode = {}

  //Iterate through mode parameters
  for each parameter in base_modes[0]:
    weighted_sum = 0
    for i in range(length(base_modes)):
      weighted_sum += blending_coefficients[i] * base_modes[i][parameter]
    blended_mode[parameter] = weighted_sum

  return blended_mode
```

**Workflow:**

1.  The Content Analysis Module processes a video segment.
2.  Based on the analysis, the system selects a set of candidate base prediction modes.
3.  The blending coefficients are initialized (e.g., equal weights).
4.  The Mode Blender generates a hybrid mode using the current coefficients.
5.  The rate-distortion cost for this blended mode is calculated.
6.  The blending coefficients are adjusted based on the cost.
7.  Steps 4-6 are repeated iteratively until convergence or a maximum iteration count is reached.
8.  The optimized blended mode is used for encoding the video segment.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased compression efficiency by tailoring prediction modes to specific content.
*   Greater flexibility in handling complex video sequences.
*   Potential for improved visual quality at a given bitrate.
