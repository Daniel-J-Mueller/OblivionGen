## Dynamic Prediction Mode Selection with Per-Region Complexity Analysis

**Concept:** Leverage per-region complexity analysis to dynamically adjust the prediction mode selection process, prioritizing computationally intensive modes only in regions where they demonstrably improve encoding efficiency. This aims to reduce overall encoding time without significant quality loss.

**Specification:**

**1. Per-Region Complexity Metric:**

*   **Input:** Raw video frame.
*   **Process:** Divide the frame into macroblocks (or similar partitioning). For each macroblock:
    *   Calculate Spatial Frequency Variance (SFV): Measure the variation in high-frequency components within the macroblock. Higher SFV indicates more complex textures.
    *   Calculate Motion Vector Dispersion (MVD): Estimate the spread of motion vectors within the macroblock. High MVD suggests complex motion.
    *   Combine SFV and MVD into a Complexity Score (CS):  `CS = α * SFV + β * MVD`.  (`α` and `β` are weighting factors, adjustable via profiling).
*   **Output:** A Complexity Map – a grid representing the CS for each macroblock in the frame.

**2. Adaptive Mode Selection:**

*   **Input:** Complexity Map, Frame to be encoded.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Thresholding:** Define multiple Complexity Thresholds (CT1, CT2, CT3…), corresponding to different levels of complexity.
    *   **Mode Prioritization:**
        *   Macroblocks with `CS < CT1`:  Prioritize simpler prediction modes (e.g., Intra prediction with fewer directional options, skip blocks, direct motion prediction). Limit the search space for more complex modes.
        *   `CT1 <= CS < CT2`:  Allow a broader search of prediction modes, including more directional Intra predictions and some Inter prediction options.
        *   `CT2 <= CS < CT3`:  Enable the full range of prediction modes, including advanced Inter prediction (e.g., multiple reference frames, weighted prediction) and complex Intra predictions.
        *   `CS >= CT3`:  Activate a ‘high-complexity’ mode – potentially increasing the computational cost even further if performance profiling demonstrates a diminishing return. This could involve multiple passes with different parameters.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously monitor encoding performance (bits per pixel, encoding time) and dynamically adjust the Complexity Thresholds and weighting factors (`α`, `β`) based on real-time data.

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   **Hardware Acceleration:** The Complexity Score calculation should be optimized for parallel processing using SIMD instructions or dedicated hardware accelerators.
*   **Parallel Processing:** The macroblock analysis and mode selection can be parallelized to further reduce encoding time.
*   **Profiling and Optimization:** Extensive profiling is crucial to determine optimal values for `α`, `β`, and the Complexity Thresholds for different video content and target bitrates.
*   **Integration with Existing Codec:** The proposed mechanism can be integrated with existing codecs (e.g., H.264, H.265, AV1) as a pre-processing step to guide the mode decision process.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function CalculateComplexityMap(frame):
  complexityMap = empty grid
  for each macroblock in frame:
    sfv = CalculateSpatialFrequencyVariance(macroblock)
    mvd = CalculateMotionVectorDispersion(macroblock)
    complexityScore = alpha * sfv + beta * mvd
    complexityMap[macroblock] = complexityScore
  return complexityMap

function AdaptiveModeSelection(frame, complexityMap):
  for each macroblock in frame:
    complexityScore = complexityMap[macroblock]
    if complexityScore < CT1:
      prioritizedModes = [simpleMode1, simpleMode2]
    elif complexityScore < CT2:
      prioritizedModes = [intermediateMode1, intermediateMode2, simpleMode1]
    elif complexityScore < CT3:
      prioritizedModes = [complexMode1, complexMode2, intermediateMode1, simpleMode1]
    else:
      prioritizedModes = [allModes]

    bestMode = FindBestMode(macroblock, prioritizedModes)
    Encode(macroblock, bestMode)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced encoding time without significant quality loss.
*   Improved resource utilization.
*   Adaptive to different video content and target bitrates.
*   Potential for hardware acceleration.
