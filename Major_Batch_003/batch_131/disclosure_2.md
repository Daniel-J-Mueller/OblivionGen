## Adaptive Pixel Interpolation for Enhanced Edge Width Search

**Concept:** The current patent focuses on caching neighbor pixels for edge width searches. This design proposes a dynamic pixel interpolation stage *prior* to edge width calculation, tailored to the characteristics of the video content. The goal is to create ‘synthetic’ neighbor pixels that improve the accuracy of edge width determination, especially in areas with high frequency detail or compression artifacts.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Adaptive Interpolation Engine (AIE)
*   **Integration Point:** Inserted between the frame buffer and the cache system described in the provided patent.
*   **Input:** Current processing block (pixels) and adjacent pixel data (limited window, e.g., 9x9) from frame buffer.
*   **Output:** Enhanced neighbor pixel data (for caching) and interpolated pixel data for current processing block.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Content Analysis:** A small, dedicated processing unit within the AIE analyzes the current processing block for local texture and edge density using a gradient-based filter. This produces a ‘complexity score’.
2.  **Interpolation Mode Selection:**  Based on the complexity score, the AIE selects an appropriate interpolation mode. Possible modes include:
    *   **Bilinear Interpolation:** Standard, low-complexity interpolation. Used for smooth areas.
    *   **Bicubic Interpolation:** Higher accuracy, more computationally intensive. Used for areas with moderate detail.
    *   **Edge-Directed Interpolation:** Interpolates new pixels *along* detected edges, enhancing the visibility of fine details. This uses an edge detection filter (e.g., Sobel) and prioritizes interpolation along edge orientations.
    *   **Artifact-Aware Interpolation:**  Detects compression artifacts (blocking, ringing) using DCT coefficient analysis (a simplified version applied to a small block) and employs a smoothing filter to reduce their impact on edge width calculation. This mode attempts to 'fill in' missing high-frequency information.
3.  **Neighbor Pixel Generation:** The selected interpolation mode is applied to generate synthetic neighbor pixels *beyond* the existing cached data. This expands the search window for edge width calculation, potentially improving accuracy in complex areas.
4.  **Cache Update:** The newly generated neighbor pixels are written to a dedicated section of the first level cache, supplementing the existing neighbor data.
5. **Dynamic Scaling:** A dynamic scaling factor adjusts the contribution of interpolated pixels versus cached pixels based on a confidence metric. This metric considers the interpolation mode, edge strength, and the quality of the original pixel data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: Current processing block (block), adjacent pixel data (adj_pixels)

function adaptive_interpolate(block, adj_pixels) {

  complexity_score = analyze_content(block)

  if (complexity_score < threshold_low) {
    interpolation_mode = bilinear
  } else if (complexity_score < threshold_high) {
    interpolation_mode = bicubic
  } else {
    if (artifact_detected(block)) {
      interpolation_mode = artifact_aware
    } else {
      interpolation_mode = edge_directed
    }
  }

  interpolated_neighbors = generate_neighbors(interpolated_mode, adj_pixels)

  confidence = calculate_confidence(interpolated_mode, block)

  weighted_neighbors = (1 - confidence) * cached_neighbors + confidence * interpolated_neighbors

  return weighted_neighbors
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Dedicated hardware blocks for gradient filtering, edge detection, DCT coefficient analysis, and interpolation (Bilinear, Bicubic, Edge-Directed, Artifact-Aware).
*   Small, high-speed memory to store intermediate interpolation results.
*   Configurable data paths to support different interpolation modes.
*   Integration with the existing cache system described in the patent.
