## Dynamic Locality Weighting for Hyperlocal Recommendations

**Concept:** Enhance the spectral clustering and tf-idf approach by dynamically weighting locality factors within the similarity graph *and* the tf-idf calculation based on real-time user behavior and event data. The original patent focuses on static distance and check-in data. This expands on that by incorporating temporal and event-driven locality.

**Specifications:**

**I. Similarity Graph Enhancement - Temporal Locality**

1.  **Data Sources:**
    *   Real-time user location data (anonymized).
    *   Event data (concerts, festivals, sports games, conferences, protests – sourced from APIs or web scraping).
    *   Traffic data (API integration).
    *   Public transportation schedules (API integration).

2.  **Dynamic Weighting Function:**
    *   `LocalityWeight(CityA, CityB, Timestamp)` = `DistanceFactor * DistanceWeight(CityA, CityB) + EventFactor * EventWeight(CityA, CityB, Timestamp) + TrafficFactor * TrafficWeight(CityA, CityB, Timestamp) + TransitFactor * TransitWeight(CityA, CityB, Timestamp)`
        *   `DistanceWeight`: Inverse proportional to distance (as in the original patent).
        *   `EventWeight`: Proportional to the number/magnitude of events happening concurrently in both cities.  Magnitude based on estimated attendance.
        *   `TrafficWeight`:  Represents the travel time between cities at the given `Timestamp`. Higher traffic = lower weight.
        *   `TransitWeight`: Represents the availability and frequency of public transportation options. Higher frequency = higher weight.
        *   `DistanceFactor`, `EventFactor`, `TrafficFactor`, `TransitFactor` are configurable parameters adjusted via machine learning to optimize recommendation relevance.

3.  **Similarity Graph Update Frequency:**  The similarity graph is dynamically updated at least every 15 minutes, incorporating new data from the sources above.

**II. Enhanced TF-IDF with Behavioral Locality**

1.  **Behavioral Signal Integration:**
    *   Track user interactions with pages (likes, shares, comments, clicks).
    *   Geotag these interactions (approximate location).
    *   Calculate a "Behavioral Locality Score" for each user-page pair, based on the distance between the user's interaction location and the page’s associated location (e.g., business address).

2.  **Modified TF-IDF Calculation:**
    *   TF (Term Frequency):  User interactions are the “documents”. Page “likes” become the “terms”.
    *   IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): Modified to incorporate Behavioral Locality Score.
        *   IDF = log(TotalNumberofUsers / NumberofUserswithBehavioralLocalityScoreaboveThreshold)
        *   Threshold is configurable.

3.  **Locality Filtering:**
    *   Before presenting recommendations, filter pages based on a minimum Behavioral Locality Score.  This prioritizes pages with demonstrated local relevance to the user.

**III. System Architecture & Pseudocode**

1.  **Data Ingestion Pipeline:**
    *   Real-time data streams from location services, event APIs, traffic APIs, public transit APIs.
    *   Data cleaning, validation, and normalization.

2.  **Graph Database:**
    *   Neo4j or similar graph database to store the similarity graph.
    *   Nodes: Cities, Pages
    *   Relationships:  “NEAR”, “EVENT_COOCCURRENCE”, “SIMILAR_PAGE” (based on content analysis – optional) – all weighted.

3.  **Recommendation Engine:**
    ```
    function GenerateRecommendations(UserID, UserLocation, Timestamp):
      // 1. Get User’s Geographic Sub-Region (City)
      City = GetCityFromLocation(UserLocation)

      // 2. Query Graph Database for Neighbors of City (Weighted)
      Neighbors = GetNeighbors(City, Timestamp)

      // 3. Get Pages Associated with Neighbors
      RelevantPages = GetPagesForNeighbors(Neighbors)

      // 4. Calculate TF-IDF for RelevantPages based on User Interactions
      TFIDF_Scores = CalculateTFIDF(RelevantPages, UserID, UserLocation)

      // 5. Filter Pages based on Minimum Behavioral Locality Score
      FilteredPages = FilterByLocality(FilteredPages, UserID, UserLocation)

      // 6. Sort Pages by TFIDF Score
      SortedPages = SortByTFIDF(FilteredPages)

      // 7. Return Top N Recommendations
      return TopN(SortedPages, 10)
    ```

**IV. Machine Learning Optimization:**

*   Use reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the `DistanceFactor`, `EventFactor`, `TrafficFactor`, `TransitFactor`, and the Behavioral Locality Score threshold to maximize user engagement (clicks, likes, shares).
*   A/B testing to evaluate different weighting strategies and filter parameters.
