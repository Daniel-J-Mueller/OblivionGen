## Dynamic Feature Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Specification:** A system for adaptively weighting features used in the machine learning model for evaluating candidate values, leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize weighting based on observed downstream impact.

**Components:**

*   **Feature Vector Module:** (Existing from patent) Generates the feature vector representing a candidate value, including data pipeline endorsements, user endorsements, and potentially other signals.
*   **RL Agent:** A deep Q-network (DQN) or policy gradient algorithm.
*   **Reward Function:** Measures the 'quality' of the best scoring candidate value *after* it is associated with the field in the page. This could be measured through:
    *   **User Engagement:** Click-through rates on the page after the change.
    *   **Conversion Rate:** Did the updated field lead to a desired action (e.g., purchase, form submission)?
    *   **Manual Validation Rate:** Percentage of times a human reviewer confirms the accuracy of the updated field.
*   **Weight Adjustment Module:** Modifies the weights assigned to each feature in the feature vector based on the actions (weight adjustments) suggested by the RL agent.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:**  To compare the performance of pages updated with the RL-adjusted feature weights against a control group using static weights.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Initialize RL Agent (DQN or Policy Gradient)
Initialize Feature Weights (e.g., all equal)
Initialize A/B Testing Framework

// Main Loop
For each candidate value evaluation request:
    Generate Feature Vector
    Calculate Score using current Feature Weights
    Determine Best Scoring Candidate Value
    Associate Best Scoring Candidate Value with Field in Page
    
    // A/B Test Assignment - Randomly assign page to A/B test group
    If page assigned to experiment group:
      Observe Reward (User Engagement, Conversion Rate, Manual Validation)
      RL Agent observes State (Feature Vector values) and Reward
      RL Agent suggests Weight Adjustment
      Apply Weight Adjustment to Feature Weights
    Else:
      //Control group: Use static feature weights
      
    Record Performance Metrics
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

The system learns which features are most predictive of *true* accuracy by directly observing the impact of its choices. Traditional feature engineering often relies on expert intuition or static analysis. This system allows the weights to adapt dynamically to changing data patterns and user behavior. For example, if user engagement drops after associating a specific field with a candidate value weighted heavily on a data pipeline endorsement, the RL agent will learn to reduce the weight of that data pipeline endorsement for similar cases in the future. The A/B testing framework is crucial for ensuring that the weight adjustments are genuinely improving performance. The reward function is the core component; its careful design is essential to align the RL agent's behavior with desired outcomes.
