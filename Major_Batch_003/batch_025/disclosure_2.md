## Haptic Audio Scene Reconstruction – “Echo Bloom”

**Concept:** Expand the audio-to-haptic translation beyond simple waveform mapping. Reconstruct a simplified “echo” of the audio scene using haptic feedback, providing spatial and environmental cues *in addition* to the direct sound representation.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multi-channel audio stream (stereo minimum, ideally spatial audio formats like Dolby Atmos or Ambisonics).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Scene Decomposition:** Utilize a sound event detection (SED) and source localization algorithm. Identify discrete sound events (e.g., speech, music, environmental sounds like rain, car passing) and estimate their 3D positions within a virtual space.
    2.  **Haptic “Echo” Generation:** For each identified sound event:
        *   **Delay & Attenuation:** Introduce a short delay (50-200ms) corresponding to the estimated distance of the sound source.  Apply attenuation based on distance and a simulated "absorption" factor (e.g., "open field" vs. "carpeted room").
        *   **Haptic Primitive Assignment:**  Map sound events to pre-defined haptic primitives. Examples:
            *   Low-frequency rumble = broad, sustained vibration across a larger area of the skin (back, chest).
            *   High-frequency transient (e.g., a cymbal crash) = short, sharp tap localized to a specific actuator.
            *   Speech = a subtle, rhythmic pulsing vibration corresponding to the speech envelope.
            *   Environmental sounds (rain, wind) = a granular, textured vibration across a wider area.
        *   **Spatialization:** Distribute the assigned haptic primitives across an array of cutaneous actuators strategically placed on the user’s body (back, shoulders, chest, arms). Actuator activation intensity and timing are modulated to simulate the perceived location of the sound source.
    3.  **Haptic “Base Layer”:** Maintain a conventional haptic representation of the core audio signal (as in the provided patent). This acts as a foundation upon which the “echo” is layered.
    4.  **Dynamic Mixing:** Implement a dynamic mixing algorithm to balance the intensity of the “base layer” and the “echo” based on user preferences and the characteristics of the audio content.
*   **Actuator Array:** High-density array of micro-actuators (e.g., piezoelectric, electro-tactile) strategically mapped to the user’s torso and limbs. Minimum density: 50 actuators/square foot.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   Real-time audio processing pipeline implemented in C++ or Python.
    *   Machine learning model trained to map sound event types to appropriate haptic primitives.
    *   Spatial audio rendering engine to calculate actuator activation patterns.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Adjustable parameters: “Echo Intensity”, “Echo Delay”, “Primitive Customization”, “Spatialization Scale”.
    *   Pre-set profiles for different audio genres (music, movies, games).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function processAudioFrame(audioFrame, actuatorArray) {
  soundEvents = detectSoundEvents(audioFrame)
  for (event in soundEvents) {
    distance = estimateDistance(event.position)
    delay = distance * propagationSpeed
    primitive = mapSoundEventToPrimitive(event.type)
    intensity = calculateIntensity(distance)
    actuatorPattern = createActuatorPattern(primitive, intensity, delay, event.position)
    applyActuatorPattern(actuatorArray, actuatorPattern)
  }

  baseHapticSignal = generateBaseHapticSignal(audioFrame)
  applyBaseHapticSignal(actuatorArray, baseHapticSignal)
}
```

**Novelty:** This isn’t merely translating audio to vibration, but *reconstructing* a simplified sonic environment via haptics. The addition of echo and spatial cues aims to provide a richer, more immersive experience than traditional audio-to-haptic systems. It moves beyond simple waveform reproduction to a more perceptually meaningful representation of sound.
