**Creator Account ‘Momentum’ Prediction & Proactive Resource Allocation**

**Concept:** Extend the prioritization system to *predict* which low-follower accounts are poised for rapid growth ("Momentum" accounts) and proactively allocate resources to amplify their reach *before* they hit the engagement threshold. This shifts from reactive prioritization to proactive incubation.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Momentum Score Calculation:**
    *   Introduce a ‘Momentum Score’ calculated *concurrently* with the existing Social Engagement Score.
    *   Momentum Score factors:
        *   *Recent Post Velocity:* Number of posts in the last X days (configurable).
        *   *Engagement Growth Rate:* Percentage increase in engagement (likes, comments, shares) over the last Y days.  Exponential smoothing applied to avoid noise.
        *   *Content Diversity Score:* A measure of the variety of content types posted (image, video, text, live stream, etc.). Higher diversity indicates wider appeal. Calculated using a content classification AI model.
        *   *Network Expansion Rate:* Rate at which the account is gaining new followers.
    *   Momentum Score Formula (Example):  `MS = (0.4 * PostVelocity) + (0.3 * EngagementGrowth) + (0.2 * ContentDiversity) + (0.1 * NetworkExpansion)`  (Weights are configurable).

2.  **‘Incubation’ Resource Allocation:**
    *   If an account meets a *predefined* Momentum Score threshold *and* remains below the follower threshold, it enters ‘Incubation’.
    *   Incubation resources:
        *   *Enhanced Algorithm Boost:*  Increase the probability of the account’s posts appearing in ‘For You’ feeds, even without high immediate engagement. This boost is *temporary* and decreases as the account’s organic reach increases.
        *   *Creator Spotlight Feature:*  Feature the account in a dedicated ‘Rising Creators’ section within the social media platform.
        *   *Targeted Promotion (Optional):*  Allocate a small budget for promoting the account’s content to a relevant audience. (User opt-in required).

3.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   Implement a dynamic follower threshold. The threshold adjusts based on overall platform growth and the distribution of creator accounts. This ensures that the prioritization system remains effective as the platform scales.

4.  **Resource Allocation Management System:**
    *   A centralized system to monitor resource allocation and track the performance of ‘Incubated’ creators.
    *   Metrics:
        *   Conversion Rate (Incubation to Prioritized)
        *   Average Follower Growth During Incubation
        *   Return on Investment (for targeted promotion)

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Logic):**

```
function allocateResources(creatorAccount) {
  if (creatorAccount.followerCount < followerThreshold && creatorAccount.momentumScore > momentumThreshold) {
    creatorAccount.incubationStatus = true
    boostAlgorithm(creatorAccount)
    featureInSpotlight(creatorAccount)
    //Optional: allocatePromotionBudget(creatorAccount)
  } else if (creatorAccount.incubationStatus == true && (creatorAccount.followerCount >= followerThreshold || creatorAccount.socialEngagementScore >= engagementThreshold)) {
    creatorAccount.incubationStatus = false
    removeBoost(creatorAccount)
    removeSpotlight(creatorAccount)
  }
}
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Momentum Score for each creator account.
*   Incubation Status (Boolean).
*   Resource Allocation History.
