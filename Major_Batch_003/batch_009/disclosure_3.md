## Personalized Feed "Temperature" Control

**Concept:** Extend the detrimental effect calculation to provide the user with granular control over the "temperature" of their feed. This isn't about content *blocking*, but about subtly shifting the weighting of algorithms based on a user-defined preference for novelty vs. familiarity, expressed as a "temperature" setting.

**Specs:**

*   **User Interface Element:** A slider (or similar control) within feed settings labelled "Feed Temperature". Range: 0-100.
    *   0 = "Familiar" - Prioritizes content aligning with established user interests, minimizing exposure to potentially jarring or unexpected content. Emphasis on high predicted engagement.
    *   50 = "Balanced" - Standard algorithm weighting.
    *   100 = "Novel" - Maximizes exposure to diverse content, even if predicted engagement is lower. Encourages exploration beyond established interests.
*   **Algorithm Adjustment:**  The "Feed Temperature" value modifies the weighting of several key factors within the content ranking algorithm:
    *   **Affinity Score:**  Higher "Temperature" values *decrease* the weight given to the user's affinity for a particular content item.  This reduces the bias towards established interests.
    *   **Diversity Score:** Introduces a new score measuring content diversity relative to the user’s historical consumption.  Higher “Temperature” values *increase* the weight of the Diversity Score.
    *   **Exploration Bonus:** Applies a small, random bonus to the ranking of content items outside of the user’s established interests. The size of this bonus is scaled by the “Temperature” setting.
*   **Detrimental Effect Integration:** The detrimental effect calculation (as described in the original patent) remains, but is *modulated* by the "Feed Temperature".
    *   A high "Temperature" setting *reduces* the weight given to the detrimental effect. This allows for more experimentation, even if it temporarily lowers engagement.
    *   A low "Temperature" setting *increases* the weight given to the detrimental effect, reinforcing a stable and predictable feed.
*   **Real-time Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors user engagement metrics (clicks, time spent, scrolls, etc.). These metrics are used to dynamically adjust the algorithm weights and refine the personalized "Temperature" profile.
*   **Data Collection:** Log user-defined temperature settings, engagement metrics for varying temperature settings, and content metadata.  This data is used to train a machine learning model to predict optimal temperature settings for individual users.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Algorithm Adjustment):**

```
// Input: Content Item, User Profile, Feed Temperature (0-100)
// Output: Adjusted Ranking Score

AffinityScore = CalculateAffinity(ContentItem, UserProfile)
DiversityScore = CalculateDiversity(ContentItem, UserProfile)
BaseRankingScore = (AffinityScore * 0.7) + (DiversityScore * 0.3)

// Temperature Scaling
TemperatureFactor = (100 - FeedTemperature) / 100  // Ranges from 0 to 1

AdjustedAffinityScore = AffinityScore * TemperatureFactor
AdjustedDiversityScore = DiversityScore * (1 - TemperatureFactor)

FinalRankingScore = (AdjustedAffinityScore * 0.7) + (AdjustedDiversityScore * 0.3)

// Detrimental Effect Adjustment
DetrimentalEffect = CalculateDetrimentalEffect(PlacementInfo)
DetrimentalWeight = 1 - (FeedTemperature / 100) // Scale detrimental effect based on temperature
FinalRankingScore -= DetrimentalEffect * DetrimentalWeight

return FinalRankingScore
