## Acoustic Beamforming for Enhanced Site Survey Data

**Concept:** Integrate acoustic beamforming techniques alongside the existing radio frequency (RF) beamforming to create a comprehensive site survey tool capable of mapping not only RF signal propagation but also ambient noise profiles and potential interference sources. This offers a more holistic understanding of the survey environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Ground Unit: Integrate a phased array of ultrasonic transducers alongside the existing RF beamforming antenna. Transducer array to operate in a frequency range of 20 kHz - 40 kHz.  Power output adjustable from 1mW to 100mW. Include a synchronized high-speed ADC to capture acoustic reflections.
    *   Elevated Unit: Implement an array of highly sensitive microphones, synchronized with the ground unit's acoustic transmission. Utilize MEMS microphones with a flat frequency response from 20 Hz to 80 kHz. Include a noise floor of < 20 dB SPL.
    *   Controller: Dedicated DSP module for acoustic beamforming processing. Real-time FFT and beam steering algorithms implemented in firmware.
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   Acoustic Beam Steering: Implement a Delay-and-Sum beamforming algorithm. Dynamic adjustment of beam direction synchronized with RF beam steering. Resolution: 1 degree.
    *   Ambient Noise Mapping:  Record and analyze ambient noise levels at each surveyed location. Generate a noise profile map overlaid with RF propagation data. Algorithm: Spectral subtraction.
    *   Interference Source Identification: Utilize acoustic beamforming to pinpoint the source of any detected acoustic interference.  Algorithm: Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) estimation.
    *   Data Fusion: Integrate acoustic and RF data. Visualization: 3D map displaying RF signal strength, noise levels, and interference sources.
*   **Operational Procedure:**
    1.  Ground unit transmits synchronized RF and acoustic signals.
    2.  Directionally adjustable beamforming antenna steers both signals through N beam directions.
    3.  Elevated unit receives and measures the magnitude and phase of both RF and acoustic signals.
    4.  Controller performs:
        *   RF signal processing as described in the original patent.
        *   Acoustic beamforming and data analysis.
        *   Data fusion and visualization.

**Pseudocode (Controller â€“ Acoustic Processing):**

```
// Input: Raw acoustic data from elevated unit
// Output: Noise profile, interference source locations

function processAcousticData(rawAcousticData) {

  // Apply calibration and filtering

  // Perform Delay-and-Sum beamforming

  for (each beam direction) {
    calculate delay for each microphone
    sum weighted signals based on delay
    calculate signal power
  }

  // Calculate noise profile
  noiseProfile = calculateNoiseLevel(signalPower)

  // Identify interference sources
  interferenceSources = findInterferenceSources(signalPower, noiseProfile)

  return noiseProfile, interferenceSources
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Improved base station placement based on noise and interference.
*   Identification of potential sources of RF interference.
*   More accurate site surveys in noisy environments.
*   Development of intelligent noise cancellation systems.
