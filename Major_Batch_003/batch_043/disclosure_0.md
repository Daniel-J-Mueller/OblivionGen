## Dynamic Content "Lifecycles" & Proactive Sharing Suggestions

**Specification:**

This system extends the core sharing functionality by introducing content lifecycles and proactive sharing suggestions, operating *outside* of direct user requests. It anticipates sharing needs based on content type, user interaction, and contextual awareness.

**Components:**

1.  **Content Lifecycle Manager:** This module tracks the "freshness" and relevance of generated content. Each content object is tagged with a decay rate (determined by content type â€“ e.g., news articles decay faster than creative writing).  A "relevance score" is calculated and continuously updated.

2.  **Interaction Analyzer:**  Monitors user interaction with generated content (views, edits, reactions). Increased interaction boosts the relevance score; inactivity decreases it.

3.  **Contextual Awareness Engine:** Accesses user profile data (relationships, interests, common activities) and current context (location, time, ongoing conversations).

4.  **Proactive Suggestion Generator:**  Combines the relevance score, interaction data, and contextual awareness to identify potential sharing opportunities.  It generates sharing suggestions *before* the user explicitly requests them.

5.  **Sharing Prioritization Algorithm:** Orders suggestions based on predicted user intent (e.g., "This article aligns with John's stated interest in AI," or "Sarah frequently shares travel photos").

**Workflow:**

1.  Content is generated within the dialog session.
2.  The Content Lifecycle Manager assigns a decay rate and initial relevance score.
3.  The Interaction Analyzer monitors user engagement.
4.  The Contextual Awareness Engine gathers relevant user data.
5.  The Proactive Suggestion Generator identifies potential sharing targets and generates suggestions.
6.  The Sharing Prioritization Algorithm orders the suggestions.
7.  The system presents suggestions to the user *without* a direct request, utilizing a non-intrusive UI element (e.g., a subtle notification or a dedicated "Sharing Insights" section).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Content Lifecycle Manager
function calculateRelevanceScore(content, decayRate, interactionScore):
    relevance = initialRelevance + (interactionScore * weightInteraction) - (timeElapsed * decayRate)
    return relevance

// Proactive Suggestion Generator
function generateSharingSuggestions(userProfile, content, context):
    potentialTargets = identifyPotentialTargets(userProfile, content, context)
    for target in potentialTargets:
        suggestion = createSuggestion(content, target)
        suggestion.relevance = calculateSuggestionRelevance(content, target, userProfile)
        suggestions.append(suggestion)
    return suggestions

// Calculate suggestion relevance:
function calculateSuggestionRelevance(content, target, userProfile):
    sharedInterests = calculateSharedInterests(userProfile, target)
    contentRelevance = content.relevanceScore
    relevance = sharedInterests * contentRelevance
    return relevance

//Identify potential targets:
function identifyPotentialTargets(userProfile, content, context):
  // Access User Profile
  potentialTargets = userProfile.connections
  // Filter connections based on shared interests or recent interactions
  filteredTargets = [target for target in potentialTargets if hasSharedInterest(target, content) or hasRecentInteraction(target, userProfile)]
  return filteredTargets
```

**UI Considerations:**

*   A "Sharing Insights" section within the assistant UI.
*   Subtle notifications highlighting potential sharing opportunities.
*   The ability for the user to customize the frequency and types of suggestions.
*   A "Why this suggestion?" explanation to provide transparency.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Automated sharing based on user-defined rules (e.g., "Automatically share travel photos with my family group").
*   Integration with other social platforms to streamline the sharing process.
*   The ability to generate personalized sharing messages.
