## Adaptive Notification Prioritization Based on Entity Relationship Strength

**Specification:** Implement a system to dynamically adjust notification priority for entity references within messaging threads based on the inferred strength of the relationship between the user receiving the notification and the entity being referenced.

**Core Concept:**  Current notification systems treat all entity references (mentions, invites, replies) equally. This proposal introduces a system that infers the strength of the relationship between the user and the referenced entity (another user, a group, a bot, etc.) and adjusts notification prominence accordingly.

**Components:**

1.  **Relationship Inference Engine:**  This component analyzes various data points to infer relationship strength. Data points include:
    *   **Interaction Frequency:** How often do the user and the referenced entity interact (direct messages, group messages, reactions)?
    *   **Recency of Interaction:** How recently did the interaction occur?
    *   **Contextual Interaction:** What *type* of interaction occurred? (e.g., critical task assignment vs. casual chat)
    *   **Explicit Relationship Data:**  Any explicitly defined relationships (e.g., "close friends" list, "colleagues" list).
    *   **Shared Group Membership:** Number of groups both users share.
    *   **Network Proximity:**  Degree of separation between users in a social graph.

    The engine outputs a "Relationship Strength Score" (RSS) ranging from 0 to 1.

2.  **Notification Priority Modulator:**  This component receives the RSS from the Relationship Inference Engine and uses it to adjust notification priority.  Priority levels are:
    *   **High:**  RSS > 0.75 (Critical/Close Relationship). Notification displays immediately, with sound and visual prominence.
    *   **Medium:** 0.25 < RSS <= 0.75 (Moderate Relationship). Notification displays with standard prominence.
    *   **Low:** RSS <= 0.25 (Weak/No Relationship). Notification is grouped/summarized or delayed.

3.  **Adaptive Notification UI:**  The UI adjusts notification display based on priority:
    *   **High Priority:**  Full-screen banner, distinct sound, vibration.
    *   **Medium Priority:** Standard notification bubble.
    *   **Low Priority:**  Notifications bundled in a "Less Important" section, displayed only when the user actively views notifications.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On receiving a notification with entity reference
relationshipStrength = CalculateRelationshipStrength(user, entity)

if relationshipStrength > 0.75:
  priority = HIGH
elif relationshipStrength > 0.25:
  priority = MEDIUM
else:
  priority = LOW

DisplayNotification(notification, priority)
```

**Function: CalculateRelationshipStrength(user, entity)**

```
// Analyze interaction frequency, recency, context, etc.
interactionCount = GetInteractionCount(user, entity)
lastInteractionTime = GetLastInteractionTime(user, entity)
interactionContextScore = GetInteractionContextScore(user, entity)

// Combine data points to generate RSS (example weighting)
rss = (0.4 * interactionCount) + (0.3 * lastInteractionTime) + (0.3 * interactionContextScore)

// Normalize RSS to range 0-1
rss = min(1, rss)
rss = max(0, rss)

return rss
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **User Customization:** Allow users to override the automatically assigned priority levels.
*   **Privacy:** Ensure user data used for relationship inference is handled securely and with appropriate privacy controls.
*   **Machine Learning:** Employ machine learning models to improve the accuracy of relationship inference over time.
*   **Integration with other services**: Utilize data from other services (e.g., calendar, email) to further enhance relationship inference.
