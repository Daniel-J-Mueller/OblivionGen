## Dynamic Impression Weighting via Biofeedback

**Core Concept:** Integrate real-time biometric data from users to dynamically adjust impression weights within the machine learning models. This moves beyond demographic/behavioral de-biasing to *physiological* de-biasing, and allows for more accurate reach inference.

**Specs:**

1.  **Biometric Data Acquisition:**
    *   **Sensors:** Integrate support for multiple biometric sensors (wearables preferred, but webcam-based options for fallback). Minimum supported sensors: Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Skin Conductance (Electrodermal Activity - EDA), Facial Expression Analysis (via webcam).
    *   **Data Transmission:** Secure data transmission protocol (e.g., WebSockets with encryption) for real-time data streaming from user devices to the online system.
    *   **Privacy:** Implement robust user consent mechanisms and data anonymization/pseudonymization techniques to ensure user privacy.

2.  **Real-time Physiological State Inference:**
    *   **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from biometric data streams. Examples:
        *   HRV: RMSSD, SDNN, LF/HF ratio.
        *   EDA: Mean skin conductance level, number of skin conductance responses.
        *   Facial Expressions: Intensity of key expressions (e.g., joy, surprise, attention).
    *   **State Classification:** Utilize machine learning models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks) to classify user physiological states.  Possible states: “Engaged,” “Distracted,” “Neutral,” “Stressed.”  Model trained on labeled biometric data.

3.  **Dynamic Impression Weighting:**
    *   **Impression Score Adjustment:**  Based on inferred physiological state, dynamically adjust the weight assigned to each impression.
        *   If user is “Engaged” (high attention, positive affect): Increase impression weight.
        *   If user is “Distracted” or “Stressed”: Decrease impression weight.
        *   “Neutral” state: Maintain baseline impression weight.
    *   **Weighting Function:** Define a weighting function that maps physiological state to impression weight multiplier. Example:
        *   `WeightMultiplier = 1 + (StateScore * AdjustmentFactor)`
        *   `StateScore`: A numerical representation of the user’s physiological state (e.g., 0 for “Distracted,” 1 for “Neutral,” 2 for “Engaged”).
        *   `AdjustmentFactor`: A tunable parameter to control the sensitivity of the weighting adjustment.
    *   **Integration with Machine Learning Models:** Incorporate weighted impressions into the training data for the reach inference models.  

4.  **Model Retraining and Feedback Loop:**
    *   **Continuous Retraining:** Continuously retrain the reach inference models using the weighted training data.
    *   **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor the performance of the reach inference models (e.g., using A/B testing).
    *   **Adaptive Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust the weighting function and model parameters based on performance monitoring results.

**Pseudocode (Impression Weighting Logic):**

```
function calculate_impression_weight(user_biometric_data):
  state = infer_physiological_state(user_biometric_data)
  if state == "Engaged":
    state_score = 2
  elif state == "Distracted" or state == "Stressed":
    state_score = 0
  else:
    state_score = 1

  adjustment_factor = 0.5 // Tunable parameter
  weight_multiplier = 1 + (state_score * adjustment_factor)
  return weight_multiplier

// In training loop:
for each impression in training_data:
  weight = calculate_impression_weight(user_biometric_data)
  impression.weight = impression.weight * weight
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved reach inference accuracy.
*   More nuanced understanding of user engagement.
*   Potential for personalized content delivery.
*   Better identification of "true" impressions versus "blind" impressions.
