## Dynamic Segment Stitching with Predictive Quality Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the segmented delivery approach detailed in the patent by introducing *predictive* quality mapping and dynamic segment stitching. Instead of simply delivering segments at potentially varying adaptive bitrates, pre-calculate a quality 'heat map' based on content complexity *within* the segment, and dynamically stitch together portions of different encoded versions *within* a single segment delivery to maximize perceived quality.

**Specs:**

*   **Pre-Encoding Phase: Content Complexity Analysis:**
    *   Analyze original media content to identify scenes/segments with high and low motion, detail, and color variation.
    *   Generate a 'complexity score' for each short time window (e.g., 0.5-1 second) within each segment.  Metrics to include:
        *   Motion Vector Sum (MVS)
        *   Spatial Frequency Variance (SFV)
        *   Color Histogram Entropy (CHE)
    *   Store complexity scores associated with each time window in a lookup table.
*   **Multi-Resolution Encoding:**
    *   Encode source content into at least three resolution/bitrate tiers (Low, Medium, High).  More tiers are possible.
    *   For *each* resolution tier, create 'sub-segments' aligned with the time windows defined during complexity analysis.
*   **Real-Time Stitching Engine:**
    *   Receive clientâ€™s current network bandwidth and display capabilities.
    *   For each incoming segment request:
        *   Query the complexity score lookup table for the current segment.
        *   Based on network bandwidth and display capabilities:
            *   Select a 'base' resolution tier for the segment.
            *   For *each* time window within the segment:
                *   If the complexity score is *high*:
                    *   If network bandwidth allows, select the *next higher* resolution sub-segment for that time window.
                *   If the complexity score is *low*:
                    *   If network bandwidth is constrained, select the *next lower* resolution sub-segment for that time window.
                *   Otherwise (moderate complexity), use the base resolution sub-segment.
            *   Stitch the selected sub-segments together to create a dynamically optimized segment.
            *   Deliver the stitched segment to the client.

**Pseudocode (Stitching Engine):**

```
function stitchSegment(segmentRequest, clientBandwidth, clientResolution):
    complexityData = lookupComplexity(segmentRequest.segmentID)
    baseTier = determineBaseTier(clientBandwidth, clientResolution)
    stitchedSegment = []

    for timeWindow in complexityData:
        complexityScore = timeWindow.score
        
        if complexityScore > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
            segmentTier = baseTier + 1
        elif complexityScore < LOW_THRESHOLD:
            segmentTier = baseTier - 1
        else:
            segmentTier = baseTier
        
        subSegment = loadSubSegment(segmentRequest.segmentID, timeWindow.startTime, segmentTier)
        stitchedSegment.append(subSegment)
    
    return stitchedSegment
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ComplexityData`: Array of `TimeWindow` objects.
*   `TimeWindow`:  `startTime`, `score` (float).
*   `SubSegment`: Encoded video data for a specific time window at a specific resolution.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved perceived quality, especially during fast action or detailed scenes.
*   More efficient bandwidth utilization by allocating higher bitrates only where needed.
*   Seamless integration with existing adaptive bitrate streaming infrastructure.
