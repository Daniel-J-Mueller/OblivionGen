## Dynamic Stack Trace Symbolization with User-Space Probes

**Specification:** A system for dynamically enriching stack traces with user-space probes, enabling more detailed and context-aware error reporting *without* requiring application rebuilds or kernel modifications. This builds on the concept of translating numerical stack trace data to human-readable information, but adds a layer of real-time context gathering.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Probe Injection Library:** A lightweight library dynamically linked into the target application at runtime (e.g., via `LD_PRELOAD` or equivalent mechanisms). This library intercepts function calls and, *before* the function executes, registers a user-space probe – essentially a callback function – with a central probe manager.  The probe is associated with the function’s address.
2.  **Probe Manager:** A separate process (or thread) responsible for managing the registered probes. It maintains a map of function addresses to probe functions. The manager also includes a mechanism for asynchronous communication with the application.
3.  **Context Gathering Probes:** Probe functions are designed to gather contextual data *relevant to the function being called*. This could include:
    *   Values of key variables
    *   State of application objects
    *   External system metrics (CPU usage, memory consumption) – accessed through system calls.
4.  **Stack Trace Interception & Enrichment:** When an exception occurs, the standard stack trace collection mechanism (as described in the provided patent) is triggered. *Before* the stack trace is translated, it is intercepted by the Probe Manager.
5.  **Dynamic Context Injection:** For each function address in the stack trace:
    *   The Probe Manager checks if a probe is registered for that address.
    *   If a probe exists, the Probe Manager *asynchronously* requests the probe function to execute and return its collected contextual data.
    *   The collected data is then appended to the human-readable stack trace information, alongside the function name, file, and line number.

**Pseudocode (Probe Manager - Stack Trace Enrichment):**

```
function enrich_stack_trace(raw_stack_trace):
  human_readable_trace = []
  for frame in raw_stack_trace:
    function_address = frame.address
    function_name, file, line = symbol_lookup(function_address) // Existing symbol lookup

    context_data = get_context_data(function_address) // Asynchronously retrieve context

    enriched_frame = {
        "function_name": function_name,
        "file": file,
        "line": line,
        "context": context_data
    }
    human_readable_trace.append(enriched_frame)

  return human_readable_trace
```

**Asynchronous Communication:**

*   Utilize a message queue or shared memory for communication between the Probe Manager and the target application.
*   The Probe Manager sends a request for context data.
*   The application’s probe function executes and writes the context data to the shared resource.
*   The Probe Manager retrieves the data.

**Benefits:**

*   **No Application Rebuilds:** Probes are injected at runtime, eliminating the need to recompile the application for enhanced error reporting.
*   **Dynamic Context:** Contextual data can be gathered on demand, providing real-time insights into the application’s state.
*   **Extensibility:** New probes can be added without modifying the core application.
*   **Reduced Overhead:** Asynchronous communication minimizes the impact on application performance.
