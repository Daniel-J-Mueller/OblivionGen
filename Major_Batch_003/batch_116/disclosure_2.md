## Dynamic Acoustic Mapping for Enhanced Floorplan Reconstruction

**Concept:** Expand upon the audio feature extraction by integrating real-time acoustic mapping alongside the visual data. This allows for floorplan reconstruction even in areas with limited or no visual coverage, and dramatically improves accuracy by providing contextual information about room function and adjacency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** A portable, multi-microphone array (minimum 8 microphones) capable of 360Â° audio capture. The array should be integrated with the video capture device (or function as a separate synchronized unit).  Microphone spacing optimized for frequency range relevant to room acoustics (e.g., reverberation time estimation).
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):**  An IMU integrated with the microphone array/video capture device to track movement and orientation accurately.
*   **Edge Processing Unit:** A low-power, high-performance edge processing unit to perform preliminary audio processing and data synchronization.
*   **Wireless Communication Module:** High-bandwidth wireless communication (e.g., Wi-Fi 6E, 5G) for real-time data transmission to a central server or cloud infrastructure.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Analysis:**
    *   **Reverberation Time (RT60) Estimation:** Algorithms to accurately estimate RT60 for different areas within the captured space.  RT60 is a strong indicator of room size and material composition.
    *   **Sound Source Localization:** Algorithms to identify and localize sound sources (e.g., HVAC systems, running water, human speech).
    *   **Material Classification:** Algorithms to classify dominant materials based on acoustic signatures (e.g., hard surfaces vs. soft furnishings).
    *   **Noise Floor Mapping:**  Establish a baseline noise floor to filter out irrelevant sounds and enhance feature extraction.

*   **Spatial Audio Reconstruction:**
    *   **Beamforming:** Use beamforming techniques to focus audio capture on specific areas and enhance signal-to-noise ratio.
    *   **3D Audio Mapping:** Create a 3D map of the acoustic environment, visualizing sound intensity and source locations.
    *   **Acoustic Ray Tracing:** Simulate the propagation of sound waves within the space to infer room geometry and material properties.

*   **Data Fusion and Floorplan Generation:**
    *   **Sensor Fusion Engine:** Integrate visual and acoustic data streams, synchronizing timestamps and correcting for sensor drift.  Kalman filtering or similar techniques to manage uncertainty.
    *   **Bayesian Network:** A Bayesian network to model the relationships between visual features, acoustic features, and room characteristics (size, shape, function).
    *   **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN):** Utilize a GAN to generate the floorplan, leveraging the Bayesian network output as conditional input.  The GAN is trained on a large dataset of floorplans and corresponding acoustic data.
    *   **Semantic Labeling:** Extend the semantic labeling capabilities to incorporate acoustic cues (e.g., kitchen identified by running water and appliance sounds).

**3. Workflow:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Capture synchronized video and audio data using the integrated device.  The IMU tracks device movement.
2.  **Pre-processing:** Perform initial audio filtering and noise reduction on the edge processing unit.  Synchronize audio and video streams.
3.  **Feature Extraction:** Extract visual features (as in the original patent) and acoustic features (RT60, sound source locations, material classification) on the edge or central server.
4.  **Data Fusion:** Integrate visual and acoustic features using the sensor fusion engine.  The Bayesian network infers room characteristics.
5.  **Floorplan Generation:** The GAN generates the 2D floorplan based on the fused data and Bayesian network output.
6.  **Semantic Labeling:** Assign semantic labels to rooms based on visual and acoustic cues.
7.  **Output:** Generate a 2D floorplan with geometric layout and semantic room labels.

**Pseudocode (Data Fusion):**

```
// Input: visualFeatures, audioFeatures, IMU data
// Output: fusedData

fusedData = {}

// 1. IMU data used to correct for device position/orientation
correctedVisualFeatures = applyIMUCorrection(visualFeatures, IMU data)
correctedAudioFeatures = applyIMUCorrection(audioFeatures, IMU data)

// 2. Bayesian Network Inference
roomCharacteristics = bayesianNetwork.infer(correctedVisualFeatures, correctedAudioFeatures)

// 3. Fuse features
fusedData.geometry = correctedVisualFeatures.geometry + roomCharacteristics.size
fusedData.materials = correctedVisualFeatures.materials + roomCharacteristics.materials
fusedData.semantics = correctedVisualFeatures.semantics + roomCharacteristics.function

return fusedData
```

**Novelty:** The combination of detailed acoustic scene analysis, spatial audio reconstruction, and data fusion with visual data provides a significant advancement in floorplan reconstruction accuracy, particularly in challenging environments or areas with limited visual coverage. This system enables the creation of more complete and accurate floorplans, even from sparse or incomplete data.
