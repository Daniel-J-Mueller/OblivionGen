## Adaptive Resolution & Metric Fusion for Perceptual Streaming

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust video resolution *during* transcoding based on real-time quality metric predictions, aiming to optimize bandwidth usage while maintaining a target perceptual quality level. The system leverages the existing hardware acceleration for quality metrics and extends it to actively *influence* the encoding process.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Extend the existing ASIC to include a feedback loop connecting the quality metric computation unit to the video encoder control signals.
    *   Add a small, dedicated memory buffer to store predicted quality metric values for short-term analysis (e.g., last 5-10 frames).
    *   Implement a "Quality Prediction Unit" (QPU) – a hardware block responsible for forecasting quality metrics based on current and past frame data *before* encoding.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **QPU Training:** A machine learning model (potentially a lightweight convolutional neural network) trained to predict perceptual quality metrics (VMAF, MS-SSIM) based on raw frame data. This model runs *within* the QPU. Model updates are possible via firmware updates.
    *   **Resolution Control Algorithm:**
        1.  For each frame (or group of frames – GOP), the QPU predicts the perceptual quality metric if the frame is encoded at several different resolutions (e.g., 1080p, 720p, 480p).
        2.  The algorithm selects the *lowest* resolution that still meets a predefined target perceptual quality threshold.
        3.  Encoder control signals are adjusted to encode the frame at the selected resolution.
        4.  The *actual* achieved perceptual quality is measured *after* encoding, and this data is fed back to refine the QPU's predictions (online learning).
*   **Pseudocode (Resolution Control Algorithm):**

```
function select_resolution(current_frame, target_quality):
  resolutions = [1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p] // Example resolutions
  predicted_qualities = []

  for resolution in resolutions:
    predicted_quality = QPU.predict_quality(current_frame, resolution)
    predicted_qualities.append(predicted_quality)

  best_resolution_index = 0
  for i in range(len(predicted_qualities)):
    if predicted_qualities[i] >= target_quality:
      best_resolution_index = i
      break

  selected_resolution = resolutions[best_resolution_index]
  encoder.set_resolution(selected_resolution)

  actual_quality = quality_metric_unit.compute_metric(encoded_frame)
  QPU.update_model(actual_quality)

  return selected_resolution
```

*   **Extension:** Implement a “viewport priority” system. If a user is actively viewing a specific region of the video (e.g., due to eye-tracking or mouse movement), prioritize maintaining high resolution in that viewport even if it means reducing resolution elsewhere in the frame.
*   **Metric Fusion Enhancement:** Expand metric computation to include a "perceptual bandwidth cost" which considers the data rate *and* the achieved perceptual quality. This enables optimization for both bandwidth *and* quality.
