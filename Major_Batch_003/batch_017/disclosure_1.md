## Dynamic Audio-Visual Scene Generation

**Core Concept:** Extend the text-based scrubber functionality to not just *access* audio segments, but to dynamically generate corresponding visual scenes. Instead of simply associating pre-existing visuals with audio, the system *creates* visuals based on the audio content *and* the selected text phrase.

**Specs:**

*   **Scene Graph Database:** Maintain a database of visual elements (objects, backgrounds, animations, effects) categorized by semantic tags derived from natural language processing (NLP). This NLP component is crucial and should focus on identifying objects, actions, emotions, and settings within the transcribed audio and associated text phrases.
*   **Phrase-to-Scene Mapping:** When a user selects a phrase via the text-based scrubber, the system performs the following:
    1.  **NLP Analysis:** Analyze the selected phrase to extract semantic tags.
    2.  **Scene Element Selection:**  Query the Scene Graph Database for visual elements matching the extracted tags.  Prioritize elements based on relevance scores (e.g., an action verb like "running" would prioritize animated character running sequences).
    3.  **Scene Composition:**  Dynamically compose a visual scene using the selected elements.  This includes positioning elements, adjusting scale, applying lighting, and triggering animations.  A basic physics engine for interactions should be included (objects can collide, roll, fall).
*   **Scene Style Control:** Provide the user with controls to influence the aesthetic style of the generated scenes:
    *   **Artistic Style:** Select from pre-defined styles (e.g., cartoon, photorealistic, impressionistic, pixel art). These styles define rendering parameters, color palettes, and texture usage.
    *   **Mood/Emotion:** Select a desired mood or emotion (e.g., happy, sad, suspenseful). The system adjusts lighting, color grading, and animation pacing to convey the selected emotion.
    *   **Camera Angle/Movement:** Provide options for selecting camera angles (e.g., wide shot, close-up, bird's-eye view) and movements (e.g., pan, zoom, rotate).
*   **Temporal Coherence:** Implement a smoothing algorithm to ensure visual continuity between consecutive scenes generated by scrubbing through the audio. This prevents jarring transitions and maintains a consistent visual narrative. Use cross-dissolves, object tracking, and scene blending techniques.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to:
    *   Replace automatically selected visual elements with their own assets.
    *   Edit the scene composition (position, scale, rotation of elements).
    *   Add special effects (e.g., particles, lighting effects, transitions).
*   **Export Options:** Provide options to export the generated audio-visual sequence as a video file or a series of images.

**Pseudocode (Scene Generation Module):**

```
function generateScene(phrase, style, mood):
  tags = analyzePhrase(phrase)
  elements = querySceneGraph(tags)
  if elements is empty:
    //Handle cases where no matching elements are found
    //(e.g., fallback to generic visuals or prompt user)
    elements = getDefaultElements()
  scene = new Scene()
  for element in elements:
    //Adjust element properties based on style and mood
    element.applyStyle(style)
    element.applyMood(mood)
    scene.addElement(element)
  return scene
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Automated Video Creation:**  Quickly generate videos from audio recordings, podcasts, or interviews.
*   **Accessibility:** Create visual representations of audio content for visually impaired users.
*   **Creative Storytelling:** Allow users to visually reimagine audio narratives in a personalized way.
*   **Educational Content:** Generate engaging visual aids for audio lessons or lectures.
