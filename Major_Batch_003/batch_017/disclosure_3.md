## Dynamic Haptic Feedback System for Scannable Code Interaction

**Concept:** Augment the scannable code detection system with localized haptic feedback on the mobile device, creating a more intuitive and reliable scanning experience. This goes beyond simply *detecting* a scan, and proactively guides the user towards successful scanning.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Actuator Array:** Integrate a grid of miniaturized haptic actuators (e.g., piezoelectric, linear resonant actuators â€“ LRAs) beneath the screen surface, covering the area where a scannable code is typically displayed. Resolution: Minimum 20 actuators per square inch.
*   **Real-time Code Tracking:** Develop a computer vision module that accurately tracks the scannable code's position and orientation on the screen in real-time.
*   **Predictive Haptic Guidance:** Utilize the computer vision data, combined with sensor data (motion, GPS), to *predict* the scanning beam's path from a presumed scanning device. 
*   **Haptic 'Pull' Effect:** As the scanning beam approaches, activate actuators *adjacent* to the predicted impact point. This creates a subtle "pull" sensation, guiding the scanning beam towards the code. Intensity of the 'pull' scales with proximity.
*   **Scan Confirmation Haptic Pulse:** Upon successful scan detection, deliver a distinct, localized haptic pulse across the entire scannable code area.
*   **Failure/Misalignment Feedback:** If the scan fails or is misaligned, provide a subtly vibrating "shake" to the scannable code area. Pattern differs for misalignment vs. complete failure.
*   **Adaptive Haptic Profiles:** Create multiple haptic profiles to accommodate different scanning device types (laser, camera-based). A profile selection mechanism based on device detection or user preference.
*   **Power Management:** Haptics are energy intensive. Utilize dynamic power allocation, reducing actuator intensity/frequency when scan attempts are infrequent, or when the device is in standby.
*   **Sensor Fusion:** Integrate sensor data (acceleration, gyroscope, magnetometer) to dynamically adjust the haptic feedback based on device orientation and user movement.
*   **API/SDK:**  Provide a public API/SDK allowing third-party applications to integrate the haptic feedback system and customize the experience.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Guidance Logic):**

```
function UpdateHapticFeedback(scannableCodePosition, scanningDevicePosition, sensorData) {

  //Calculate predicted scan path from scanningDevicePosition to scannableCodePosition
  predictedScanPath = CalculatePath(scanningDevicePosition, scannableCodePosition)

  //Calculate distance to predicted impact point
  distance = CalculateDistance(predictedScanPath, scannableCodePosition)

  //Adjust intensity based on distance
  intensity = Map(distance, maxDistance, minDistance, 0, 1)  //Scale 0-1

  //Map to actuator array
  actuatorPattern = GenerateActuatorPattern(scannableCodePosition, intensity)

  //Apply haptic pattern to actuators
  ApplyHapticPattern(actuatorPattern)

  //Check for successful scan detection (from main patent logic)
  if (scanDetected) {
    ApplyScanConfirmationPulse()
    return
  }

  //If scan fails after timeout or misalignment, apply failure feedback
  if (scanFailed || isMisaligned) {
    ApplyFailureFeedback()
  }
}
```
