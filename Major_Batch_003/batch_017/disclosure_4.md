## Dynamic Contextual Emoji Suggestion System

**Concept:** Expand the anchor term disambiguation beyond linking to static topics. Instead, leverage the contextual scoring to *suggest* relevant emojis to the communicating user *during* composition of their status/post. This moves beyond disambiguation to proactive enrichment of communication.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Real-time Text Analysis:** As the user types their communication, the system performs real-time analysis to identify potential "anchor terms" ‚Äì words or phrases with multiple meanings.
2.  **Contextual Scoring Integration:** Utilize the existing contextual scoring mechanism (based on connected users' activity) to determine the *most likely* intended meaning of the anchor term *in the current composition*.  The scoring isn't for post-hoc disambiguation, but for *predictive* assistance.
3.  **Emoji Candidate Generation:**  Map potential meanings (dictionary nodes) to associated emoji. This requires a curated emoji-to-topic mapping database. (e.g., "apple" ‚Äì fruit üçé, company üçè, city üèôÔ∏è). Multiple emojis per meaning are acceptable.
4.  **Dynamic Emoji Suggestion Display:**  A small, non-intrusive display appears near the cursor or below the text input field. This display presents a ranked list of suggested emojis, based on the contextual score of their associated meaning.
5.  **Emoji Insertion:** User clicks or taps on a suggested emoji to insert it into the text field at the cursor location.
6.  **Learning & Personalization:** The system learns from user selections (which emojis they choose when presented with suggestions) and refines the contextual scoring and emoji mapping over time, personalizing the suggestions for each user.
7.  **User Control/Opt-Out:**  Provide a user setting to enable/disable the emoji suggestion feature.
8.  **API Integration:** Expose an API for third-party applications to integrate with the emoji suggestion system.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function analyze_text(text):
  anchor_terms = identify_anchor_terms(text)
  for term in anchor_terms:
    candidate_nodes = get_candidate_nodes(term)
    scores = calculate_contextual_scores(candidate_nodes, user, connected_users)
    ranked_candidates = sort_candidates_by_score(candidate_nodes, scores)
    emoji_suggestions = generate_emoji_suggestions(ranked_candidates)
    display_emoji_suggestions(emoji_suggestions)

function generate_emoji_suggestions(ranked_candidates):
  suggestions = []
  for candidate in ranked_candidates:
    emoji = get_emoji_for_candidate(candidate)
    if emoji:
      suggestions.append(emoji)
  return suggestions

function get_emoji_for_candidate(candidate):
  # Look up emoji mapping in database.  Return null if no mapping exists.
  return database.lookup_emoji(candidate)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Existing social networking system infrastructure.
*   Emoji database with topic mappings.
*   Real-time text analysis engine.
*   Machine learning model for personalization.
*   Client-side application (web/mobile) to display suggestions.
