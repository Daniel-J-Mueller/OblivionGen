## Dynamic Token Bucket Shaping with Predictive Load Adjustment

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting the fixed capacity and refill rate of token buckets used in rate-based load balancing, incorporating predictive modeling of server load and request complexity.

**Core Innovation:** The existing patent centers on a fixed-capacity token bucket. This builds on that by making the bucket *adaptive*. Instead of a static capacity and refill rate, the system predicts incoming request load and adjusts these parameters *before* requests arrive, optimizing for both throughput and latency.

**Components:**

1.  **Load Prediction Module:**  A machine learning model trained on historical request data (request type, size, source, time of day, etc.) and server performance metrics (CPU usage, memory consumption, network bandwidth). This module forecasts the number and complexity of incoming requests for a short time horizon (e.g., the next 5-10 seconds).  Models to explore include time series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet) and regression models.

2.  **Complexity Assessment Module:**  Analyzes incoming requests (or a sample of recent requests) to estimate their computational complexity. This can be a simple heuristic (e.g., request size, number of database queries) or a more sophisticated model trained to predict execution time.

3.  **Adaptive Token Bucket Controller:** This module receives predictions from the Load Prediction Module and Complexity Assessment Module. It then dynamically adjusts the following parameters of the token bucket for each server:

    *   **Bucket Capacity:** Increases capacity during predicted high load to absorb bursts and prevent drops, decreases during low load to enforce stricter rate limiting.
    *   **Refill Rate:** Adjusts the rate at which tokens are added to the bucket, increasing during anticipated load and decreasing during off-peak times.
    *   **Token Size:**  Dynamically adjusts the token size based on the *estimated* complexity of incoming requests. More complex requests require larger tokens.

4.  **Feedback Loop:** Monitors actual server load and performance metrics (latency, error rate) and feeds this data back into the Load Prediction Module and Adaptive Token Bucket Controller to refine predictions and optimize parameter adjustments.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Per-Server Process
while (true) {
  // 1. Predict Load
  predictedLoad = LoadPredictionModule.predict(historicalData);
  predictedComplexity = ComplexityAssessmentModule.assess(recentRequests);

  // 2. Calculate Optimal Bucket Parameters
  bucketCapacity = calculateBucketCapacity(predictedLoad, serverCapacity);
  refillRate = calculateRefillRate(predictedLoad, serverSpeed);
  tokenSize = calculateTokenSize(predictedComplexity);

  // 3. Apply Parameters to Token Bucket
  tokenBucket.setCapacity(bucketCapacity);
  tokenBucket.setRefillRate(refillRate);
  tokenBucket.setTokenSize(tokenSize);

  // 4. Process Incoming Request
  if (tokenBucket.tryConsumeToken()) {
    processRequest(request);
  } else {
    dropRequest(); // Or queue for later processing
  }

  // 5. Monitor & Feedback
  monitorServerLoad();
  feedDataToPredictionModule();
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `TokenBucket`:  Existing data structure with added `tokenSize` parameter.
*   `PredictionData`:  Historical request data and server performance metrics.
*   `ServerProfile`: Configuration parameters for each server (e.g., CPU speed, memory size).

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved throughput and latency by proactively adapting to changing load conditions.
*   Enhanced resource utilization by optimizing rate limiting based on server capacity and request complexity.
*   Increased system resilience by preventing overload during peak traffic.
*   Fine-grained control over request processing based on predicted resource requirements.
