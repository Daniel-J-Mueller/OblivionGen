## Dynamic Interference Mapping with Drone Swarms

**Concept:** Leverage a swarm of small, autonomous drones equipped with sensitive RF receivers to create a real-time, highly granular interference map of the wireless mesh network environment. This map will not just identify aggressor/victim links, but quantify the *dynamic* interference landscape, factoring in environmental changes, moving obstacles, and time-varying signal propagation. This data will feed into a predictive beamforming algorithm, optimizing beam coefficients *before* interference occurs, rather than reacting to it.

**Specifications:**

*   **Drone Hardware:**
    *   Size: < 250g (for regulatory compliance – e.g., FAA Part 107)
    *   Flight Time: 20+ minutes per charge
    *   RF Receiver: Frequency range covering mesh network operating bands (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz, etc.).  Sensitivity: -110 dBm or better. Multiple antennas for direction finding.
    *   Processing Unit: Embedded system capable of real-time signal processing (FFT, spectrogram analysis, RSSI calculation).
    *   Positioning System: GPS + IMU + Visual Odometry (for robust indoor/outdoor positioning).
    *   Communication: Mesh networking capabilities for drone-to-drone and drone-to-controller communication.
    *   Power: Fast-charging battery system with automated docking/charging stations.
*   **Controller Software:**
    *   Swarm Management: Algorithms for autonomous drone deployment, path planning, and collision avoidance.
    *   Data Aggregation: System for receiving RF data from multiple drones in real-time.
    *   Interference Mapping:  Creation of a 3D interference map using drone data, representing signal strength, interference sources, and propagation characteristics.  Map resolution: 10cm – 50cm.
    *   Predictive Beamforming: Machine learning model trained on historical and real-time interference data to predict future interference patterns. This model will output optimized beamforming coefficients for victim nodes.
    *   Integration: API for seamless integration with existing mesh network controllers.
*   **Operation Sequence:**
    1.  **Deployment:** Controller initiates drone swarm deployment. Drones autonomously navigate to designated mapping zones, covering the target area of the mesh network.
    2.  **Data Collection:** Drones actively scan for RF signals, measuring signal strength, frequency, and direction of arrival. Data is transmitted to the controller in real-time.
    3.  **Map Creation:** Controller aggregates drone data to build a high-resolution 3D interference map.
    4.  **Prediction & Optimization:** Predictive beamforming algorithm analyzes the interference map and predicts future interference patterns. It calculates optimized beamforming coefficients for each victim node.
    5.  **Coefficient Application:** Optimized beamforming coefficients are transmitted to the mesh network controllers and applied to the victim nodes.
    6.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Drone swarm continuously monitors the environment, updating the interference map and re-optimizing beamforming coefficients as needed.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Beamforming Algorithm):**

```
function predict_interference(interference_map, historical_data):
    // historical_data contains time series of interference patterns
    // interference_map is the current 3D map of RF signals

    // Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the interference map and historical data
    features = extract_features(interference_map, historical_data) // example: RSSI, Angle of Arrival, Frequency

    // Time Series Prediction: Use a time series model (e.g., LSTM, GRU) to predict future interference patterns
    predicted_interference = time_series_model.predict(features)

    // Optimization: Calculate optimized beamforming coefficients based on predicted interference
    beamforming_coefficients = optimize_beamforming(predicted_interference)

    return beamforming_coefficients
```

**Novelty:** Existing beamforming techniques primarily react to interference. This system *proactively* predicts and mitigates interference by leveraging a dynamic, real-time interference map generated by a drone swarm. This is a shift from reactive to predictive beamforming, significantly enhancing network performance and reliability.
