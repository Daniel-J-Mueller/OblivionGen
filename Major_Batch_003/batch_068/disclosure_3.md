## Dynamic Neural Network Stage Selection via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Adaptively determine the optimal stage within a neural network to insert non-local blocks, not through pre-defined selection, but via a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. This allows the network to learn *where* non-local operations provide the most benefit for a given input.

**Specifications:**

1.  **RL Agent:** Implement a Q-learning or Policy Gradient agent.
    *   **State:** The state will be a vector representing the activations of a selected layer within the baseline neural network *before* the potential insertion of a non-local block. Potentially include statistics like mean, variance, and entropy of these activations.
    *   **Actions:** Each action represents a specific stage of the neural network. The agent chooses *which* stage to insert the non-local block into.
    *   **Reward:** The reward is based on the *change* in performance of the non-local machine-learning model *after* the insertion. Metrics like validation accuracy, loss reduction, or F1-score can be used.  A delayed reward structure is preferable; reward is only assigned after several forward passes through the updated network.
    *   **Exploration Strategy:** Implement an epsilon-greedy or similar exploration strategy to encourage the agent to explore different stages.

2.  **Non-Local Block Insertion Module:** A module responsible for inserting the generated non-local block into the baseline neural network at the selected stage. This module must handle:
    *   Receiving the selected stage index from the RL agent.
    *   Dynamically modifying the baseline network architecture to insert the block.
    *   Ensuring compatibility between the dimensions of the non-local block and the baseline network's layers.

3.  **Training Procedure:**
    *   Initialize the baseline machine-learning model.
    *   For each training epoch:
        *   For each batch of training samples:
            *   Use the RL agent to select a stage for non-local block insertion.
            *   Insert the generated non-local block into the selected stage.
            *   Train the modified network on the batch.
            *   Calculate the reward based on the performance change.
            *   Update the RL agent's policy based on the reward.
            *   Potentially revert the network to its previous state for further exploration (if necessary).

4.  **Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```python
# Initialization
baseline_model = initialize_baseline_model()
rl_agent = initialize_rl_agent(num_stages=num_stages)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
  for batch in data_loader:
    # Select stage via RL
    selected_stage = rl_agent.select_action(baseline_model.get_layer_activations())

    # Generate non-local block
    non_local_block = generate_non_local_block(batch)

    # Insert block
    modified_model = insert_block(baseline_model, non_local_block, selected_stage)

    # Train model
    loss = train_step(modified_model, batch)

    # Calculate reward
    reward = calculate_reward(loss, previous_loss)

    # Update RL agent
    rl_agent.update_policy(reward)

    # Update previous_loss
    previous_loss = loss
```

5. **Layer Activation Capture:** To feed the RL Agent a state, the baseline model must include a means of capturing layer activations. This will most likely be implemented as a forward hook or a custom forward pass.

This dynamic stage selection process aims to move beyond static network configurations, allowing the non-local operations to be deployed *where they are most effective* for a given input distribution, potentially leading to improved performance and generalization.
