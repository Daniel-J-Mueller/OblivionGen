## Dynamic Conversation ‘Temperature’ & Prioritization

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple thread notification suppression by dynamically assessing and visualizing the ‘temperature’ of a conversation – a measure of urgency, emotional intensity, and individual user relevance – and then *proactively* re-prioritizing the display of messages *within* the main conversation flow, not just silencing threads.

**Specs:**

**1. ‘Temperature’ Calculation:**

*   **Input Signals:**
    *   **Keyword Density:** Analyze messages for keywords associated with urgency (e.g., "urgent," "critical," "immediately") or emotional intensity (positive/negative sentiment scoring).
    *   **Sender Importance:** Assign each user a dynamic importance score based on past interactions (frequency, reciprocity, explicitly defined relationships/groups).
    *   **Response Time:** Track the time elapsed since the last message in a thread, weighting shorter times more heavily.
    *   **Media Type:** Factor in the presence of images, videos, or attachments, potentially increasing temperature.
    *   **Explicit Flags:** Allow users to manually flag messages as high/medium/low priority.
*   **Calculation:** Combine these signals into a weighted score (0-100) representing the overall ‘temperature’ of a conversation or thread.  Weights are configurable per user.
*   **Decay Function:**  Implement a decay function to reduce temperature over time.  A conversation that was highly active yesterday should have a lower temperature today unless new messages arrive.

**2. Dynamic Message Re-Prioritization:**

*   **Conversation View:** In the main conversation list, sort conversations/threads based on their calculated temperature.  Highest temperature at the top.
*   **Within-Thread Sorting:** *Within* a thread, sort messages based on temperature (highest first) *and* chronological order.  High-temperature messages appear first, even if they are older.  Chronological order resolves ties.
*   **Visual Indicators:**
    *   **Heatmap Overlay:**  Subtly color-code messages in the thread based on their temperature. (e.g., Cool Blue = Low, Yellow = Medium, Red = High).
    *   **Priority Banners:** Display a small banner/icon on high-temperature messages, making them visually distinct.
    *   **Dynamic Thread Folding:**  Automatically 'fold' or collapse low-temperature threads to reduce clutter.

**3.  Personalized Temperature Profiles:**

*   **User Calibration:** Allow users to calibrate the temperature system by adjusting weights for different input signals.  (e.g., “I want keywords to be more important than sender importance”).
*   **Contextual Temperature:** Allow the system to adjust temperature based on context (e.g., automatically increase temperature for messages received during work hours).
*   **‘Do Not Disturb’ Override:** Allow users to globally override the temperature system and display all messages in strict chronological order.

**4.  Pseudocode (Core Temperature Calculation):**

```
function calculate_temperature(message, sender, context) {
    keyword_score = analyze_keywords(message);
    sender_score = get_sender_importance(sender);
    response_time_score = calculate_response_time_score(message);
    media_score = calculate_media_score(message);
    explicit_flag_score = get_explicit_flag_score(message);

    temperature = (
        (keyword_score * weight_keyword) +
        (sender_score * weight_sender) +
        (response_time_score * weight_response_time) +
        (media_score * weight_media) +
        (explicit_flag_score * weight_explicit_flag)
    );

    // Apply decay function (e.g., exponential decay)
    temperature = temperature * decay_factor;

    return temperature;
}
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Performance:  Temperature calculation and message sorting must be efficient to avoid impacting user experience.  Consider caching and background processing.
*   Scalability:  The system must be able to handle a large number of users and conversations.
*   Privacy:  Ensure that user preferences and data are handled securely.
*   AI Integration:  Explore using machine learning to automatically adjust weights and improve temperature accuracy.
