## Dynamic Content Stitching for Hyperlocal Event Experiences

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** "Event Fabric" - A real-time content aggregation and stitching engine.
*   **Input Streams:**
    *   Live Broadcast Feeds (as in the provided patent).
    *   User-Generated Short-Form Video (TikTok/Reels style).
    *   Social Media Feeds (X/Twitter, Instagram, Facebook – filtered by geo & event tags).
    *   On-Site Sensor Data (Crowd density, noise levels, weather).
    *   Event Organizer Supplied Assets (Pre-recorded segments, graphics, announcements).
*   **Output:** Dynamic, personalized "Event Streams" for individual users.
*   **Hardware:** Cloud-based infrastructure. High bandwidth, low latency connectivity essential. Edge computing nodes for sensor data processing and localized content delivery.

**Innovation Detail:**

This builds *on* the idea of surfacing content from broadcasters at an event, but moves beyond simply presenting a list of streams. The core idea is to *actively construct* a personalized viewing experience by stitching together segments from multiple sources in real-time.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Event Definition:** Event organizer defines event details (location, time, tags).
2.  **Broadcaster/User Registration:** Broadcasters (as per the patent) & general users register for the event.
3.  **Content Ingestion:** All input streams are ingested into the Event Fabric.
4.  **AI-Driven Segmentation:** AI algorithms analyze all incoming content, identifying “interesting moments” (e.g., goals scored, musical peaks, key speakers).  These segments are tagged with metadata (content type, emotion, key entities).
5.  **Personalized Stitching:**  Based on user preferences (explicitly set or inferred from viewing history), Event Fabric stitches together segments from different streams, creating a unique Event Stream for each user.
6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors user engagement (view time, likes, shares) and dynamically adjusts the Event Stream in real-time to maximize engagement.
7.  **AR/VR Integration (Optional):** Event Streams can be delivered to AR/VR headsets for immersive experiences.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Stitching Algorithm):**

```
function stitch_event_stream(user_profile, available_segments):
  user_preferences = extract_preferences(user_profile)
  filtered_segments = filter_segments(available_segments, user_preferences)
  sorted_segments = sort_segments(filtered_segments, engagement_score)

  event_stream = []
  current_time = event_start_time

  for segment in sorted_segments:
    if segment.start_time >= current_time:
      event_stream.append(segment)
      current_time = segment.end_time

  return event_stream
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Live Sports:**  Combine broadcaster feed with fan-captured footage, instant replays, social media reactions, and athlete interviews.
*   **Music Festivals:** Stitch together stage performances with backstage access, crowd reactions, and artist interviews.
*   **Conferences:** Combine keynote speeches with Q&A sessions, panel discussions, and networking events.
*   **Local Events:** Combine broadcaster feeds with local business promotions, community announcements, and user-generated content.
