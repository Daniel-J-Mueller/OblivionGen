## Adaptive Tag Weighting for Multi-Channel Messaging

**Concept:** Extend the tagging system to dynamically adjust tag importance based on message channel and recipient behavior, creating a personalized filtering experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Tag Weighting Engine (TWE) - a module integrated into the existing messaging system.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Message Tag(s) – as defined in the base patent.
    *   Channel Identifier – identifies the messaging channel (e.g., email, SMS, in-app notification, push notification).
    *   Recipient Profile – stores recipient interaction history (opens, clicks, responses, blocks, reports) per tag.
    *   Global Weighting Table – admin-configurable weights for tags across all channels (initial values).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Base Weight Retrieval:**  For each tag in a message, retrieve the global weight from the Global Weighting Table.
    2.  **Channel Modifier:** Apply a channel-specific modifier to the base weight. Modifiers are configurable per channel and tag combination.
    3.  **Recipient Behavioral Adjustment:** Analyze the recipient's interaction history for the specific tag.
        *   Positive Interactions (opens, clicks): Increase the tag weight.
        *   Negative Interactions (blocks, reports, ignores): Decrease the tag weight.
        *   Neutral Interactions (no action): Maintain weight.
        *   Weight adjustments are applied using a decaying factor to account for recency of interaction.
    4.  **Weighted Filtering:** The filtering policy now uses the dynamically adjusted tag weight to determine message priority and blocking. Higher weights increase the likelihood of message delivery; lower weights increase the likelihood of filtering.
*   **Data Outputs:**
    *   Adjusted Tag Weight – output used by the filtering policy.
    *   Recipient Profile Updates – continuous updates to the recipient’s interaction history.
    *   Weight Adjustment Logs – for auditing and analysis.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateAdjustedTagWeight(messageTag, channelID, recipientProfile)

    // Retrieve base weight from global table
    baseWeight = GetBaseWeight(messageTag)

    // Apply channel modifier
    channelModifier = GetChannelModifier(messageTag, channelID)
    weightedWeight = baseWeight * channelModifier

    // Apply recipient behavioral adjustment
    positiveInteractions = GetPositiveInteractions(recipientProfile, messageTag)
    negativeInteractions = GetNegativeInteractions(recipientProfile, messageTag)

    // Apply weighting factor for positive/negative interactions
    positiveWeightingFactor = 0.1  // Example value
    negativeWeightingFactor = 0.2  // Example value

    behavioralAdjustment = (positiveInteractions * positiveWeightingFactor) - (negativeInteractions * negativeWeightingFactor)

    adjustedWeight = weightedWeight + behavioralAdjustment

    // Ensure weight stays within reasonable bounds (e.g., 0-1)
    adjustedWeight = Clamp(adjustedWeight, 0, 1)

    RETURN adjustedWeight

END FUNCTION
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Scalability – the system must handle a large number of tags, channels, and recipients.
*   Real-time Processing – tag weighting adjustments must happen in real-time to respond to recipient behavior.
*   Privacy – ensure recipient interaction data is anonymized and protected.
*   A/B Testing – allow for A/B testing of different weighting algorithms and parameters.
