## Adaptive Persona Layer

**Concept:** Extend the "secret account" functionality into a dynamic, multi-layered persona system, allowing users to present different facets of themselves to distinct groups, and automatically adjusting presentation based on context.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Creation:**
    *   Users can create multiple "personas" linked to a single core account.
    *   Each persona has configurable settings:
        *   Name & Profile Information (different from core account).
        *   Content Visibility Rules – which groups see what content.
        *   Interaction Filters – controls who can message/interact directly.
        *   Content Style – automated modifications to posts (tone, emoji usage, etc.) to match the persona.
        *   Activity Masking – selectively hide certain activities from specific groups (e.g., hiding likes on political posts from family).
*   **Group Definition:**
    *   Users can define groups beyond simple friend lists. Groups can be based on:
        *   Explicit membership (manually added).
        *   Shared interests (algorithmically determined).
        *   Relationship type (family, colleagues, casual acquaintances).
        *   Location.
*   **Contextual Activation:**
    *   The system automatically switches between personas based on context.
    *   Contextual factors:
        *   Target audience (who is viewing the content).
        *   Platform (e.g., different persona for professional network vs. casual social media).
        *   Content type (e.g., different persona for sharing personal photos vs. professional articles).
        *   Time of day.
        *   User-defined rules.
*   **Persona Blending:**
    *   Allow users to blend aspects of multiple personas to create nuanced presentations. E.g., a "Work-Casual" persona combining professional settings with more relaxed content.
*   **Dynamic Persona Generation:**
    *   Algorithmically generate temporary personas based on a desired presentation goal. E.g., “Generate a persona for attracting potential investors in my startup.” The system creates a persona with appropriate profile info, content style, and interaction settings.

**Pseudocode – Contextual Persona Activation:**

```
function activate_persona(user, content, target_audience) {
  // 1. Retrieve user's defined personas
  personas = get_user_personas(user);

  // 2. Determine context based on target_audience and content_type
  context = analyze_context(target_audience, content.type);

  // 3. Select the best persona based on context and user preferences
  best_persona = select_persona(personas, context, user.preferences);

  // 4. Apply persona settings to content
  modified_content = apply_persona_settings(content, best_persona);

  // 5. Present modified content to target_audience
  present_content(modified_content, target_audience);
}
```

**Potential Implementation Details:**

*   User interface should allow easy persona creation, editing, and management.
*   Privacy controls must be robust to prevent unintended information leaks.
*   Algorithm for persona selection should be customizable and allow user override.
*   Integration with existing social networking features (e.g., groups, messaging).
*   A/B testing to optimize persona settings for different contexts.
*   The capability to 'snapshot' and save persona settings.
