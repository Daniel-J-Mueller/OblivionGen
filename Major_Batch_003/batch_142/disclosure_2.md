## Dynamic Token Bucket Sizing & Inter-Bucket Communication

**Specification:** Implement a system for dynamically adjusting the capacity of token buckets based on observed server load *and* enabling communication between these buckets across a load-balancing cluster.

**Core Concept:**  The fixed-capacity token bucket, while effective, inherently limits scalability.  If a server consistently receives more requests than its bucket allows, requests are dropped, impacting user experience. This design moves beyond fixed capacity and allows buckets to ‘borrow’ or ‘lend’ tokens to each other.

**Components:**

*   **Load Monitoring Agent (LMA):** Resides on each server. Continuously monitors CPU usage, memory utilization, network I/O, and request processing time. Reports metrics to a central **Bucket Management Service (BMS)**.
*   **Bucket Management Service (BMS):**  Centralized service responsible for dynamic bucket sizing and inter-bucket communication.  Receives metrics from LMAs, applies a sizing algorithm, and manages token transfer.
*   **Distributed Token Store (DTS):**  A distributed key-value store (e.g., Redis cluster, Cassandra) used to hold the token counts for each bucket. Facilitates atomic operations for token addition and removal.
*   **Adaptive Sizing Algorithm:** This is the core intelligence.  Example algorithm (pseudocode):

    ```
    function calculate_bucket_size(server_metrics, current_bucket_size):
        predicted_load = extrapolate_load(server_metrics) // Use historical data & current metrics
        if predicted_load > current_bucket_size * threshold_high:
            new_size = current_bucket_size * growth_factor
        elif predicted_load < current_bucket_size * threshold_low:
            new_size = current_bucket_size * shrink_factor
        else:
            new_size = current_bucket_size
        return clamp(new_size, min_bucket_size, max_bucket_size)
    ```
*   **Token Transfer Protocol (TTP):** Defines rules for token exchange between buckets.  Prioritize transfers to buckets experiencing near-capacity conditions.  Example:  If Bucket A is nearing full capacity and Bucket B has significant free tokens, automatically transfer a specified number of tokens from B to A.  Implement a 'fairness' mechanism to prevent a single bucket from consistently dominating token availability.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initialization:** Each server is assigned a token bucket with an initial capacity.
2.  **Monitoring:** LMAs continuously collect server metrics and report them to the BMS.
3.  **Bucket Sizing:** The BMS uses the adaptive sizing algorithm to calculate optimal bucket sizes based on received metrics.  Updates are applied to the DTS.
4.  **Request Handling:**  When a request arrives:
    *   Check if the originating bucket has a token available.
    *   If a token is available, decrement the token count and process the request.
    *   If no token is available, *and* inter-bucket transfer is allowed:
        *   Attempt to borrow a token from a neighboring bucket via TTP.
        *   If a token is successfully borrowed, decrement the count and process the request.
        *   If no token can be borrowed, reject the request (or queue it for later processing).
5.  **Token Refill:** Tokens are refilled at a fixed rate, as in the original design.
6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The BMS continuously monitors server load and adjusts bucket sizes and token transfer rules accordingly.



**Scalability & Resilience:**

*   The distributed token store (DTS) ensures high availability and scalability.
*   The BMS can be horizontally scaled to handle a large number of servers.
*   Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures during token transfer.
*   Allow for manual override of bucket sizes and transfer rules for fine-grained control.



**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Predictive Scaling:** Use machine learning to predict future server load and proactively adjust bucket sizes.
*   **Regional Awareness:** Consider geographic location of servers when determining token transfer priorities.
*   **Weighted Token Transfer:** Assign different weights to tokens based on request priority or service level agreements (SLAs).
