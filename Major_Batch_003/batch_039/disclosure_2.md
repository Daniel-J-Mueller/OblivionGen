## Autonomous Device Discovery & Provisioning via Sonic Tagging

**System Overview:**

A system allowing for device discovery and automated provisioning utilizing inaudible sonic beacons emitted by unprovisioned devices, combined with mobile device acoustic analysis and cloud-based orchestration. This diverges from tag-based systems relying on visual scanning, or purely WiFi-based discovery.

**Components:**

*   **Sonic Beacon Emitter (integrated into unprovisioned devices):** A low-power transducer capable of emitting a unique, digitally encoded ultrasonic signal (e.g., 18-20kHz). The encoding includes:
    *   Device Type ID
    *   Manufacturer ID
    *   Initial Encryption Key (derived from hardware fingerprint)
    *   Temporary Provisioning Identifier
*   **Mobile Application (on user’s smartphone/tablet):**
    *   **Acoustic Listener:** Continuously monitors ambient sound for ultrasonic beacons.
    *   **Signal Processor:**  Filters noise, demodulates the ultrasonic signal, and decodes the embedded data.
    *   **Secure Communication Module:** Establishes a secure connection with a cloud-based Provisioning Server.
    *   **User Interface:**  Displays discovered devices, prompts for confirmation, and handles user interaction.
*   **Provisioning Server (Cloud-based):**
    *   **Device Database:** Stores device information, manufacturer details, security keys, and configuration profiles.
    *   **Authentication Module:** Verifies device identity and user credentials.
    *   **Configuration Manager:**  Generates and distributes device configuration parameters.
    *   **Key Management System:** Securely manages encryption keys.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Beacon Emission:** Unprovisioned device periodically emits its unique ultrasonic beacon.
2.  **Acoustic Detection:** Mobile app detects the beacon via the smartphone’s microphone.
3.  **Data Decoding:** The app decodes the device type, manufacturer, and initial encryption key.
4.  **Secure Communication:** App establishes a secure connection with the Provisioning Server, transmitting the decoded information.
5.  **Device Verification:** Provisioning Server verifies the device's legitimacy and retrieves associated configuration profiles.
6.  **Configuration Generation:** Server generates device-specific configurations and credentials.
7.  **Credential Transmission:** Server securely transmits encrypted configuration data to the mobile app.
8.  **Localized Delivery:**  Mobile app uses localized wireless communication (Bluetooth Low Energy, WiFi Direct) to securely deliver the configuration to the device.
9.  **Device Activation:** Device decrypts the configuration, applies settings, and activates network connectivity.

**Pseudocode (Mobile App - Acoustic Listener):**

```
LOOP:
    audio_data = capture_audio()
    filtered_data = apply_bandpass_filter(audio_data, 18000, 20000) // Focus on ultrasonic range
    signal_strength = calculate_signal_strength(filtered_data)

    IF signal_strength > threshold:
        demodulated_signal = demodulate_signal(filtered_signal)
        decoded_data = decode_data(demodulated_signal) // Extract device ID, manufacturer, key
        // Send decoded data to Provisioning Server
        send_to_server(decoded_data)
    ENDIF
ENDLOOP
```

**Innovation & Differentiation:**

*   **Hands-free Provisioning:** Eliminates the need for manual scanning of QR codes or visual tags.
*   **Increased Security:** Initial encryption key derived from hardware fingerprint adds a layer of security.
*   **Improved Accessibility:**  Benefits users with visual impairments.
*   **Extended Range:** Ultrasonic signals can propagate further than visual tags in certain environments.
*   **Hidden Operation:** The beacon is inaudible to humans, reducing potential for tampering or social engineering.
