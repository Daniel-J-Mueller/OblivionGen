## Dynamic Content Stitching via Predictive Scan Request

**Concept:** Instead of pre-calculating and storing multiple scan versions, dynamically assemble content on-the-fly based on predicted client viewport and bandwidth. This aims to reduce storage overhead and tailor content delivery to individual client needs in real-time.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Content Source:** Original high-resolution content.
*   **Stitching Server:** Core component responsible for content assembly.
*   **Client Device:** Receiving and rendering content.
*   **Prediction Engine:** Machine learning model residing within the Stitching Server.

**2. Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input Features:**
    *   Client Device Capabilities (Screen Resolution, Bandwidth, CPU/GPU Performance) – Regularly updated.
    *   Content Metadata (Resolution, Complexity, Encoding Type).
    *   Client Viewport (Current visible region, scrolling velocity, zoom level) – Real-time updates.
    *   Historical Client Behavior (Preferred Quality Levels, Common Viewport Regions).
*   **Output:**
    *   *Scan Request Map*: A prioritized list of scan regions (tiles) with associated quality levels.  This is *not* a static map, but continuously updated.
    *   *Quality Factor*: A real-time adjustment to overall quality, influenced by bandwidth and device capabilities.

**3. Stitching Server Logic:**

1.  **Receive Request:** Client requests content.
2.  **Profile Client:** Determine client capabilities via initial handshake and subsequent monitoring.
3.  **Predict Scan Requirements:** Prediction Engine generates Scan Request Map and Quality Factor.
4.  **Dynamic Scan Generation:**  Generate only the requested scan regions at the predicted quality level.  Utilize efficient tiling and encoding techniques (e.g., JPEG 2000, WebP).
5.  **Content Assembly:** Stitch together the generated scan regions.
6.  **Transmission:** Transmit the assembled content to the client.
7.  **Real-time Adaptation:** Continuously monitor client viewport, bandwidth, and performance.  Adjust Scan Request Map and Quality Factor accordingly.  Request new scan regions or adjust existing ones as needed.

**4. Client-Side Logic:**

1.  **Initial Request:** Request content.
2.  **Capability Reporting:** Report device capabilities to the Stitching Server.
3.  **Viewport Tracking:** Track client viewport (visible region, scrolling velocity, zoom level) and transmit updates to the Stitching Server.
4.  **Content Rendering:** Render received scan regions seamlessly.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** Provide performance metrics (rendering time, bandwidth usage) to the Stitching Server to improve prediction accuracy.

**5. Pseudocode (Stitching Server):**

```
function processContentRequest(clientID, contentID):
    clientProfile = getClientProfile(clientID)
    contentMetadata = getContentMetadata(contentID)

    while (requestActive):
        scanRequestMap = predictScanRequestMap(clientProfile, contentMetadata)
        scanRegions = generateScanRegions(scanRequestMap)
        assembledContent = stitchScanRegions(scanRegions)
        transmitContent(clientID, assembledContent)

        clientViewportUpdate = receiveClientViewportUpdate(clientID)
        updateClientProfile(clientID, clientViewportUpdate)
```

**6.  Novelty Points:**

*   *On-Demand Scan Generation:*  Moves away from pre-calculated scan versions, reducing storage requirements significantly.
*   *Predictive Scan Requests:*  Proactively requests scan regions based on predicted viewport, optimizing bandwidth usage.
*   *Real-Time Adaptation:* Continuously adjusts content delivery based on client conditions.
*   *Dynamic Quality Adjustment*: Adapts content quality based on client and network conditions.
