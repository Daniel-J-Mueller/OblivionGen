**Adaptive Emotional Resonance Tagging & Playback**

**Concept:** Extend the existing timeline navigation system to incorporate real-time emotional analysis of video content *and* user biometric data (heart rate, facial expressions) to dynamically adjust playback speed, filter content, and generate personalized highlight reels.

**Specs:**

1.  **Emotional Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Video stream.
    *   Process: Employ a trained AI model (facial expression recognition, audio sentiment analysis, scene understanding) to generate an "Emotional Profile" for each video segment (e.g., 0-5 seconds). The profile will include values for joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, neutrality, and valence (positive/negative). Output format: JSON array of emotional scores per segment.
    *   Output: Emotional Profile data.

2.  **Biometric Data Acquisition:**
    *   Input: User biometric data stream (via wearable devices or camera-based sensors). Supported data types: heart rate, facial expressions (via camera), galvanic skin response.
    *   Process: Real-time data processing to establish a baseline and detect emotional fluctuations.
    *   Output: User Emotional State data (e.g., high arousal/positive valence, low arousal/negative valence).

3.  **Adaptive Playback Engine:**
    *   Input: Video stream, Emotional Profile data, User Emotional State data.
    *   Process:
        *   **Relevance Adjustment:** Scale video segment relevance scores based on emotional alignment between video content and user state. E.g., if a user is feeling anxious, downplay segments containing anger or fear.
        *   **Playback Speed Modulation:** Dynamically adjust playback speed based on emotional intensity.  Increase speed during low-intensity segments, slow down during high-intensity moments.
        *   **Content Filtering:** Optionally filter out segments that trigger negative emotional responses in the user.
        *   **Highlight Reel Generation:** Automatically generate personalized highlight reels based on segments that elicit the strongest positive emotional responses from the user.
    *   Output: Modified video stream and/or personalized highlight reel.

4.  **Timeline Integration:**
    *   Modify the existing visual menu timeline to display “Emotional Heatmaps” overlaid on the video segments.
    *   Color-code segments based on dominant emotional tone (e.g., red = anger, blue = sadness, green = joy).
    *   Allow users to filter the timeline based on specific emotions.
    *   Implement “Emotional Skipping” – automatically skip segments that match undesirable emotional profiles.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Playback Engine):**

```
function adaptPlayback(videoSegment, emotionalProfile, userEmotionalState):
  relevanceScore = emotionalProfile.valence * userEmotionalState.valence  // Example: Align valence
  
  if relevanceScore > threshold:
    playbackSpeed = baseSpeed + (emotionalProfile.intensity * speedFactor)
  else:
    playbackSpeed = baseSpeed * 0.5 // Slow down unaligned content
    
  return playbackSpeed
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Sufficient processing power to handle real-time video analysis and biometric data processing.
*   Compatibility with various wearable sensors and cameras.

**Software Requirements:**

*   AI models for emotional analysis (pre-trained or custom-trained).
*   Biometric data processing libraries.
*   Integration with existing video playback framework.
