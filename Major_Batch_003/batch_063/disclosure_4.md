## Dynamic Memory Weaving

**Concept:** Extend the “memory” feature beyond simple snapshots of media and messages. Instead, create a dynamic, AI-woven tapestry of interconnected memories, leveraging contextual awareness and predictive modeling.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Data Structure: "Memory Weave"**

*   A graph database structure. Nodes represent individual "Memory Fragments" (media, messages, timestamps, location data, user reactions, contextual data - see below).
*   Edges represent relationships between Memory Fragments – not just linear chronological order, but semantic connections (e.g., "response to", "similar content", "shared location", “emotional resonance”).
*   Each edge has a ‘weight’ representing the strength/relevance of the connection (determined by AI - see section 3).

**2. Memory Fragment Enhancement – Contextual Data:**

*   **Environmental Capture:** At time of memory fragment creation, passively capture environmental data (ambient sound levels, light levels, nearby Bluetooth/WiFi devices - anonymized/opt-in).
*   **Emotional Analysis:** Employ sentiment analysis on text messages and potentially audio/video content to assess emotional tone.  Store emotional score alongside the fragment.
*   **Activity Recognition:** Use device sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope) to infer user activity (e.g., walking, driving, attending a concert).  Associate activity with fragment.
*   **Topic Modeling:**  Run topic modeling on message content to identify key themes or subjects discussed.

**3. AI-Powered Weaving Engine:**

*   **Connection Discovery:**  An AI model (trained on vast datasets of human communication and contextual data) analyzes new Memory Fragments and attempts to discover connections to existing fragments in the Memory Weave. 
    *   Algorithm prioritizes connections based on similarity of content, emotional resonance, shared context, and temporal proximity.
*   **Predictive Linking:**  AI model predicts *potential* connections.  Example: If a user frequently discusses a specific topic with a particular person, the system may proactively suggest linking new fragments involving those individuals/topics.
*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** Connection weights are not static. They are continuously adjusted based on user interaction (e.g., user frequently views two linked fragments together – weight increases).
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Identifies unexpected or unusual connections that may be worthy of user attention.  (e.g., suddenly linking a fragment from a work chat to a personal photo album).

**4. User Interface/Interaction:**

*   **"Weave View":** A visual interface that allows users to explore their Memory Weave.  Fragments are displayed as nodes, connections as lines.
*   **Filtering/Sorting:**  Users can filter fragments by date, person, location, topic, emotional tone, activity, etc.
*   **"Storyline Generation":** AI can automatically generate narrative "storylines" by traversing the Memory Weave, selecting relevant fragments and presenting them in a coherent sequence.
*   **"Remixing":**  Users can manually re-arrange fragments, create new connections, and customize storylines.
*   **"Time Warp":**  An interactive feature that allows users to navigate the Memory Weave in a non-linear fashion, exploring different time periods and connections simultaneously.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic - Connection Discovery):**

```
function discoverConnections(newFragment, existingWeave):
  // 1. Feature Extraction:  Extract features from newFragment (text, image, metadata, context)
  features = extractFeatures(newFragment)

  // 2. Similarity Search:  Find existing fragments in existingWeave with similar features
  similarFragments = findSimilarFragments(features, existingWeave)

  // 3. Contextual Analysis:  Assess contextual relevance of similarFragments
  relevantFragments = assessContext(newFragment, similarFragments)

  // 4. Connection Weighting:  Calculate connection weight based on similarity, context, and user history
  weights = calculateWeights(newFragment, relevantFragments)

  // 5. Establish Connections:  Add connections to existingWeave with calculated weights
  addConnections(existingWeave, relevantFragments, weights)

  return existingWeave
```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   Cross-device integration – weave memories across all user devices.
*   Shared Weaves – allow users to collaboratively create and explore Memory Weaves with others (with granular privacy controls).
*   “Memory Seeds” – allow users to define initial topics or themes to guide the weaving process.
*   Integration with AR/VR environments – immersive exploration of Memory Weaves in 3D space.
