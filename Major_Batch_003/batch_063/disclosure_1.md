## Dynamic Kernel Composition for Spatio-Temporal Data

**Concept:** Leverage the register-based architecture described in the patent to dynamically compose convolution kernels *during* processing, rather than relying on pre-defined weights. This enables adaptive filtering tailored to the *content* of the input data, especially for spatio-temporal sequences.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Kernel Composition Registers:** Extend the existing ‘second group of registers’ (weight storage) to include a ‘Kernel Building Block’ (KBB) register set. Each KBB register holds a small, programmable filter element (e.g., a 3x3 Sobel operator, a Laplacian, a simple averaging filter, or even a trainable micro-kernel). The number of KBB registers is a design parameter.
2.  **Kernel Assembly Unit (KAU):** A new hardware unit, the KAU, receives control signals indicating which KBB registers to activate and how to combine their outputs to form the final convolution kernel for a given channel. This ‘assembly recipe’ is determined by a control processor based on input data characteristics.
3.  **Data Dependency Analysis:** An integral component is a data dependency analysis module.  This module processes input data *before* the convolution step to identify features or patterns that trigger specific KAU assembly recipes. Examples: edge detection, motion estimation, or texture analysis.  The output of this analysis directly controls the KAU.
4.  **Dynamic Recipe Storage:** A small, fast-access memory stores a library of KAU assembly recipes, indexed by data characteristics identified by the data dependency analysis. This allows for quick retrieval of optimal kernel configurations.
5.  **Register Allocation Strategy:** The first group of registers will store portions of the convolution data matrix as before. The KAU will manage the mapping between active KBB registers and the relevant data in the first register group. Data from these registers will be used as inputs to the KBBs.
6.  **Spatiotemporal Processing:** The system extends to 3D data. Data dependency analysis can be extended to include temporal information (e.g., detecting motion vectors across frames). KAU recipes will be updated dynamically based on the current frame and past frame data, adapting the convolution kernels to changes in the input.
7.  **Micro-Kernel Training:** Incorporate an on-chip learning mechanism. The micro-kernels (contents of the KBB registers) can be updated using a gradient descent algorithm during runtime, adapting to the specific task at hand. This requires a small amount of additional circuitry for accumulating gradients and updating weights.

**Pseudocode (KAU operation):**

```
function assemble_kernel(data_characteristics):
  recipe_index = lookup_recipe(data_characteristics)
  recipe = get_recipe(recipe_index)

  kernel = 0  // Initialize kernel

  for each component in recipe:
    kbb_index = component.kbb_index
    weight = component.weight
    kbb_output = get_kbb_output(kbb_index) // apply to input data
    kernel = kernel + (weight * kbb_output)

  return kernel
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Input data is received and processed by the Data Dependency Analysis module.
2.  The Data Dependency Analysis module determines the appropriate KAU recipe.
3.  The KAU retrieves the recipe and activates the corresponding KBB registers.
4.  Data from the first register group is fed into the activated KBB registers.
5.  The KBB registers perform their respective filtering operations.
6.  The KAU combines the outputs of the KBB registers according to the recipe.
7.  The resulting convolution kernel is applied to the input data.
8.  The output of the convolution is passed to the next processing stage.
