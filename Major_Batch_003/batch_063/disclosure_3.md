**Dynamic Lead Qualification via Behavioral Biometrics**

**Concept:** Enhance lead quality scoring beyond simple interaction with lead generation content. Integrate behavioral biometrics gathered *during* interaction to predict conversion likelihood with greater accuracy.

**Specs:**

1.  **Biometric Data Collection Module:**
    *   Data Points: Mouse movements (speed, acceleration, trajectory), keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure - if available via device), scrolling behavior, touch gestures (if applicable), and time spent on specific content sections.
    *   Collection Frequency: Collect data continuously *during* the user’s interaction with lead generation content. Sample rate: 10-20 Hz.
    *   Data Transmission: Encrypt and transmit collected data to a secure server for processing. Local processing (edge computing) for initial filtering and anomaly detection is optional.

2.  **Behavioral Profile Creation:**
    *   Machine Learning Model: Train a recurrent neural network (RNN) – LSTM or GRU – to establish baseline behavioral profiles for different user segments. Input: Raw biometric data. Output: Feature vectors representing user behavior.
    *   Segmentation: Segment users based on demographic data, industry, job title, and initial interactions. This creates more refined behavioral baselines.
    *   Dynamic Adjustment: Continuously update behavioral profiles based on ongoing user interactions. This ensures adaptability and accuracy.

3.  **Lead Scoring Algorithm:**
    *   Anomaly Detection: Identify deviations from established behavioral baselines. Significant deviations indicate high engagement or potential fraud.
    *   Engagement Metrics: Calculate engagement metrics based on biometric data:
        *   Hesitation Score: Time spent pausing over key elements (CTAs, pricing).
        *   Exploration Score:  Ratio of content explored to content available.
        *   Confidence Score:  Speed and fluidity of mouse movements/keystrokes.
    *   Weighted Scoring: Assign weights to different biometric factors based on their predictive power (determined through A/B testing and historical data). Combine weighted scores to generate an overall lead quality score.

4.  **Integration with Online System:**
    *   API Integration: Expose a REST API to allow the online system to retrieve lead quality scores in real-time.
    *   Real-time Alerting: Trigger alerts for leads with exceptionally high or low scores.
    *   Automated Workflow:  Automatically route high-quality leads to sales representatives and low-quality leads to nurture campaigns.
    *   Feedback Loop: Integrate a feedback mechanism to allow sales representatives to provide feedback on lead quality. This data is used to refine the machine learning model.

**Pseudocode (Lead Scoring):**

```
function calculate_lead_score(user_id, biometric_data):
  user_profile = get_user_profile(user_id)
  expected_behavior = get_expected_behavior(user_profile)
  deviation_score = calculate_deviation(biometric_data, expected_behavior)
  hesitation_score = calculate_hesitation(biometric_data)
  exploration_score = calculate_exploration(biometric_data)

  lead_score = (0.4 * deviation_score) + (0.3 * hesitation_score) + (0.3 * exploration_score)

  return lead_score
```

**Novelty:** Existing lead scoring typically relies on demographic data and explicit interactions. This system incorporates *implicit* behavioral data to create a more nuanced and accurate assessment of lead quality. It moves beyond “what” a user does to “how” they do it.
