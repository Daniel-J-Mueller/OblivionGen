## Adaptive Proximity Beacon System - "Chrysalis"

**System Overview:**

Chrysalis extends the location-based establishment suggestion system by introducing a dynamic, multi-layered beacon network. Instead of *only* relying on GPS/location data from the user's device, Chrysalis utilizes a network of low-energy Bluetooth beacons, strategically placed *within* establishments and along likely travel routes. These beacons don't just indicate *presence*; they broadcast contextual data, influencing the recommendation algorithms in real-time. 

**Hardware Components:**

*   **"Moth" Beacons:** Low-power Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons deployed within establishments. These beacons have configurable broadcast ranges and broadcast data packets containing:
    *   Establishment ID
    *   Real-time occupancy level (calculated via beacon density/signal strength)
    *   Current promotional offers/specials
    *   “Vibe” score – a weighted average of noise level (via microphone), lighting level (via sensor), and social media sentiment (via API integration).
    *   Dynamic “attraction radius” – a configurable value that influences the weighting of the establishment in the user’s recommendation feed.
*   **“Larva” Route Beacons:**  Smaller, solar-powered beacons placed along frequently traveled routes (e.g., sidewalks, bike paths). These beacons primarily broadcast route identification, speed recommendations (based on traffic conditions), and points of interest (POIs) related to the route.
*   **User Device Integration:** The user’s mobile device continuously scans for both “Moth” and “Larva” beacon signals. 

**Software/Algorithmic Components:**

1.  **Beacon Signal Fusion:** Received beacon signals are fused with traditional location data (GPS, Wi-Fi) to create a highly accurate and contextualized user profile.
2.  **Dynamic Preference Modeling:** The algorithm dynamically adjusts user preferences based on beacon-derived data. For example:
    *   If the user consistently bypasses establishments with high “vibe” scores, the algorithm de-weights “vibe” as a preference factor.
    *   If the user frequently lingers in establishments with specific promotional offers, those offers are prioritized.
3.  **“Serendipity Engine”:** The algorithm intentionally introduces establishments slightly *outside* the user’s typical preference range, weighted by the “attraction radius” and the user’s “openness to discovery” score (derived from past behavior).
4.  **“Swarm Intelligence” Layer:** Aggregate data from all user devices is used to create a real-time map of establishment popularity, route congestion, and emerging trends.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Algorithm):**

```
function recommendEstablishments(userLocation, userPreferences, beaconData) {

  establishments = getNearbyEstablishments(userLocation)

  for each establishment in establishments {

    score = 0

    // Preference Matching
    score += calculatePreferenceScore(establishment, userPreferences)

    // Beacon Influence
    if (beaconData.establishmentBeaconDetected(establishment.id)) {
      score += beaconData.getVibeScore(establishment.id) * userPreferences.vibeSensitivity
      score += beaconData.getOccupancyLevel(establishment.id) * userPreferences.crowdSensitivity
      score += beaconData.getPromotionScore(establishment.id) * userPreferences.dealSensitivity
    }

    // Serendipity Factor
    randomness = generateRandomNumber(0, 1)
    serendipityScore = randomness * userPreferences.opennessToDiscovery * (1 - score)

    establishment.finalScore = score + serendipityScore
  }

  sort(establishments, by: finalScore, descending: true)
  return topN(establishments, 5) // Return top 5 recommendations
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Hyper-Personalized Recommendations:**  Deliver recommendations that are not only relevant to the user’s preferences but also reflect the *current* state of the establishment.
*   **Dynamic Route Optimization:** Adjust routes in real-time based on congestion, weather, and user preferences.
*   **Smart City Applications:**  Use aggregated beacon data to monitor pedestrian traffic, optimize public transportation, and improve urban planning.
*   **Retail Engagement:**  Trigger personalized promotions and offers based on the user’s proximity to specific products or displays.
