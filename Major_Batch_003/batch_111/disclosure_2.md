## Dynamic Obstruction Mapping & Predictive Node Placement

**Concept:** Extend the patent's obstruction awareness beyond static, mapped objects to *dynamic* obstructions – moving vehicles, temporary construction, even weather phenomena – and proactively adjust node placement to maintain connectivity *before* disruptions occur.

**Specifications:**

**I. Sensor Integration Layer:**

*   **Input:** Integrate real-time data feeds from multiple sources:
    *   **Traffic APIs:** Google Maps, Waze, etc. – vehicle locations & predicted paths.
    *   **Weather APIs:**  Radar, precipitation forecasts (snow, heavy rain impacting signal).
    *   **Computer Vision (Optional):**  Cameras at node locations for local obstruction detection (construction equipment, temporary barriers).
    *   **Node-to-Node Signal Monitoring:** Constant RSSI monitoring between nodes to identify weakening signals *before* complete loss.
*   **Data Fusion:** Implement a Kalman Filter or similar algorithm to fuse data from multiple sources, predict future obstruction locations, and estimate the probability of signal blockage.

**II. Predictive Pathing & Connectivity Modeling:**

*   **Obstruction Footprint:**  Define an ‘obstruction footprint’ – a 3D volume representing the potential blockage area, accounting for obstruction height, width, and predicted movement.
*   **Ray Tracing Engine:**  Adapt a ray tracing engine to model signal propagation, factoring in:
    *   Static map data (buildings, terrain).
    *   Dynamic obstruction footprints.
    *   Node antenna characteristics (gain, beamwidth).
    *   Weather impact (signal attenuation due to rain/snow).
*   **Connectivity Graph:**  Maintain a dynamic connectivity graph representing the network topology. Nodes are connected if the ray tracing engine predicts a line-of-sight link with sufficient signal strength.

**III. Proactive Node Placement & Adjustment:**

*   **‘Shadow Node’ Concept:** Identify ‘shadow nodes’ – potential node locations that could maintain connectivity if a link is predicted to fail due to an approaching obstruction.
*   **Cost Function:** Define a cost function to evaluate potential node placements, considering:
    *   Number of recovered links (connectivity).
    *   Distance to existing nodes (deployment cost).
    *   Power consumption (node availability).
*   **Optimization Algorithm:** Employ a genetic algorithm or similar optimization technique to find the optimal set of ‘shadow nodes’ to activate/deploy *before* connectivity is lost.
*   **Automated Adjustment:**
    *   **Software-Defined Radio (SDR):** Nodes equipped with SDR can dynamically adjust antenna beamforming and transmit power to mitigate the impact of obstructions.
    *   **Mobile Node Deployment (Advanced):** For critical applications, consider small, mobile nodes (drones or ground robots) that can be dynamically deployed to fill coverage gaps.

**IV. Pseudocode for Dynamic Node Adjustment:**

```
// Main Loop (runs continuously)
For each Node in Network:
    Receive Signal Strength (RSSI) from neighboring nodes
    Receive Dynamic Obstruction Data (Traffic, Weather)
    Predict future obstruction locations

    //Ray Trace signal paths
    SimulateSignalPropagation(CurrentNetworkTopology, PredictedObstructions)

    //Identify weak/failed links
    For each Link in SimulatedNetwork:
        If SignalStrength < Threshold:
            Mark as Weak/Failed

    //Identify potential ‘Shadow Nodes’
    PotentialShadowNodes = FindOptimalNodePlacements(Weak/FailedLinks, DeploymentCost)

    //Activate/Deploy ‘Shadow Nodes’
    If PotentialShadowNodes.count > 0:
        ActivateNode(PotentialShadowNodes[0]) // Deploy if mobile node

    //Adjust SDR parameters (beamforming, power) to mitigate obstructions
    AdjustSDRParameters(ObstructionLocations, NodeAntennaCharacteristics)
```

**V. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Nodes with GPS and SDR capabilities.
*   Access to real-time traffic, weather, and potentially visual data feeds.
*   Edge computing capabilities at each node for local signal processing and prediction.
*   Centralized network management system for monitoring and coordinating node deployments.
