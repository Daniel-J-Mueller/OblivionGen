## Proactive Reminder-Based Skill Acquisition

**Concept:** Extend proactive reminders beyond simple task completion to facilitate *skill acquisition* based on observed user needs and contextual cues. Instead of just reminding a user *to do* something, the system proactively suggests learning a new skill *to help* with a recurring situation.

**Specs:**

**1. Skill Database & Proficiency Mapping:**

*   **Data Structure:**  A database of skills, each described by:
    *   `skill_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `skill_name`: Human-readable name (e.g., "Basic Excel Formulas", "Conflict Resolution", "Home Plumbing Repair").
    *   `skill_tags`: Keywords representing skill areas (e.g., "office productivity", "interpersonal", "DIY").
    *   `learning_resources`: List of URLs/IDs pointing to tutorials, courses, articles, etc.
    *   `contextual_triggers`: List of keywords/events that indicate a potential need for this skill (e.g., "spreadsheet error", "disagreement with coworker", "leaky faucet").
    *   `proficiency_levels`:  Scalable levels of expertise (e.g., "Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced").
*   **User Proficiency Profile:** Each user maintains a profile storing their current proficiency level for each skill in the database.  Initial values can be set to "Unknown" or determined through a brief onboarding questionnaire.

**2. Contextual Skill Need Detection:**

*   **Input Streams:** System monitors multiple data streams:
    *   User’s calendar events (meetings, appointments).
    *   User’s communication channels (email, chat – *with user permission and anonymization where appropriate*).  Focus on identifying keywords/phrases related to difficulties or recurring issues.
    *   Application usage (identifying apps related to specific tasks – e.g., frequent use of a drawing program might indicate a need for advanced design skills).
    *   System logs (error messages, application crashes).
*   **Trigger Identification:**  A rule-based engine (or machine learning model) analyzes these streams for matches to `contextual_triggers` associated with skills in the database.  Fuzzy matching is essential to account for variations in language.
*   **Priority Calculation:** Assign a priority score to potential skill recommendations based on:
    *   Frequency of the triggering event.
    *   Severity of the issue causing the event.
    *   Potential impact of acquiring the skill (estimated time savings, cost reduction, improved quality of work).

**3. Proactive Skill Recommendation & Learning Pathway:**

*   **Reminder Generation:** When a high-priority skill need is identified, the system generates a proactive reminder, *but instead of a task*, it presents a skill recommendation: "It looks like you're frequently encountering spreadsheet errors. Learning Basic Excel Formulas could help you work more efficiently."
*   **Learning Pathway Presentation:** Upon user acceptance, the system presents a curated learning pathway:
    *   Suggests relevant learning resources (from `learning_resources` associated with the skill).
    *   Provides an estimated time commitment to reach a specific proficiency level.
    *   Allows the user to schedule learning sessions directly in their calendar.
*   **Progress Tracking & Adaptive Learning:**  The system tracks the user's progress through the learning pathway:
    *   Monitors completion of learning resources.
    *   Administers short quizzes/assessments to gauge understanding.
    *   Adapts the learning pathway based on the user's performance.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function detect_skill_need(user_data, input_streams):
    skill_needs = []
    for stream in input_streams:
        for event in stream:
            for skill in skill_database:
                if skill.contextual_triggers contains event.keywords:
                    need = SkillNeed(skill, event, calculate_priority(skill, event))
                    skill_needs.append(need)
    return skill_needs

function present_recommendation(user, skill_need):
    message = "It looks like you're struggling with " + skill_need.event.keywords + ".  Learning " + skill_need.skill.skill_name + " could help."
    display_message_to_user(user, message)
    if user accepts recommendation:
        present_learning_pathway(user, skill_need.skill)

function present_learning_pathway(user, skill):
    resources = skill.learning_resources
    estimated_time = estimate_time_to_proficiency(skill, user.proficiency_level)
    display_resources_and_time_to_user(user, resources, estimated_time)
    allow_user_to_schedule_learning_sessions()
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply *reminding* users about tasks. It uses proactive reminders as a mechanism for *facilitating self-improvement and skill acquisition*, turning recurring problems into opportunities for learning. The system isn’t just reacting to the user’s needs, but proactively helping them address underlying issues.
