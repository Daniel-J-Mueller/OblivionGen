## Dynamic Collage Themes & Emotional Resonance

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple content-based collage generation to incorporate dynamically shifting visual *themes* and attempt to align collage aesthetics with detected user emotional state.

**Specification:**

**1. Emotion Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time data streams – camera feed (facial expression analysis), microphone (voice tone analysis), text input (sentiment analysis of recent messages/posts).  Optional integration with wearable sensor data (heart rate variability, skin conductance).
*   **Processing:** Employ a multi-modal emotion recognition AI model. Output a dominant emotional state (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, neutral) and confidence level.
*   **Output:**  Emotion vector (representing probability distribution across defined emotions).

**2. Theme Library:**

*   A curated library of visual themes. Each theme defined by:
    *   Color palettes (primary, secondary, accent colors)
    *   Font styles (headings, body text)
    *   Image filters (e.g., sepia, grayscale, vintage)
    *   Layout templates (grid, mosaic, stacked)
    *   Transition effects (fade, slide, zoom)
    *   Associated emotion profile (e.g., 'Joy' theme strongly linked to positive emotions).  Each theme can be weighted for multiple emotion matches.

**3. Dynamic Theme Selection:**

*   **Logic:** Based on the emotion vector, select the most appropriate theme from the theme library.
    *   Employ a weighted matching algorithm.  High emotion confidence levels increase theme influence.
    *   Implement a “theme momentum” factor – if a user consistently exhibits a certain emotion, gradually increase the likelihood of selecting the corresponding theme.
    *   Introduce a “surprise” factor – occasionally select a slightly different theme to avoid predictability.

**4. Collage Generation with Theme Application:**

*   **Content Selection:** Utilize existing content selection algorithms (metadata, recency, etc.).
*   **Visual Styling:** Apply the selected theme's visual elements to the collage:
    *   Background color/image
    *   Font styles for any overlaid text
    *   Image filters
    *   Layout arrangement
    *   Transitions between collage elements (if animated collage)

**5. User Feedback & Learning:**

*   **Implicit Feedback:** Track user interactions with the dynamically themed collage (view time, post to social media, shares, etc.).  Higher engagement suggests successful theme selection.
*   **Explicit Feedback:** Implement a simple "Like/Dislike" button for each collage.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Employ a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the theme selection process based on user feedback.  Reward positive interactions and penalize negative ones.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateDynamicCollage(user, contentPool):
  emotionVector = detectEmotion(user)
  theme = selectTheme(emotionVector, userHistory)
  collage = generateCollage(contentPool, theme)
  return collage

function selectTheme(emotionVector, userHistory):
  // Weighted matching algorithm to select theme based on emotionVector
  // Incorporate userHistory to learn preferred themes
  // Implement 'surprise' factor for occasional theme variation
  theme = bestMatchTheme(emotionVector, userHistory)
  return theme

function bestMatchTheme(emotionVector, userHistory):
  theme_score = {}
  for theme in themes:
    theme_score[theme] = 0
    //Calculate emotion affinity
    emotion_affinity = dot_product(emotionVector, theme.emotion_profile)
    theme_score[theme] += emotion_affinity * emotion_weight

    //User Preference
    if theme in user_history:
      theme_score[theme] += user_history[theme] * user_weight

  #Randomness
  random_element = random() * randomness_weight
  theme_score[random_theme] += random_element

  return max(theme_score)
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Ambient Lighting Integration:**  Synchronize collage color scheme with smart home lighting for an immersive experience.
*   **Music Integration:** Select background music that complements the collage's emotional tone.
*   **AR/VR Integration:**  Present dynamic collages in augmented or virtual reality environments.
