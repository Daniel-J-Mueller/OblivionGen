## Dynamic Availability Bubbles & Contextual Proximity

**Concept:** Expand the 'available contacts' display beyond simple video cards to a spatially-aware, dynamically updating 'bubble' representation, factoring in not just availability but *contextual proximity* – physical and digital.

**Specs:**

*   **Display:** Replace the flat ‘video card’ list with a 3D space (can be simulated 2D). Contacts are represented as semi-transparent, color-coded bubbles.
*   **Bubble Size:** Bubble size dynamically adjusts based on several factors:
    *   **Availability:** Larger bubble = more available.
    *   **Recent Interaction:**  Bubbles 'glow' or pulse briefly after recent communication.
    *   **Shared Context:**  Bubbles ‘cluster’ closer together based on shared calendar events, current application usage (e.g. working on the same document), or location (if permission granted).
*   **Spatial Awareness:**
    *   **Location (Optional):** If location permissions are granted, bubbles can be positioned roughly based on physical proximity.  Accuracy is not paramount; the *relative* distance is key.
    *   **Digital Proximity:** Algorithm analyzes shared digital spaces.  If two contacts are actively in the same online meeting, document collaboration, or are members of the same project group, their bubbles move closer.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   **Hover/Selection:** Hovering over a bubble displays detailed availability, status message, and quick access to communication options.
    *   **'Throw' Interaction:**  User can 'throw' a virtual object (e.g. a note, a quick question) toward a bubble to initiate a quick communication channel (chat, short audio message).  The 'throw' animation visually indicates the intent.
    *   **'Pull' Interaction:**  User can 'pull' a bubble closer for a more focused connection (video call, screen share).
*   **Filtering & Prioritization:**
    *   **'Focus' Modes:** User can select "Focus" modes (e.g., "Work," "Personal," "Urgent") which prioritize bubbles based on the selected context.
    *   **Relationship Tags:**  User can assign tags to contacts (e.g., "Manager," "Teammate," "Family") for customized filtering.
*   **Color Coding:**
    *   **Availability:** Green = Available, Yellow = Busy, Red = Do Not Disturb.
    *   **Urgency:**  Bubble color shifts subtly based on flagged urgency (e.g., message flagged as ‘urgent’).
*   **API Integration:**  Open API for integration with other applications (calendar, project management tools, messaging platforms).

**Pseudocode (Bubble Positioning):**

```
function calculateBubblePosition(contact, user):
  // Base position - screen center
  x = screenWidth / 2
  y = screenHeight / 2

  // Availability factor
  availabilityFactor = contact.availabilityScore * 50 // Scale 0-50

  // Proximity factors
  locationProximity = calculateLocationProximity(user, contact) // -100 to 100
  digitalProximity = calculateDigitalProximity(user, contact) // -50 to 50

  // Calculate offsets
  xOffset = (locationProximity + digitalProximity) * 5
  yOffset = availabilityFactor * 2

  // Final position
  x = x + xOffset
  y = y - yOffset

  return (x, y)
```

**Note:**  The UI/UX should emphasize a playful, intuitive feel. The system isn’t about perfectly replicating physical proximity, but about *suggesting* connections based on a blend of factors.  It should be easily customizable and non-intrusive.
