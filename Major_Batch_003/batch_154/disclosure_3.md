## Dynamic Contextual GUI Shards

**Concept:** A GUI that breaks down into semi-autonomous, contextually aware "shards" which float and re-arrange themselves based on user interaction and data relevance. These aren’t simple widgets, but miniature, dynamically-sized interfaces that *feel* almost physically present.

**Specs:**

*   **Shard Definition:** Each shard is defined by:
    *   `data_source`: Pointer to data stream or object.
    *   `visualization_type`: Enum (graph, map, text, icon array, custom).
    *   `interaction_mode`: Enum (passive, tap-to-expand, drag-and-drop, voice-command).
    *   `priority_weight`: Integer (determines initial placement and ‘push’ strength).
    *   `aesthetic_profile`: Defines color palette, transparency, shadow, and edge styling.
*   **Spatial Engine:** A physics-inspired engine governs shard placement and movement.  Key parameters:
    *   `repulsion_force`:  Shards repel each other slightly, preventing overlap.
    *   `attraction_force_user`: Shards are attracted to user input (touch, gaze, voice).
    *   `gravity_well_data`: Data importance influences a 'gravity well' - higher importance means stronger pull towards the center of the screen *or* towards other related shards.
    *   `damping_factor`: Controls the speed at which shards settle.
*   **Data Binding:**  Each shard subscribes to its `data_source`. Changes in the data source trigger a smooth visual update of the shard.  Use asynchronous data loading to prevent UI freezes.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   **Tap:** Expands shard to full screen, revealing detailed data.
    *   **Drag:** Allows manual repositioning, overriding the spatial engine.  Releasing the shard allows it to settle back into the dynamic arrangement.
    *   **Voice Command:**  Assign keywords to shards for direct control ("Show me sales data," "Bring up the map").
*   **Shader Implementation:** Use a custom shader to achieve:
    *   Subtle glow and shadow effects.
    *   Particles that emanate from shards based on data changes.
    *   Smooth transitions between shard states (collapsed/expanded).
*   **Pseudocode for Spatial Calculation:**

```
function calculate_shard_position(shard):
    force = Vector2(0, 0)

    // Repulsion from other shards
    for other_shard in all_shards:
        if shard != other_shard:
            distance = distance_between(shard, other_shard)
            repulsion_magnitude = repulsion_force / distance^2
            direction = normalize(shard.position - other_shard.position)
            force += direction * repulsion_magnitude

    // Attraction to user input (touch/gaze)
    user_input_position = get_user_input_position()
    if user_input_position != null:
        direction = normalize(user_input_position - shard.position)
        attraction_magnitude = attraction_force_user
        force += direction * attraction_magnitude

    // Gravity well based on data importance
    importance = shard.data_source.get_importance()
    gravity_direction = normalize(screen_center - shard.position)
    gravity_magnitude = importance * gravity_well_data
    force += gravity_direction * gravity_magnitude

    // Apply damping
    force *= damping_factor

    // Update position
    shard.velocity += force
    shard.position += shard.velocity

    return shard.position
```

*   **Implementation Notes:**  Experiment with different visual effects for data updates. For example, shards could “ripple” or “pulse” when new data arrives.  Consider adding support for 3D shard arrangements.
