## Adaptive Iconography & Predictive UI

**Concept:** A display screen UI that dynamically alters icon appearance and element positioning *based on inferred user cognitive load*. The system isn't simply reacting to touch or gaze, but analyzing subtle biometric data (heart rate variability, micro-facial expressions captured via front-facing camera) to *anticipate* user frustration or overload.

**Specs:**

*   **Biometric Input:**
    *   Front-facing camera:  120Hz capture of micro-facial expressions (AU detection).
    *   Heart rate sensor (integrated into device):  Continuous monitoring of HRV.
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope: Detects device manipulation speed and force.
*   **Cognitive Load Inference Engine:**
    *   Algorithm: Bayesian network trained on data correlating biometric signatures with self-reported cognitive load (gathered during initial user onboarding/calibration).
    *   Output: Cognitive Load Score (CLS) – ranging from 0 (minimal load) to 100 (maximum load).  Updated in real-time (minimum 50Hz).
*   **UI Adaptation Rules:** (Example, customizable per application)
    *   **CLS 0-30:** Standard UI elements. Icon animations subtle.
    *   **CLS 31-60:** Icon size increases by 10%.  Animation speed decreases by 20%.  Color saturation increases slightly.  Spacing between tappable elements increases by 5%.
    *   **CLS 61-80:** Icon outlines become bolder. Frequently used icons ‘float’ slightly above the UI, increasing visual prominence.  Animation disabled.  Help prompts (contextual tooltips) appear proactively, but only once per element.
    *   **CLS 81-100:**  UI reduces to essential elements only.  Large, high-contrast icons.  Voice control becomes primary input method.  A calming, neutral color palette is enforced.  All non-critical animations are disabled. "Simplify" button prominently displayed, reducing available options further.
*   **Iconography System:**
    *   Vector-based icons.  Multiple versions of each icon pre-designed, optimized for different CLS levels (size, boldness, color, animation).
    *   Icon “families” linked to specific UI functions. Adaptation applies consistently across all instances of a family.
*   **Predictive Element Positioning:**
    *   Based on usage patterns and CLS, frequently used elements are “pre-positioned” in areas easily accessible by the user’s anticipated touch/swipe trajectory. (Based on a heat map of past interactions)
*   **Calibration Phase:**
    *   User undergoes a guided calibration process where biometric data is correlated with self-reported cognitive load. This establishes a personalized baseline.
*   **System Monitoring:**
    *   Continuous logging of biometric data, CLS, and UI adaptation actions for ongoing algorithm refinement.
