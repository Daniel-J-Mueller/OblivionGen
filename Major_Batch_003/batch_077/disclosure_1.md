## Dynamic Recommendation 'Echo' & Contextual Refinement

**Core Concept:** Extend personalized recommendations beyond immediate response entities. Instead of *only* referencing entities within the initial response, actively 'echo' related concepts and subtly refine recommendations based on a continuous assessment of user interaction *after* the initial recommendation is presented. This creates a more persistent, evolving recommendation 'thread' and anticipates future needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** 'Echo Module' – a persistent process integrated with the Recommendation Module.
*   **Data Source:** User Memory Graph (as defined in the provided patent), enriched with real-time interaction data (clicks, dwell time, subsequent queries, sentiment analysis).
*   **Operation:**
    1.  **Initial Recommendation:** Recommendation Module generates a recommendation as per the existing patent claims.
    2.  **Echo Seed:** Echo Module extracts *related* concepts from the User Memory Graph surrounding the entities in the initial recommendation.  These are *not* directly referenced in the immediate response, but represent broader interests.
    3.  **Passive Monitoring:** The Echo Module monitors subsequent user interactions.
    4.  **Contextual Refinement:**  Based on interaction patterns, the Echo Module adjusts the ‘weight’ of related concepts.
        *   **Positive Reinforcement:**  If the user interacts with content related to a concept, its weight increases.
        *   **Negative Reinforcement:** If the user actively avoids or dismisses related content, its weight decreases.
    5.  **Proactive Suggestion:**  After a defined interaction period (e.g., 5-10 subsequent queries), the Echo Module triggers a proactive recommendation, prioritizing concepts with the highest weight. This is presented as a "You might also like…" or "Based on your recent activity…" suggestion.
    6.  **Feedback Loop:**  User interaction with the proactive suggestion feeds back into the User Memory Graph, further refining the model.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Within Echo Module

function process_initial_recommendation(recommendation, user_memory_graph) {
  related_concepts = get_related_concepts(recommendation.entities, user_memory_graph);
  initialize_concept_weights(related_concepts);
  start_monitoring(user_memory_graph);
}

function get_related_concepts(entities, user_memory_graph) {
    //Query the user_memory_graph for concepts associated with entities
    //Return list of weighted concepts
}

function start_monitoring(user_memory_graph) {
    //Continuously listen for user interactions (queries, clicks, dwell time, sentiment)
    //Update concept weights based on interaction patterns
}

function update_concept_weights(interaction_data, concept) {
    //Increment/decrement concept weight based on positive/negative signals
}

function trigger_proactive_suggestion(user_memory_graph) {
    //Identify highest-weighted concepts
    //Generate proactive recommendation based on those concepts
    //Present recommendation to user
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Existing User Memory Graph infrastructure.
*   Real-time interaction data stream.
*   Sentiment analysis module.
*   Dedicated processing resources for Echo Module (can be integrated with existing Recommendation Module infrastructure).

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased recommendation relevance.
*   Improved user engagement.
*   Proactive identification of user needs.
*   More robust and evolving User Memory Graph.
