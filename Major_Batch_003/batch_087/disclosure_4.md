## Adaptive Content Personalization via Generative Meta-Modeling

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Expand the meta-modeling approach to *generate* model configurations, not just predict performance. Instead of evaluating pre-defined candidate models, the system will dynamically create and test new model architectures and configurations optimized for individual users.

**II. System Components:**

*   **User Profile Store:** As per the patent, but expanded to include behavioral data (clickstreams, dwell time, interactions) *and* explicitly stated preferences (ratings, saved items, etc.).
*   **Model Configuration Generator (MCG):** This is the key new component. It’s a generative AI model (e.g., a Variational Autoencoder or Generative Adversarial Network) trained on a vast dataset of successful model configurations and user profiles. It takes as input a user profile and outputs a complete model configuration – including model type (e.g., neural network, decision tree), layer architecture, hyperparameters, feature selection, and weighting.
*   **Rapid Model Trainer (RMT):**  A highly optimized engine capable of rapidly training models from the configurations generated by the MCG.  Must support diverse model types and be capable of training on limited data.
*   **Performance Evaluator (PE):**  As in the provided patent, assesses the performance of trained models.  However, it now focuses on a short-term evaluation cycle, as models are frequently replaced.
*   **Meta-Model Director (MMD):** Oversees the entire process.  It monitors performance, manages the MCG and RMT, and selects the best-performing model for each user.
*   **Model Attribute Store:** Now holds not just performance scores but also the *configuration details* of all tested models, enriching the training data for the MCG.

**III. Workflow:**

1.  **User Request:** A user interacts with the third-party system (e.g., views a webpage, searches for a product).
2.  **Profile Retrieval:** The system retrieves the user’s profile from the User Profile Store.
3.  **Configuration Generation:** The MMD feeds the user profile to the MCG. The MCG generates a model configuration.
4.  **Model Training:** The MMD instructs the RMT to train a model based on the generated configuration using available data.
5.  **Performance Evaluation:** The PE evaluates the trained model’s performance on a small subset of user data (e.g., A/B testing).
6.  **Model Deployment:** If the model performs well, it’s deployed to serve the user’s requests.
7.  **Continuous Optimization:** The process repeats continuously, generating and testing new models to refine personalization.
8.  **Attribute Storage:** Configuration details and performance metrics are stored in the Model Attribute Store.

**IV. Pseudocode (MMD):**

```pseudocode
function optimize_user_model(user_profile):
    model_configuration = MCG.generate_configuration(user_profile)
    trained_model = RMT.train_model(model_configuration)
    performance_score = PE.evaluate_model(trained_model, user_profile)

    if performance_score > best_score_for_user:
        deploy model to user
        update best_score_for_user
        store model_configuration and performance_score in Model_Attribute_Store

    return deployed_model
```

**V. Innovation:**

This system moves beyond *predicting* model performance to *actively creating* personalized models for each user. By leveraging generative AI, it can explore a much wider range of model configurations than traditional methods, leading to significantly improved personalization and user experience.  It effectively creates an adaptive, self-optimizing personalization engine.  This is not merely selecting the "best" from a pre-defined set, but creating something new and tailored for each user.
