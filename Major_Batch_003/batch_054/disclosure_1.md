## Dynamic Neural Network Partitioning & Federated Encryption

**Concept:** Implement a system where a neural network is dynamically partitioned across multiple devices, with each partition’s weights encrypted using a unique key derived from a federated key exchange protocol. This allows for both enhanced security *and* parallel processing, scaling beyond the limitations of a single machine. The encryption keys are not static; they rotate based on task completion and device proximity to mitigate potential compromise.

**Specifications:**

**1. Network Partitioning Module:**

*   **Input:** A trained neural network (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch model).  Partitioning granularity adjustable (layer-wise, block-wise within layers).
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyzes network architecture and dependencies.
    *   Generates a partitioning schema, assigning network segments to available edge devices (smartphones, IoT sensors, edge servers).  Schema optimization based on device processing capability and network bandwidth.
    *   Serialization/Deserialization routines for network segments to facilitate transmission and loading on remote devices.
*   **Output:**  Partitioned network segments, device assignments, and communication protocol specifications (e.g., gRPC, MQTT).

**2. Federated Key Exchange (FKE) Module:**

*   **Protocol:**  A Diffie-Hellman variant customized for resource-constrained devices. Incorporates device proximity sensing (Bluetooth, UWB) to improve security and reduce attack surface.
*   **Process:**
    *   Each device initiates a secure key exchange with neighboring devices participating in the network partition.
    *   Key derivation function incorporates device identity, location data, and a master seed (rotated periodically).
    *   Generated keys are used to encrypt/decrypt weights associated with the network segment residing on that device.
*   **Output:** Unique encryption keys for each device and segment. Periodic key rotation schedule.

**3. Runtime Execution Engine:**

*   **Input:** Partitioned network segments, encryption keys, input data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Data flows through the partitioned network, with each device processing its assigned segment.
    *   Data is encrypted/decrypted at the device boundary using the established keys.
    *   Asynchronous communication between devices to maximize throughput.
    *   Error handling and fault tolerance mechanisms to handle device failures.
*   **Output:** Processed data.  Performance metrics (latency, throughput).

**4. Key Management & Rotation Service:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Manages master seeds and key rotation schedules.
    *   Monitors device status and network conditions.
    *   Triggers key rotation based on predefined policies (time-based, event-based, security alerts).
    *   Secure storage of master seeds (Hardware Security Module - HSM).
*   **Output:** Updated keying material for network partitions. Security audit logs.

**Pseudocode (Runtime Execution Engine – Device Side):**

```
function process_data(input_data):
  encrypted_data = decrypt(input_data, device_key) //Using device's unique key
  processed_data = apply_network_segment(encrypted_data)
  encrypted_processed_data = encrypt(processed_data, device_key)
  return encrypted_processed_data
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Edge devices should include secure elements (e.g., TrustZone, secure enclave) to protect encryption keys.
*   High-bandwidth, low-latency communication links (e.g., 5G, Wi-Fi 6) for optimal performance.
*   Hardware accelerators (e.g., TPUs, GPUs) for efficient neural network processing.
