**Personalized “Cognitive Load” Balancing for Social Media Feeds**

**Core Concept:** Extend the sensitivity metric system to dynamically adjust feed content *complexity* based on individual user cognitive load, inferred from their time series data and potentially biometric inputs. The goal is to maximize engagement not by simply showing more content, but by showing *optimally complex* content at any given moment.

**Specs:**

1.  **Cognitive Load Inference Module:**
    *   Input: Individual time series data (as in the patent), optionally augmented by real-time biometric data (heart rate variability via wearable, facial expression analysis via camera).
    *   Processing: Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a GRU or LSTM – trained on a dataset correlating time series patterns/biometric signals with labeled cognitive load states (e.g., “low,” “medium,” “high”). This is a separate training process from the sensitivity model.
    *   Output: Real-time cognitive load estimate (a scalar value between 0 and 1).

2.  **Content Complexity Scoring:**
    *   Input: Each piece of content in the feed (text, image, video, links).
    *   Processing: Employ a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, GPT-3) and image/video analysis algorithms to assess content complexity. Metrics include:
        *   Text: Flesch-Kincaid readability score, sentence length, vocabulary diversity, presence of abstract concepts.
        *   Images/Videos: Visual clutter, number of identified objects, motion intensity, color palette complexity.
    *   Output: Content complexity score (a scalar value, normalized).

3.  **Dynamic Feed Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   Input: User’s current cognitive load estimate, content complexity scores of available feed items.
    *   Processing:
        *   Define a target cognitive load range for optimal engagement (e.g., 0.4 - 0.6). This range can be personalized based on user history.
        *   Sort feed items based on a weighted score:
            `FeedItemScore = (1 - |UserCognitiveLoad - TargetCognitiveLoad|) * ContentRelevanceScore - ContentComplexityScore`
        *   Prioritize feed items that minimize the difference between user’s cognitive load and the target, maximize relevance, and minimize complexity. Relevance can be determined by existing models (as outlined in the original patent).
    *   Output: Adjusted feed item order for display.

4.  **Adaptive Learning Loop:**
    *   Monitor user engagement (clicks, likes, shares, time spent viewing) with each feed item.
    *   Use reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning) to refine the target cognitive load range and weighting factors in the feed adjustment algorithm.
    *   Continuously update the cognitive load inference model with new biometric and behavioral data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
For each user:
    CognitiveLoad = InferCognitiveLoad(TimeSeriesData, BiometricData)
    FeedItems = GetAvailableFeedItems()

    For each FeedItem in FeedItems:
        ComplexityScore = CalculateComplexityScore(FeedItem)
        RelevanceScore = CalculateRelevanceScore(FeedItem, UserProfile)
        FeedItemScore = (1 - abs(CognitiveLoad - TargetCognitiveLoad)) * RelevanceScore - ComplexityScore
        FeedItem.Score = FeedItemScore

    SortedFeedItems = Sort(FeedItems, FeedItem.Score)

    Display(SortedFeedItems)

    UpdateModels(UserEngagementData)
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Biometric Data Integration:** Investigate the feasibility of using wearable sensors (heart rate variability, EEG) to provide more accurate cognitive load estimates.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Incorporate contextual information (time of day, location, device) into the cognitive load model.
*   **Personalized Complexity Preferences:** Allow users to explicitly specify their preferred level of content complexity.
