## Adaptive Resonance Focusing for Wireless Power & Data

**Concept:** Expand the surface wave propagation concept to actively shape and focus the electromagnetic field using a metamaterial ‘lens’ integrated into the surface waveguide. This allows for dynamic beamforming, directing power and data to multiple devices with increased efficiency and reduced interference.

**Specs:**

*   **Surface Waveguide Material:** High-conductivity copper or silver layer (50-100nm thickness) on a low-loss dielectric substrate (e.g., Rogers 4350B). Waveguide width adjustable (1-10cm) based on desired frequency range and number of devices.
*   **Metamaterial Lens:** Array of tunable metamaterial resonators positioned *above* the surface waveguide. Resonators fabricated using micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, allowing for individual control of capacitance and inductance. Resonator material: Tungsten or other high-density metal for MEMS actuation.
*   **Resonator Control System:** Dedicated microcontroller (e.g., ESP32) interfaced with MEMS actuators via a multiplexed digital interface.  Algorithm implemented to optimize resonator settings based on device location, power requirements, and data transmission rates.
*   **Device Identification & Tracking:**  Low-power Bluetooth beacons or Ultra-Wideband (UWB) tags embedded in target electronic devices.  Beacon data used by central controller to determine device location relative to waveguide.  Alternatively, utilize RF-ID tags.
*   **Frequency Range:**  Optimized for short-range communication (e.g., 6.78 MHz – 8.8 MHz for NFC, 2.4 GHz for Bluetooth/WiFi, or higher frequencies for increased data rates.)
*   **Power Level:** Adjustable power output (mW to Watts) controlled by central controller based on device requirements and safety constraints.
*   **Data Modulation:** Employ a combination of Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) and Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) to encode data onto the surface wave.
*   **Waveguide Geometry:**  Waveguide can be flexible (e.g., printed on a polyimide substrate) to allow integration into curved surfaces.
*   **Implementation:** Integrate the metamaterial ‘lens’ into a transparent polymer film applied directly to the waveguide.

**Novelty:**

Current surface wave wireless power transfer systems typically rely on static waveguide designs and lack the ability to dynamically focus energy.  This design introduces an active ‘lens’ composed of tunable metamaterial resonators, allowing for precise beamforming and improved efficiency.  The combination of dynamic focusing and data modulation enables a versatile system for both wireless power transfer and communication.
