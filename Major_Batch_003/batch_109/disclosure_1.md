## Proactive Sentiment-Based Communication Filtering & Augmentation

**Concept:** Extend the negative experience prediction beyond simply *adjusting* link presentation. Implement a system that proactively filters or augments messaging content *during* a conversation, based on real-time sentiment analysis, to mitigate negative experiences *as they happen*.

**Specs:**

**1. Real-Time Sentiment Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:**  Streaming text & image data from messaging conversations initiated via the links.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Utilize a combination of NLP (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) and computer vision models (CNNs, Transformers) to analyze sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of each message.
    *   Sentiment scoring: Assign numerical values to sentiment levels.
    *   Contextual analysis:  Consider message history and entity attributes (from the training data) to refine sentiment interpretation.  (e.g., sarcasm detection, understanding entity-specific language).
*   **Output:** Real-time sentiment score & classification for each message.

**2. Dynamic Filtering/Augmentation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Real-time sentiment score, entity attributes, user attributes, conversation history.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Thresholds:** Define dynamic thresholds for negative sentiment based on entity/user attributes (e.g., a user known to be easily frustrated has a lower threshold).
    *   **Filtering:** If sentiment exceeds the negative threshold:
        *   **Soft Blocking:** Delay message delivery by a short duration.
        *   **Content Moderation:** Flag potentially problematic content for review (by human moderators or automated systems).
        *   **Message Rewriting (Cautious):**  Using a generative AI model, subtly rephrase potentially inflammatory messages while preserving meaning. (Requires robust safeguards to prevent misinterpretation or bias.)
    *   **Augmentation:**  If sentiment is neutral or slightly positive:
        *   **Proactive Suggestions:**  Present the entity (or user) with suggested responses or topics to maintain a positive conversation flow. (e.g., "Based on the conversation, you might ask about X.")
        *   **Sentiment Boosters:**  Inject positive language or emojis into suggested responses.
*   **Output:** Filtered/Augmented message stream.

**3. Feedback Loop & Model Refinement:**

*   **Data Collection:** Log all filtered/augmented messages, user feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down on suggestions), and conversation outcomes (e.g., user blocking, positive/negative survey responses).
*   **Model Retraining:**  Periodically retrain the sentiment analysis and filtering/augmentation models using the collected data to improve accuracy and effectiveness.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Implement A/B testing to evaluate the impact of different filtering/augmentation strategies on user experience and conversation outcomes.

**Pseudocode (Filtering Logic):**

```
function filterMessage(message, sentimentScore, entityAttributes, userAttributes) {
  negativeSentimentThreshold = calculateThreshold(entityAttributes, userAttributes);

  if (sentimentScore > negativeSentimentThreshold) {
    // Apply filtering logic
    if (isHumanModerationRequired(entityAttributes)) {
      delayMessageForHumanReview(message);
    } else {
      rewriteMessage(message); // cautious rewrite
    }
  }
  return message;
}
```

**Novelty:**  This moves beyond simply *predicting* negative experiences to *actively mitigating* them *during* the interaction. The dynamic thresholds and proactive augmentation strategies create a more nuanced and personalized communication experience. The continuous feedback loop ensures ongoing improvement and adaptation to different user and entity profiles.
