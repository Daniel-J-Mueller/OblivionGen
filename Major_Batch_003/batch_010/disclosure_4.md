## Adaptive Frequency Allocation for Multi-Beam Optical Communication

**Concept:** Expand upon the multi-channel communication described in the patent by dynamically allocating frequencies within each optical beam, leveraging subcarrier multiplexing (SCM) and coherent detection. This allows for improved spectral efficiency, resilience to atmospheric turbulence, and prioritization of data streams.

**Specs:**

*   **Optical Space Terminal Enhancement:** Integrate a programmable optical local oscillator (PLO) into each optical space terminal transceiver. The PLO must be capable of generating multiple, independently tunable carrier frequencies within the 1550nm band (C-band). Resolution: 12.5 GHz (channel spacing).
*   **Subcarrier Multiplexing (SCM) Implementation:** Implement SCM within the RF channel former. Each channel will be divided into multiple subcarriers. Data streams are assigned to subcarriers based on priority (e.g., real-time telemetry receives higher priority and dedicated subcarriers).
*   **Coherent Detection:** Replace direct detection with coherent detection at both optical space terminals and ground terminals. This allows for phase and polarization diversity reception, mitigating atmospheric effects and improving signal-to-noise ratio. Utilize digital signal processing (DSP) for demodulation and equalization.
*   **Adaptive Frequency Allocation Algorithm:** Develop a real-time algorithm running on the spacecraftâ€™s processing unit. The algorithm monitors the signal quality (SNR, bit error rate) of each subcarrier. Based on this monitoring, it dynamically reallocates subcarriers to different data streams or adjusts transmission power for each subcarrier to optimize overall throughput.
*   **Beam Steering Coordination:** The adaptive frequency allocation algorithm must coordinate with the optical beam control system. If a particular subcarrier experiences excessive interference or atmospheric distortion, the algorithm instructs the beam control system to slightly adjust the beam steering angle to minimize the impact.
*   **Multi-Beam Interference Mitigation:** Implement an interference cancellation scheme. Monitor for signals originating from neighboring beams. When detected, utilize adaptive filtering to suppress the interfering signal in the receiver.
*   **Ground Terminal Synchronization:** Ground terminals need to be synchronized with the spacecraft's PLO frequencies. This can be achieved through a pre-shared frequency table or a low-rate beacon signal transmitted from the spacecraft.
*   **Modulation Scheme:** Employ advanced modulation schemes (e.g., QAM, OFDM) to maximize data rate on each subcarrier.
*   **Error Correction:** Integrate robust forward error correction (FEC) codes (e.g., LDPC, Turbo codes) to improve data reliability.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Frequency Allocation Algorithm):**

```
// Variables:
// subcarrier_data[N] : array of data streams assigned to each subcarrier
// snr_values[N] : array of signal-to-noise ratio values for each subcarrier
// priority_levels[N] : array of priority levels for each data stream
// transmission_power[N] : array of transmission power levels for each subcarrier

function adaptive_frequency_allocation() {
    // 1. Monitor SNR of each subcarrier
    measure_snr(subcarrier_data, snr_values);

    // 2. Identify subcarriers with low SNR
    low_snr_subcarriers = find_low_snr(snr_values, threshold);

    // 3. Identify data streams with high priority
    high_priority_streams = find_high_priority(priority_levels, threshold);

    // 4. Reallocate subcarriers
    for each subcarrier in low_snr_subcarriers:
        for each stream in high_priority_streams:
            if stream is not already assigned to a subcarrier:
                assign stream to subcarrier
                adjust transmission_power(subcarrier, power_level)
                break

    // 5. Adjust transmission power for all subcarriers based on current SNR
    adjust_power_levels(snr_values, transmission_power)

    // 6. Optimize beam steering based on subcarrier performance (optional)
    optimize_beam_steering(subcarrier_data, transmission_power)
}
