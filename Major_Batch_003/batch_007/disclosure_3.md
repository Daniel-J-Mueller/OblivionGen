**Adaptive Content ‘Mood’ Injection**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Dynamically alter content presentation *beyond* targeting criteria, factoring in real-time user emotional state (detected via device sensors/permissions - camera micro-expressions, keyboard pressure, voice tone, etc.) to influence content 'mood'. This builds upon the patent's compatibility scoring, adding a layer of emotional resonance.

**II. Components:**

*   **Emotional State Detector (ESD):** A module accessing device sensors (with explicit user permission). Leverages computer vision (camera), NLP (text input), and audio analysis (microphone) to generate an ‘emotional vector’ representing user mood (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, neutrality).  The vector should be normalized and quantifiable.
*   **Mood Profile Database:**  A database associating content elements (images, colors, text phrasing, background music, animation styles) with specific emotional 'moods'. This requires a large corpus of content tagged by human annotators *and* algorithmic analysis of existing media.
*   **Content Adaptation Engine (CAE):**  The core logic that receives the ESD output, queries the Mood Profile Database, and dynamically adjusts content presentation.
*   **Compatibility Score Integration:** The CAE will integrate the ESD data with the existing compatibility scores from the patent. Emotional compatibility will become a weighting factor.
*    **Auction Price Adjustment:**  Adjust auction price based on predicted 'emotional engagement'. Higher emotional resonance = potentially higher bids.

**III.  Pseudocode (CAE):**

```
FUNCTION AdaptContent(targetUser, contentItem)

  emotionalVector = GetEmotionalState(targetUser) // From ESD

  compatibilityScore = CalculateCompatibilityScore(targetUser, contentItem) // Existing from patent

  emotionalCompatibility = CalculateEmotionalCompatibility(emotionalVector, contentItem)

  weightedCompatibility = (compatibilityScore * 0.7) + (emotionalCompatibility * 0.3) //Adjust weights as needed

  //Query Mood Profile Database for content adjustments based on weightedCompatibility
  contentAdjustments = QueryMoodProfileDatabase(weightedCompatibility)

  adjustedContentItem = ApplyContentAdjustments(contentItem, contentAdjustments)

  predictedEngagement = CalculateEngagementScore(adjustedContentItem, emotionalVector)

  adjustedAuctionPrice = CalculateAuctionPrice(adjustedAuctionPrice, predictedEngagement)

  RETURN adjustedContentItem, adjustedAuctionPrice
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateEmotionalCompatibility(emotionalVector, contentItem)
    //Calculate the 'distance' between the emotional vector and the 'emotional profile' of the content item
    //Use cosine similarity or other appropriate metric
    //Higher similarity = higher emotional compatibility
END FUNCTION
```

**IV.  Implementation Details:**

*   **Sensor Fusion:**  Aggregating data from multiple sensors for a more accurate emotional assessment. Kalman filtering or similar techniques can be employed.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  Strict adherence to privacy regulations.  All data collection requires explicit user consent and must be anonymized/encrypted.  Option for local processing only.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Rigorous A/B testing to validate the effectiveness of mood-adaptive content and optimize the weighting factors.
*   **Content Tagging Pipeline:** A scalable pipeline for tagging existing and new content with emotional profiles. This could involve human annotators, machine learning models, and crowd-sourcing.
*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** Implement a learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the weighting of compatibility scores based on user engagement data.
