## Adaptive Persona Synthesis for Multi-Perspective Response

**Concept:** Extend the multi-perspective response system by dynamically synthesizing 'personas' for each agent, influencing not only *what* information is retrieved but *how* it’s presented – its tone, complexity, and framing. This goes beyond simply executing tasks; it’s about creating distinct *voices* within the response.

**Specs:**

1.  **Persona Database:**
    *   A structured database containing numerous pre-defined personas (e.g., “Optimistic Expert”, “Skeptical Analyst”, “Layperson Explanation”, “Concise Reporter”). Each persona is defined by:
        *   **Lexical Profile:** A statistical representation of word usage, sentence structure, and stylistic preferences. (e.g., frequency of jargon, use of metaphors, emotional valence of language).
        *   **Knowledge Bias:** A weighting of knowledge domains.  (e.g., a “Financial Advisor” persona prioritizes economic data; a “Historian” prioritizes historical context.)
        *   **Response Template Library:** A set of pre-written phrases or sentence starters geared towards the persona's style.
        *   **Emotional Range:** Parameters defining the persona’s typical emotional expression.

2.  **Persona Assignment Module:**
    *   Receives the user query and dialog-intents.
    *   Dynamically assigns a persona to each agent based on:
        *   **Query Analysis:** Identifies the user’s likely informational needs and preferred communication style (e.g., technical vs. non-technical).
        *   **Agent Role:** Considers the inherent purpose of the agent. (e.g., a "Research Agent" might receive a "Data-Driven Analyst" persona, while a “Customer Support Agent” gets an “Empathetic Communicator” persona).
        *   **Contextual Awareness:** Uses prior interactions to refine persona selection.

3.  **Persona-Infused Task Execution:**
    *   When an agent executes a task, it operates under the assigned persona:
        *   **Knowledge Filtering:** Prioritizes information aligned with the persona’s knowledge bias.
        *   **Content Transformation:** Rewrites or re-frames retrieved data to match the persona's lexical profile. (e.g., translating technical jargon into plain language for a “Layperson” persona.)
        *   **Emotional Modulation:** Introduces emotional cues into the response based on the persona's emotional range.

4.  **Stitching Model Enhancement:**
    *   The stitching model now accounts for persona differences:
        *   **Voice Blending:** Attempts to create a cohesive multi-perspective response while preserving the distinct voices of each persona. (e.g., using transitional phrases to smoothly shift between different viewpoints.)
        *   **Persona Conflict Resolution:**  If personas produce contradictory information, the model can flag the conflict or present multiple viewpoints with clear attribution.

**Pseudocode (Stitching Model Enhancement):**

```
FUNCTION stitch_response(execution_results, personas):
  FOR each result IN execution_results:
    result.response = apply_persona(result.response, result.persona)

  sorted_results = sort_results_by_relevance(execution_results) // Existing functionality

  final_response = ""
  FOR each result IN sorted_results:
    IF result.persona.emotional_range.sadness > 0.5:
      transition = "Despite these concerns, "
    ELSE IF result.persona.lexical_profile.jargon_level > 0.7:
      transition = "In more technical terms, "
    ELSE
      transition = "Furthermore, "

    final_response += transition + result.response

  RETURN final_response
```

**Novelty:** The patent focuses on *what* information is retrieved. This expands on it by focusing on *how* the information is presented – shaping not just content, but voice and perspective. It moves beyond a collection of responses to a dynamic, multifaceted conversation.
