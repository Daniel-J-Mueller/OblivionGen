## Dynamic Content "Shadowing" for Predictive Engagement

**Core Concept:** Extend the reach inference beyond simple household counts. Instead of just knowing *how many* households saw content, predict *which specific individuals* within those households are most likely to engage *next*, based on "shadowing" their behavior with similar users.

**Specification:**

1.  **Behavioral Shadow Profiles:**  Create “shadow profiles” for each user. These profiles are not direct copies of user data, but weighted combinations of attributes from users exhibiting similar engagement patterns.  Weights are determined via a similarity metric (cosine similarity, Jaccard index) based on content preferences, engagement frequency, time of day, device type, and derived demographic features.

2.  **Household Engagement Graph:** Construct a graph representing engagement *within* households. Nodes are individual users. Edges represent observed interactions (e.g., one user sharing a link with another, co-viewing content). Edge weights reflect the strength/frequency of those interactions.

3.  **"Shadow Propagation" Algorithm:**
    *   **Input:** Content item, Household ID, User ID (of the initially observed user), a “propagation depth” (integer).
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Identify all other users within the Household (from the Household Engagement Graph).
        2.  For each other user:
            *   Calculate a “shadow score” – a weighted sum of:
                *   Similarity between the user’s shadow profile and the initial user’s shadow profile.
                *   Edge weight connecting the user to the initial user in the Household Engagement Graph.
                *   The user’s historical engagement with similar content.
            *   If the shadow score exceeds a threshold, predict that the user is likely to engage with the content.
        3.  Recursively repeat steps 2 & 3 for the predicted engaging users, decrementing propagation depth. Limit recursion to prevent runaway prediction.

4.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** Continuously refine shadow profile weights and prediction thresholds using real-time engagement data. Employ a bandit algorithm (e.g., Thompson Sampling) to optimize weight adjustments based on observed outcomes.

5.  **Model Training & Inference:**
    *   Train separate models for each household.
    *   Inputs: Content features, shadow profile features, Household Engagement Graph features, user history.
    *   Output: Probability of engagement for each user within the household.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function predict_engagement(content, household_id, initial_user_id, propagation_depth):
  household_graph = get_household_graph(household_id)
  other_users = household_graph.get_neighbors(initial_user_id)
  engaged_users = []

  for user in other_users:
    shadow_score = calculate_shadow_score(initial_user_id, user)
    if shadow_score > threshold:
      engaged_users.append(user)

    if propagation_depth > 0:
      new_engaged_users = predict_engagement(content, household_id, user, propagation_depth - 1)
      engaged_users.extend(new_engaged_users)

  return engaged_users
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Detailed user profiles (content preferences, demographics, device info).
*   Household affiliation data.
*   Household engagement graph data (interactions between users within households).
*   Real-time engagement data (clicks, views, shares, etc.).
