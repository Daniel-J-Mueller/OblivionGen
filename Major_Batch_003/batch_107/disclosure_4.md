## Dynamic Speculative Execution Zones

**Concept:** Instead of blanket protection for specific data, introduce the concept of *Dynamic Speculative Execution Zones* (DSEZs). These zones aren’t tied to the data itself, but to the *execution context* and are defined *during* speculative execution.

**Motivation:** The provided patent focuses on protecting data *before* speculative execution. This assumes we know *which* data is sensitive. DSEZs shift the focus to identifying *when* execution is operating in a sensitive context, allowing for finer-grained control and reduced overhead.  It moves protection from a static property of data to a dynamic property of execution.

**Specifications:**

**1. DSEZ Definition & Activation:**

*   **Contextual Markers:** Introduce special CPU instructions (`MARK_DSEZ_BEGIN`, `MARK_DSEZ_END`) which, when speculatively executed, define a region of code as a potential DSEZ. These instructions don’t inherently *protect* anything; they simply demarcate a zone.
*   **Dynamic Policy Engine:** A hardware-based policy engine monitors the execution stream for `MARK_DSEZ_BEGIN` and `MARK_DSEZ_END`. This engine maintains a stack of active DSEZs, layering them based on nested calls or code sections.
*   **Conditional Activation:** The `MARK_DSEZ_BEGIN` instruction accepts a condition code (e.g., a register value, a flag).  The policy engine *only* activates the DSEZ if the condition is met *during speculative execution*.  This allows for highly conditional protection – a zone is only active if specific conditions are true during the speculative run.

**2. Speculative Execution within DSEZs:**

*   **Speculative Check:** Every memory access within an active DSEZ triggers a *speculative check*. This check verifies if the access is allowed based on the current DSEZ’s policy.
*   **Policy Types:**  DSEZ policies are configurable (perhaps via a dedicated memory region) and can include:
    *   **Read Restriction:** Disallow all reads from the accessed memory location.
    *   **Write Restriction:** Disallow all writes to the accessed memory location.
    *   **Access Logging:** Log the speculative access (address, data) to a secure buffer.
    *   **Redirection:** Redirect the access to a safe, decoy memory location.
*   **Speculative Violation:** If a speculative access violates the DSEZ’s policy, a *speculative violation flag* is set.

**3. Validation & Rollback:**

*   **Non-Speculative Validation:** Once the instruction stream becomes non-speculative (branch resolution, etc.), the speculative violation flag is checked.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** If a violation occurred, the processor initiates a controlled rollback. This can include:
    *   Flushing the pipeline.
    *   Invalidating any speculatively cached data.
    *   Raising an exception.
*   **Policy Update:** After the rollback, the system can dynamically update the DSEZ policy based on the observed violation.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Code Section
MARK_DSEZ_BEGIN(condition_register)  // Start DSEZ, activated if condition is met
// ... sensitive code ...
memory_access(address, data) // Access triggers speculative check within DSEZ
// ... more sensitive code ...
MARK_DSEZ_END() // End DSEZ

// Hardware Implementation (simplified)
function speculative_check(address, data, active_dsez) {
  if (active_dsez != null) {
    if (active_dsez.policy.read_restriction && access_type == "read") {
      set_speculative_violation_flag()
    }
    // ... other policy checks ...
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This approach is distinct from simply tagging data. It focuses on *when* protection is needed, based on the *context* of execution.  The dynamic policy updates allow the system to learn and adapt to evolving security threats.  The conditional activation of DSEZs minimizes performance overhead when protection isn’t required.  It moves the responsibility of identifying sensitive data from the data itself to the execution context.
