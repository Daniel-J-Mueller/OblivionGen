## Dynamic Noise Profile Injection for Generative Models

**Concept:** Instead of *averaging* multiple images to create a target output, leverage the *unique* noise signature of each captured frame as a conditioning input to a generative adversarial network (GAN). This allows the GAN to learn to reconstruct an image *from* its noise, effectively learning a noise-aware image generation process.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:**
    *   Capture a sequence of images of a static scene in low light. Crucially, capture the raw sensor data *before* any image processing occurs. This preserves the noise characteristics.
    *   Simultaneously record the thermal profile of the image sensor during capture (temperature readings from multiple points on the sensor).
    *   Store both the raw images *and* the thermal sensor data for each frame.
2.  **Noise Profile Extraction:**
    *   For each raw image, subtract a dark frame (captured with the lens capped) to remove fixed pattern noise.
    *   Analyze the remaining noise in each image to create a “noise map” – a representation of the spatial distribution of noise variance and characteristics.  This can be achieved using techniques like wavelet decomposition or Fourier analysis.
    *   Combine the noise map with the thermal sensor data for that frame. This produces a “dynamic noise profile” for each image.
3.  **GAN Architecture:**
    *   **Generator (G):**  Takes a low-light input image *and* a dynamic noise profile as input.  The architecture should include a mechanism for “injecting” the noise profile into multiple layers of the generator network –  e.g., using adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) or similar techniques.
    *   **Discriminator (D):**  Takes either a real image (from the training set) or a generated image as input. It also receives the corresponding dynamic noise profile. The discriminator must be able to assess both the realism of the image *and* the consistency between the image and the noise profile.
4.  **Training Process:**
    *   Train the GAN using a loss function that combines:
        *   **Adversarial Loss:**  Standard GAN loss to encourage realistic image generation.
        *   **Noise Consistency Loss:** A loss function that penalizes the discriminator if the generated image's noise characteristics are inconsistent with the input noise profile. (e.g. Mean Squared Error between predicted noise and input noise)
        *   **Perceptual Loss:**  A loss function based on features extracted from a pre-trained convolutional neural network to ensure perceptual similarity between the generated and target images.
5.  **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Noise Injection:** Explore different noise injection methods, such as adding noise directly to feature maps or using learned modulation parameters to control the noise level.
    *   **Data Augmentation:** Augment the training data by adding synthetic noise with varying characteristics.
    *   **Hardware Acceleration:** Utilize GPUs or specialized hardware accelerators to speed up training and inference.

**Pseudocode (Generator):**

```
function generate(low_light_image, noise_profile):
  # Extract features from low-light image
  features = conv_net(low_light_image)

  # Adapt feature maps using noise profile
  adapted_features = adaIN(features, noise_profile)

  # Decode adapted features to generate enhanced image
  enhanced_image = decoder(adapted_features)

  return enhanced_image
```
