## Adaptive Wake Word Morphing & Contextual Activation

**Concept:** Extend the multi-assistant framework by allowing wake words to *morph* based on user context and predicted intent, and by introducing a contextual activation system that prioritizes assistant response based on environmental sensors & user activity.

**Specifications:**

**I. Morphing Wake Word System**

*   **Core Principle:** Instead of fixed wake words, the system maintains a probability distribution over 'wake word fragments'. These fragments can be combined dynamically to create a perceived wake word.
*   **Fragment Database:**  A database of phoneme/syllable-level fragments. Each fragment is tagged with:
    *   Assistant association (which assistant benefits from this fragment).
    *   Contextual weightings (weights associated with different environments, activities, etc.).
    *   Acoustic similarity score to common words/phrases (to minimize false positives).
*   **Contextual Analysis Module:**  Continuously monitors:
    *   User’s calendar/schedule.
    *   Location (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation).
    *   Connected device state (TV on, music playing, lights dim).
    *   Recent app usage.
    *   Ambient sound analysis (detecting traffic, music, speech).
*   **Dynamic Wake Word Construction:** Based on contextual analysis:
    1.  The system calculates a weighted probability distribution over available fragments.  Fragments associated with likely-needed assistants receive higher weights.
    2.  A sequence of fragments is *sampled* to construct a perceived wake word. This word is subtle, and may not even be *fully* pronounceable.
    3.  Acoustic model adaptation: The ASR engine adapts to the generated wake word, increasing detection accuracy.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateWakeWord(contextData):
  fragmentPool = getAvailableFragments(contextData) // Filters by assistant & context
  weightedPool = weightFragments(fragmentPool, contextData) // Assigns weights
  sampledFragments = sampleFromWeightedPool(weightedPool, desiredWordLength)
  generatedWakeWord = concatenateFragments(sampledFragments)
  adaptASRModel(generatedWakeWord)
  return generatedWakeWord
```

**II. Contextual Activation Prioritization**

*   **Multi-Sensor Input:**  Integrate data from:
    *   Microphone array (direction-of-arrival detection).
    *   Camera (facial expression, object recognition).
    *   IMU (user activity – walking, driving, stationary).
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, light level, air quality).
*   **Activity Inference:**  Use sensor fusion and machine learning to infer the user's current activity. (e.g., 'cooking', 'driving', 'in a meeting', 'watching TV').
*   **Assistant Prioritization Matrix:**  Define a matrix that maps activity to assistant preference. (e.g., 'cooking' -> kitchen-focused assistant prioritized; 'driving' -> navigation/communication assistant prioritized).
*   **Response Throttling:** If multiple assistants are triggered simultaneously:
    1.  The system analyzes the activity context.
    2.  The preferred assistant for the current activity is selected.
    3.  Other assistants are temporarily silenced or deferred.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function prioritizeAssistant(activityContext, triggeredAssistants):
  preferredAssistant = getPreferredAssistant(activityContext)
  if preferredAssistant != null:
    return preferredAssistant
  else:
    // No clear preference, return the first triggered assistant
    return triggeredAssistants[0]
```

**III. Implementation Details**

*   **Hardware:**  Requires a powerful processor, sufficient memory, and a multi-sensor array.
*   **Software:**  Machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch), signal processing libraries, ASR engines, and a custom context management module.
*   **Data Collection:**  Requires a large dataset of user activity and associated sensor data for training machine learning models.
