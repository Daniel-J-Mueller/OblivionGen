## Dynamic Visual Code Layers for Contextual Access

**Concept:** Expand the digital visual code concept beyond simple feature unlocking to a layered system providing *contextual* access to information and functionality based on scan location *and* environmental data. Instead of a single code unlocking a single feature, create a code that adapts its meaning based on where it’s scanned and what’s happening *around* the scan.

**Specs:**

*   **Code Generation:** The system generates visual codes comprised of concentric circles, anchor points, and orientation anchors as described in the source patent. However, these codes are now constructed with multiple “layers” of data encoded within. Each layer corresponds to a specific context.
*   **Contextual Data Integration:** The system integrates data from the scanning device’s sensors (camera, microphone, GPS, accelerometer, ambient light sensor, etc.) *during the scan*. This data becomes part of the “context” for code interpretation.
*   **Layered Data Encoding:** Each concentric circle (or designated section) represents a distinct layer of information. Layers could encode:
    *   **Primary Function:** The core action, like unlocking a feature (as in the original patent).
    *   **Environmental Data Trigger:** A condition based on sensor data (e.g., “If ambient light is low…”).
    *   **Geolocation Trigger:** A specific geographical area.
    *   **Time-Based Trigger:**  A time window during which the code is active.
    *   **User Profile Data:** Access to information based on user preferences.
    *   **AR Overlay Data:**  Instructions for an augmented reality experience.
*   **Dynamic Interpretation:** The scanning device’s software analyzes the scanned code *and* the current sensor data. It then selects the appropriate layer(s) to activate based on matching criteria. 
*   **Action Execution:** Upon layer selection, the system executes the corresponding action. Actions could include:
    *   Unlocking software features.
    *   Displaying context-specific information (e.g., directions, product details, historical facts).
    *   Triggering AR experiences (e.g., placing virtual objects in the environment).
    *   Adjusting device settings (e.g., brightness, volume).
    *   Initiating communications (e.g., sending a text message, making a phone call).

**Pseudocode (Scanning Device Logic):**

```
function scanVisualCode(image):
  codeData = decodeVisualCode(image)
  sensorData = getSensorData() // Camera, GPS, light, accelerometer etc.
  activeLayers = []

  for layer in codeData.layers:
    if layer.isTriggeredBy(sensorData):
      activeLayers.append(layer)

  if activeLayers.length > 0:
    executeActions(activeLayers)
  else:
    displayMessage("Code is inactive in this context.")
```

**Example Use Case: Museum Exhibit**

A visual code is placed on a museum exhibit.

*   **Layer 1 (Primary):**  Displays a basic description of the artifact.
*   **Layer 2 (Geolocation):**  If scanned within 5 meters of the exhibit, triggers an audio guide narration.
*   **Layer 3 (Time):** If scanned between 9am-11am, displays a behind-the-scenes video.
*   **Layer 4 (Ambient Light):** If ambient light is low, increases the screen brightness for better visibility.
*   **Layer 5 (User Profile):** If the user has "accessibility mode" enabled, provides a text transcript of the audio guide.
