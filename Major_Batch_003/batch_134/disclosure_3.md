## Dynamic Contextual Persona Synthesis

**Concept:** Augment the existing auto-completion system by dynamically synthesizing a user persona based on real-time interaction data, then biasing both intent and slot completion towards that persona. This goes beyond static personalized language models by creating an ephemeral "current self" for the user, responding to the nuances of the *current* session.

**Specs:**

1.  **Persona Data Sources:**
    *   **Immediate Input Analysis:**  Analyze the sentiment, complexity, and topics within the current user input stream (last 5-10 interactions).  Keywords, entities, and emotional tone are extracted.
    *   **Session History:** Track user actions within the current session (e.g., previously selected options, confirmations, corrections).
    *   **Short-Term Memory:** Maintain a rolling window of user preferences revealed within the last hour (e.g., preferred restaurants, music genres, news sources).
    *   **Long-Term Profile (Optional):**  Access existing user profile data as a seed, but heavily weight the above real-time data.

2.  **Persona Synthesis Engine:**
    *   Employ a vector database to store embeddings of user traits (e.g., "tech enthusiast," "budget-conscious," "traveler").
    *   The Persona Synthesis Engine dynamically calculates a weighted average of trait vectors based on data from the sources above.  Recent interactions have the highest weight.
    *   Output: A persona vector representing the current user state.

3.  **Intent & Slot Completion Bias:**
    *   Modify the scoring function for intent and slot auto-completions. 
    *   Calculate a cosine similarity between the persona vector and the embedding of each candidate intent/slot.
    *   Add a bias term to the score, proportional to the cosine similarity. This effectively promotes suggestions that align with the synthesized persona.
    *   **Pseudocode:**

```
score = base_score + (persona_similarity * bias_weight)
```
4.  **Adaptive Bias Weight:**
    *   Implement a feedback mechanism to adjust the `bias_weight`.
    *   If the user consistently overrides auto-completions, reduce the `bias_weight`.
    *   If the user accepts most suggestions, increase the `bias_weight`.

5.  **Persona Visualization (Debugging/UX):**
    *   Provide a visual representation of the synthesized persona for internal debugging and potentially for user transparency (e.g., a "mood" indicator).

6.  **Edge Cases & Fallbacks:**
    *   If insufficient data is available to synthesize a persona, revert to a standard personalized model or a generic fallback.
    *   Implement safeguards to prevent the system from making overly aggressive assumptions based on limited data.
