## Adaptive Sensory Prioritization for Predictive Capture - "Pre-Moment" System

**Concept:** Extend the cascading model policy concept to *predict* interesting moments *before* they happen, rather than reacting to changes *during* an activity. The system will learn user-specific ‘pre-moment’ signatures – subtle sensory shifts that consistently precede personally meaningful events. This moves beyond simply capturing moments *of* activity to capturing the buildup *to* moments.

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensory Input:** IMU, Audio, GPS, EMG, Visual (Camera), Heart Rate Variability (HRV – new sensor addition).
*   **Pre-Moment Database:** A user-specific database storing sequences of sensor data leading up to events the user has *explicitly* marked as ‘interesting’ (via post-capture review and labeling). This is the core learning component.
*   **Predictive Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on the Pre-Moment Database. The LSTM will learn to predict the probability of an ‘interesting moment’ occurring within a defined timeframe (e.g., the next 5-10 seconds) based on current and recent sensor data.
*   **Adaptive Capture Trigger:** A tiered triggering system:
    *   **Tier 1 (Low Probability – 20-40%):** System begins *pre-buffering* visual data from all cameras at a reduced frame rate (e.g., 5-10 fps). Audio is also pre-recorded. This minimizes storage impact.
    *   **Tier 2 (Medium Probability – 40-70%):** Frame rate increases to a standard rate (e.g., 30 fps). Predictive model begins to analyze facial expressions and body language for additional indicators.
    *   **Tier 3 (High Probability – 70-90%):** System initiates full capture with all sensors. Advanced stabilization algorithms are activated.
    *   **Tier 4 (Near Certainty – 90-99%):**  System triggers ‘HyperCapture’ – a very short burst of extremely high frame rate video (e.g., 240 fps) to ensure critical details are not missed.
*   **Cascading Model Policy Integration:** The existing cascading model policy (cost/relevance) determines *which* sensors are prioritized for feeding into the Predictive Model. Sensors with lower cost/higher relevance are analyzed more frequently.
*   **User Feedback Loop:**  Users can rate captured pre-moments and moments, providing further training data for the Predictive Model and refining the cascading model policy.
*   **'Moment Sculpting' Interface:** Post-capture, the user can visually ‘sculpt’ the captured pre-moment and moment by adjusting the start/end points of the capture, effectively creating a personalized highlight reel.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Predictive Model):**

```
function predict_interesting_moment(sensor_data, user_model):
  # sensor_data: Vector of current sensor readings
  # user_model: LSTM model trained on user's pre-moment data

  # Concatenate recent sensor history (e.g., last 5 seconds)
  history = get_sensor_history(5)
  input_data = concatenate(history, sensor_data)

  # Predict probability of interesting moment
  probability = user_model.predict(input_data)

  return probability

function trigger_capture(probability):
  if probability > 0.90:
    activate_hypercapture()
  elif probability > 0.70:
    activate_fullcapture()
  elif probability > 0.40:
    activate_mediumcapture()
  elif probability > 0.20:
    activate_prebuffering()
  else:
    do_nothing()
```

**Novelty:** This system isn’t simply reacting to events, but *anticipating* them, creating a more immersive and emotionally resonant capture experience. The focus on ‘pre-moments’ moves beyond capturing the peak of an event to capturing the *feeling* leading up to it.
