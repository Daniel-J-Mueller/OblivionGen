## Adaptive Emotional Resonance in Media Montages

**Concept:** Extend the memory graph integration to incorporate real-time emotional analysis of the user *while* viewing the generated montage. Dynamically adjust the media selection, transitions, pacing, and even audio elements to maximize emotional resonance and engagement. This moves beyond simply *representing* memories to *amplifying* the emotional impact of revisiting them.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Emotion Capture:**
    *   Integrate facial expression analysis via client-side camera input.
    *   Analyze speech intonation and sentiment from user utterances (during and *between* montage viewing).
    *   Monitor physiological signals (heart rate variability, skin conductance) via wearable sensors (optional, but desired).
2.  **Emotional State Mapping:**
    *   Employ a machine learning model (trained on a large dataset of emotional expression and physiological data) to map raw sensor data to a discrete emotional state (e.g., joy, sadness, nostalgia, surprise).  Continuous output is preferred, with probability weighting on states.
3.  **Memory Graph Augmentation:**
    *   Augment the existing memory graph with *emotional tags* associated with each episodic memory node.  These tags are determined during the initial memory capture phase (e.g., user explicitly labels the emotional tone of a memory) and refined over time based on the user’s emotional response while viewing associated media.
4.  **Dynamic Media Selection & Adjustment:**
    *   **Algorithm:**
        ```pseudocode
        function adjustMontage(currentEmotionalState, memoryGraph, currentMediaClip):
          // Weighting factors (tunable parameters)
          emotionalAlignmentWeight = 0.7
          noveltyWeight = 0.3

          // Calculate emotional alignment score for candidate clips
          emotionalAlignmentScore = calculateEmotionalAlignment(currentEmotionalState, candidateClip.emotionalTags)

          // Calculate novelty score (based on viewing history)
          noveltyScore = calculateNovelty(candidateClip, userViewingHistory)

          // Combined score
          score = (emotionalAlignmentWeight * emotionalAlignmentScore) + (noveltyWeight * noveltyScore)

          // Select clip with highest score
          bestClip = selectClipWithHighestScore(score)

          // Adjust clip parameters (duration, transition, audio) based on emotional state
          adjustedClip = adjustClipParameters(bestClip, currentEmotionalState)

          return adjustedClip
        ```
    *   **Clip Adjustment:**
        *   *Duration:*  Prolong clips evoking positive emotions; shorten clips evoking negative emotions.
        *   *Transitions:* Utilize smooth, flowing transitions for positive emotions; faster, more jarring transitions for negative/intense emotions.
        *   *Audio:*  Dynamically adjust background music tempo and key; incorporate sound effects that amplify the emotional tone.
        *   *Color Grading:* Shift color palettes to emphasize emotional undertones (e.g., warmer tones for joy, cooler tones for sadness).
5.  **Adaptive Pacing:**
    *   Adjust the overall montage pacing based on the user’s emotional state.  Faster pacing during periods of high arousal; slower pacing during periods of calm or reflection.
6.  **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Continuously monitor the user’s emotional response to the adjusted montage and refine the adaptation algorithm over time. Utilize reinforcement learning to optimize the adaptation strategy for each individual user.
