## Dynamic Metamaterial Waveguide Array

**Concept:** A waveguide array where each individual waveguide’s properties (refractive index, effective aperture) are dynamically controlled via integrated micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) mirrors and a metamaterial layer. This allows for real-time beam steering, shaping, and polarization control *within* the waveguide itself, rather than relying solely on external optics or the initial input beam characteristics.

**Specs:**

*   **Waveguide Material:** Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) – chosen for its high electro-optic coefficient and ability to support guided modes at desired wavelengths.  Dimensions: 500nm width, 1um height, variable length (1cm - 10cm).  Array density: 500 waveguides/mm.
*   **Metamaterial Layer:** Thin film of periodically patterned gold nanorods deposited *on top* of the LiNbO3 waveguides.  Periodicity: 100nm - 300nm.  Nanorod dimensions: 20nm x 80nm (variable based on desired spectral response). Controlled dielectric environment via microfluidics.
*   **MEMS Mirrors:** Individually addressable MEMS mirrors integrated *within* the waveguide structure, positioned above the metamaterial layer. Mirror dimensions: 20um x 20um.  Tilt range: +/- 5 degrees.  Actuation: Electrostatic.  Mirror material: Gold.
*   **Control System:** FPGA-based control system with dedicated drivers for each MEMS mirror and microfluidic valve.  Communication Protocol: SPI.  Data Rate: 10MHz.
*   **Light Source Compatibility:** Designed for operation with wavelengths from 400nm – 700nm. Accepts polarized and unpolarized light.
*   **Microfluidic System:** Integrated microfluidic channels for precisely controlling the dielectric environment around the metamaterial nanorods.  Fluid: High refractive index fluid (e.g. immersion oil) with adjustable concentration.
*   **Power Requirements:** 5V DC, 2A (typical).

**Innovation Details:**

1.  **Dynamic Refractive Index Control:** The MEMS mirrors dynamically adjust the light path within the waveguide. By tilting the mirrors, we can vary the effective coupling into and out of the metamaterial layer.  The metamaterial layer, in turn, is tuned via the microfluidic control. This allows precise and localized changes to the effective refractive index of the waveguide mode.
2.  **Mode Shaping:** The combination of MEMS mirror control and metamaterial tuning enables complex mode shaping within the waveguide. By creating spatially varying refractive index profiles, we can create arbitrary beam shapes at the output of the waveguide.
3.  **Polarization Control:** By carefully designing the metamaterial structure, we can create polarization-sensitive elements within the waveguide. The MEMS mirrors control the relative intensity of different polarization components, allowing for dynamic polarization control.
4.  **Beam Steering:** By creating a refractive index gradient along the waveguide length, we can steer the output beam in any direction. The MEMS mirrors fine-tune the gradient, providing precise beam steering control.
