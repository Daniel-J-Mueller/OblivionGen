**Augmented Proximity Communication System**

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Client Device: Standard smartphone/tablet with camera, microphone, display, and wireless communication.
    *   Dedicated "Proximity Beacon" Device: Small, low-power device emitting modulated ultrasonic/IR signals. Designed to be affixed to physical objects or worn as jewelry. Multiple beacons may be used.
    *   Optional: AR/VR Headset compatibility.
*   **Software:**
    *   Core Application: Runs on client device, handles beacon detection, user identification, and content exchange.
    *   Beacon Management Module: Allows users to register/deregister beacons, associate them with profiles/identities, and set access permissions.
    *   Content Filtering Engine: Allows users to define what types of content are automatically exchanged based on beacon proximity and user profiles.
    *   AR Overlay Engine: For AR/VR integration, provides visual cues about beacon proximity and content being exchanged.

**Innovation Description:**

This system extends the concept of proximity-based content exchange beyond simple video streams. It introduces dedicated "Proximity Beacons" that act as digital identifiers for physical objects or people.  

Instead of solely relying on camera-based user detection (as in the provided patent), this system uses a hybrid approach. The client device continuously scans for beacon signals. When a beacon is detected, the system identifies the associated user profile and initiates content exchange *only if* the receiving user has granted permission for that specific beacon/user combination. 

The key innovation is the layering of permission controls at the *beacon level*. This allows for granular control over who can exchange content with whom, even when multiple people/objects are in close proximity.  

**Pseudocode - Content Exchange Logic:**

```
FUNCTION handleBeaconDetection(beaconID)

  userProfile = getUserProfileAssociatedWithBeacon(beaconID)

  IF userProfile IS NOT NULL THEN

    IF userProfile.permissionGrantedForContentExchange THEN

      IF receivingUser.isInFieldOfView(userProfile.cameraData) THEN
        establishConnection(userProfile)
        exchangeContent(userProfile)
      ENDIF

    ELSE

      //Request permission from receiving user.
      displayPermissionRequestPrompt(userProfile.name)

      IF permissionGrantedByReceivingUser THEN
        //Update userProfile with permissionGrantedForContentExchange = TRUE
        establishConnection(userProfile)
        exchangeContent(userProfile)
      ENDIF

    ENDIF
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Smart Retail:**  A customer walks near a product with a beacon – automatically displays product information, reviews, or AR demonstrations on their device.
*   **Interactive Museum Exhibits:**  Approach an artifact with a beacon – receive contextual information, audio guides, or 3D models.
*   **Enhanced Social Networking:**  Meet someone with a beacon – automatically exchange contact information or social media profiles (with permission).
*   **Secure Access Control:**  Use beacons for proximity-based authentication to unlock doors, access devices, or authorize transactions.
*   **Dynamic Advertising:**  Targeted ads displayed based on proximity to beacons in specific locations.
