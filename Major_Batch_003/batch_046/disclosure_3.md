## Dynamic Content ‘Constellations’

**Concept:** Extend the grid-based content feed by allowing content items to *temporarily* ‘break out’ of the grid and visually ‘constellate’ around a central item, driven by user interaction or AI prediction.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Data Structures:**

*   `ContentItem`: (Existing – as per patent) Includes aspect ratio, span value, content data. Add:
    *   `constellationWeight`: Float – Represents the item’s propensity to participate in a constellation. Higher weight = more likely to be included.  AI-driven, based on content similarity to currently focused item, user history, and trending data.
    *   `constellationRadius`: Integer – Maximum distance (in pixels) the item can move from its grid position during constellation formation.
    *   `constellationAnchor`: Boolean – Flag indicating if this item *can* serve as a central anchor for a constellation.
*   `Constellation`:
    *   `anchorItem`: `ContentItem` – The central item driving the constellation.
    *   `memberItems`: List of `ContentItem` – Items participating in the constellation.
    *   `formationTime`: Integer – Milliseconds for the constellation to form/dissolve.
    *   `currentFrame`: Integer – Tracks animation frame for constellation movement.

**2. Algorithm – Constellation Formation:**

1.  **Trigger:** User long-presses (or AI predicts interest in) a `ContentItem` designated as a `constellationAnchor`.
2.  **Anchor Selection:**  The triggered `ContentItem` becomes the `anchorItem` of a new `Constellation`.
3.  **Candidate Selection:** Identify neighboring `ContentItem`s (within a defined radius of the `anchorItem` within the grid) that meet the following criteria:
    *   `constellationWeight` > threshold (dynamic, based on user engagement)
    *   Not already part of another active `Constellation`.
4.  **Member Selection:** From the candidates, select a limited number of `ContentItem`s (e.g., 3-7) based on their `constellationWeight` and content similarity to the `anchorItem` (using AI-powered content analysis).
5.  **Positioning:**  Calculate the new position for each `memberItem`. This is achieved through a force-directed graph layout algorithm:
    *   Treat the `anchorItem` as a central node with a strong attractive force.
    *   Treat each `memberItem` as a node with repulsive forces between them.
    *   Apply a damping factor to prevent oscillation.
    *   Constrain positions within a defined area around the `anchorItem`.  The `constellationRadius` defines maximum spread.
6.  **Animation:**  Animate the movement of `memberItem`s from their original grid positions to their calculated constellation positions over `formationTime`. Use easing functions for smooth transitions.
7.  **Interaction:**  Allow users to interact with the constellation (e.g., drag `memberItem`s, dismiss the constellation).
8.  **Dissolution:**  When the user releases interaction or after a timeout, animate the `memberItem`s back to their original grid positions over `formationTime`.

**3.  System Architecture:**

*   **Content Feed Engine:**  Existing (as per patent) – responsible for receiving, ordering, and positioning content items in the grid.
*   **Constellation Manager:** New module responsible for:
    *   Triggering constellation formation.
    *   Managing `Constellation` objects.
    *   Coordinating with the Content Feed Engine to temporarily remove and reposition `memberItem`s during constellation formation.
    *   Handling user interaction with constellations.
*   **AI Engine:** New/Extended module responsible for:
    *   Calculating `constellationWeight` for each `ContentItem`.
    *   Performing content similarity analysis.
    *   Predicting user interest in constellation formation.

**4.  Pseudocode (Constellation Formation):**

```
function formConstellation(anchorItem):
  constellation = new Constellation(anchorItem)
  candidates = getNearbyCandidates(anchorItem)
  members = selectMembers(candidates)

  for each member in members:
    calculateConstellationPosition(member, anchorItem) //Force-directed layout

  animateMovement(members, originalPositions, constellationPositions, formationTime)

  //User interaction handling…

function calculateConstellationPosition(member, anchor):
  //Force-directed layout algorithm
  //Attractive force from anchor
  //Repulsive force between members
  //Damping factor
  //Constrain to radius
  return newPosition
```

**5.  Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Dynamic Radius:** Adjust `constellationRadius` based on content density and screen size.
*   **Content-Aware Layout:**  Use content type (image, video, text) to influence the layout of the constellation.
*   **Multi-Anchor Constellations:**  Allow multiple anchors to create more complex constellations.
*   **AR Integration:** Project constellations into the user’s real-world environment.
