## Adaptive Bitrate Streaming with Personalized Aesthetic Filters

**System Overview:**

This system extends adaptive bitrate streaming (ABS) by incorporating personalized aesthetic filters *during* the encoding process, dynamically adjusting filter parameters based on predicted user preference and network conditions. The goal is to provide a viewing experience optimized not only for bandwidth but also for aesthetic enjoyment, creating a unique, personalized stream for each user.

**Core Components:**

1.  **User Aesthetic Profile (UAP):** Each user has a UAP derived from implicit feedback (watch time, rewatches, pausing/rewinding on visually-rich segments) and explicit preferences (e.g., “I like vibrant colors,” “I prefer a cinematic look”). This profile is a vector of parameters representing aesthetic preferences (color saturation, contrast, sharpness, film grain, dynamic range, color temperature, etc.).
2.  **Content Analysis Module (CAM):** This module analyzes the incoming video content, identifying key aesthetic characteristics (dominant colors, scene types, motion levels, lighting conditions, etc.). The CAM output is a vector matching the UAP parameter space, representing the “native” aesthetics of the content.
3.  **Aesthetic Adjustment Engine (AAE):**  The AAE is the core of the system. It receives the UAP, CAM output, and current network bandwidth estimate. It calculates a set of adjustment parameters to modify the encoding process, effectively applying aesthetic filters in real-time.  The AAE utilizes a multi-objective optimization algorithm (genetic algorithm or similar) balancing aesthetic fidelity (minimizing the difference between the desired UAP and the encoded output) and encoding efficiency (minimizing bitrate while maintaining quality).
4.  **Encoding Pipeline:** A modified encoding pipeline incorporating the AAE's adjustments.  The pipeline allows for dynamic adjustment of encoding parameters like color grading curves, sharpening filters, noise reduction algorithms, and even subtle changes to contrast and brightness.
5.  **Bitrate Adaptation Logic:** Traditional ABS bitrate adaptation logic, integrated with the AAE. If bandwidth drops, the AAE can prioritize encoding parameters that minimize perceived quality loss for the user’s specific aesthetic profile (e.g., reducing sharpening rather than color saturation).
6.  **Client-Side Feedback Loop:** The client application continuously monitors user interaction (e.g., pausing, rewinding, seeking) and sends this data back to the server to refine the UAP and AAE parameters.

**Pseudocode (AAE - Core Logic):**

```pseudocode
function applyAestheticAdjustments(userProfile, contentAnalysis, bandwidth):
  // Define weighting factors for each aesthetic parameter
  weightingFactors = {
    colorSaturation: 0.3,
    contrast: 0.25,
    sharpness: 0.2,
    // ... other parameters
  }

  // Calculate desired aesthetic parameters based on user profile
  desiredParameters = userProfile * weightingFactors

  // Calculate difference between desired and content aesthetics
  aestheticDifference = desiredParameters - contentAnalysis

  // Adjust encoding parameters based on aesthetic difference and bandwidth
  // (Using a multi-objective optimization algorithm - e.g., Genetic Algorithm)
  encodingAdjustments = optimize(
    objective: minimize(aestheticDifference + bitrateCost),
    constraints: bitrate <= bandwidth
  )

  return encodingAdjustments
```

**Encoding Pipeline Modifications:**

*   **Color Grading:** Implement dynamic color grading curves controlled by the AAE.
*   **Sharpening/Blur:** Use adaptive sharpening/blur filters with parameters controlled by the AAE.
*   **Noise Reduction:** Apply noise reduction algorithms with adjustable strength based on the AAE.
*   **HDR/SDR Remapping:** Dynamically remap HDR content to SDR based on user preferences and device capabilities.

**Client-Side Considerations:**

*   **Aesthetic Profile Storage:** Securely store and update the user’s aesthetic profile.
*   **Bandwidth Monitoring:** Accurately monitor available bandwidth.
*   **Feedback Collection:** Collect and transmit user interaction data to the server.
*   **Rendering Pipeline Integration:** Ensure the client-side rendering pipeline can accurately display the dynamically encoded video.
