## Dynamic Content Provenance & Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Expand beyond deceptive *content* detection to establish a dynamic provenance and trust score for *content creators* and the *originating source* of content, influencing distribution not just based on individual item assessment, but a holistic trust network.

**Specs:**

1.  **Provenance Graph:**
    *   Construct a directed graph where nodes represent:
        *   Content Items (identified by hash/unique ID)
        *   Content Creators (user accounts)
        *   Originating Sources (websites, domains, apps)
    *   Edges represent relationships: "created by", "hosted on", "shared from", "cited".
    *   Edge weights represent confidence levels – initially derived from existing data (verified accounts, SSL certificates, domain age) but dynamically updated.

2.  **Trust Score Calculation:**
    *   Each node (Content Item, Creator, Source) is assigned a Trust Score (0.0 - 1.0).
    *   **Creator Trust Score:**
        *   Base score (e.g., verified account = 0.7).
        *   Weighted average of Trust Scores of content *created* (outgoing edges). Positive contributions for high-scoring content, negative for flagged content.
        *   Penalties for consistent policy violations (flagged content, takedown requests).
        *   Social Signal integration:  Analysis of shares/engagement from trusted sources.
    *   **Source Trust Score:**
        *   Base score (domain age, SSL cert, history of compliance).
        *   Weighted average of Trust Scores of content *hosted* (outgoing edges).
        *   History of hosting deceptive content/policy violations.
    *   **Content Item Trust Score:**
        *   Weighted combination of Creator Trust Score and Source Trust Score.
        *   Dynamic adjustment based on machine learning model (as in the original patent) – deceptive content lowers the score.

3.  **Distribution Algorithm:**
    *   Content Item's Trust Score is a primary factor in determining distribution rate.
    *   Tiered Distribution:
        *   **High Trust (0.8-1.0):** Full distribution, potential for amplification.
        *   **Medium Trust (0.5-0.8):**  Standard distribution.
        *   **Low Trust (0.2-0.5):** Limited distribution, potential for "shadowbanning" or requiring human review.
        *   **Very Low Trust (<0.2):**  Content flagged/removed.
    *   “Trust Propagation”:  High-trust content boosts the Trust Score of the creator and source, while low-trust content lowers it.
    *   “Source Diversity Bonus”:  Algorithm favors distribution from a diverse range of sources to avoid echo chambers and promote information exposure.

4. **Data Structures (Pseudocode):**

```
class Node:
  id: string
  trust_score: float
  outgoing_edges: list of Edge

class Edge:
  target_node: Node
  weight: float

ProvenanceGraph:
  nodes: dictionary (id -> Node)
  edges: list of Edge
```

5.  **API Endpoints:**

    *   `get_content_trust_score(content_id)`: Returns Trust Score for a content item.
    *   `get_creator_trust_score(creator_id)`: Returns Trust Score for a creator.
    *   `get_source_trust_score(source_id)`: Returns Trust Score for a source.
    *   `update_content_trust_score(content_id, score_change)`: Updates content score.

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond individual content assessment to a dynamic trust network, factoring in creator and source reputation.  This provides a more holistic and resilient system against the spread of deceptive information.  The “trust propagation” mechanism incentivizes good behavior and penalizes bad actors.
