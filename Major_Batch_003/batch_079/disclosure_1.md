## Dynamic Emoji/Character Creation Based on Real-Time Sentiment Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the contextual understanding of image characters beyond static document analysis to *live* emotional input, allowing for dynamic emoji/character generation mirroring the user’s current emotional state during communication.

**Specs:**

**I. Input Module:**

*   **Source:** Real-time audio/video feed from a communication application (e.g., video conferencing, voice messaging).
*   **Analysis:** Employ a multimodal sentiment analysis engine. This engine will analyze:
    *   **Facial Expressions:** Using computer vision algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural networks) to detect and classify facial expressions (joy, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, neutral).
    *   **Voice Tonality:** Analyzing audio input for pitch, rhythm, and intensity variations to gauge emotional state. Utilize speech emotion recognition (SER) models.
    *   **Textual Input (optional):** Analyze accompanying text messages or chat input to correlate with vocal/visual cues.
*   **Output:** A continuous emotional profile represented as a vector (e.g., [Joy: 0.8, Sadness: 0.1, Anger: 0.05, Surprise: 0.05]).  This is the core emotional state representation.

**II. Character Generation Module:**

*   **Character Library:** A database of parameterized image characters (base emojis, icons, custom shapes).  Each character possesses attributes such as:
    *   **Shape:** (Circle, square, heart, custom outline).
    *   **Color:** (RGB value).
    *   **Texture/Pattern:** (Solid, gradient, striped, dotted).
    *   **Animation:** (Static, pulsating, rotating, expanding).
    *   **Facial Features (if applicable):**  Eyes, mouth, eyebrows – each with parameterized attributes (size, shape, angle).
*   **Mapping Function:** A trained neural network (or rule-based system) that maps the emotional profile vector to specific character attribute values.
    *   Example: High Joy -> Bright yellow color, Expanding animation, Smiling face.  High Anger -> Red color, Sharp edges, Frowning face.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Character attributes are continuously adjusted based on the changing emotional profile.  A smoothing algorithm (e.g., moving average) prevents jarring transitions.

**III. Output/Display Module:**

*   **Integration:** Integrate the dynamic character output into the communication application.
*   **Display Options:**
    *   **Avatar Replacement:** Dynamically replace the user’s static avatar with the generated character.
    *   **Animated Overlay:** Display the generated character as an animated overlay on the video feed.
    *   **Emote Stream:** Generate a stream of dynamically generated emotes accompanying the user’s voice/video.
*   **Customization:** Allow users to customize the character library and mapping functions to personalize their emotional expression.

**Pseudocode (Character Generation):**

```
function generate_character(emotional_profile):
  character = base_character  //Default character
  
  //Map emotional values to character attributes
  joy_level = emotional_profile.joy
  sadness_level = emotional_profile.sadness
  anger_level = emotional_profile.anger

  character.color = map_range(joy_level, 0, 1, color_range_start, color_range_end) // map joy to color
  character.shape = select_shape(anger_level) // map anger to shape
  character.animation = animate(sadness_level) // map sadness to animation
  
  return character
```

**Novelty:** This extends the original patent's concept of understanding character *context* from static document analysis to *real-time emotional context*, enabling a new form of dynamic, emotionally-aware communication.  It's about expressive *generation* based on feeling, not just contextual *understanding*.
