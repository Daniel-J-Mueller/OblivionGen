## Dynamic Affect-Based Live Stream Prioritization

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the live stream recommendation patent by integrating real-time affective computing to prioritize streams based on predicted emotional impact on the viewer, moving beyond simple interest matching. The goal is to serve streams likely to evoke a *desired* emotional response – not just what the user *likes*, but what will make them *feel* a certain way.

**Components:**

1.  **Real-Time Affect Analysis Module:**  Processes live video frames to detect facial expressions, body language, and audio cues (tone, prosody) to estimate the emotional state of individuals *within* the stream.  This isn't about the viewer's emotion, but the emotion *being displayed* in the stream itself.  Output is a vector representing the dominant emotions present (e.g., Joy: 0.8, Sadness: 0.1, Anger: 0.05).  Utilizes a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for facial expression recognition combined with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for temporal analysis of emotional shifts.

2.  **Viewer Emotional Profile Database:** Stores each user's preferred emotional “trajectory”.  This isn’t just “likes happy content,” it’s a weighted sequence of desired emotional states over time. Example: User prefers a stream to start with moderate excitement, transition to calm contentment, then end with a feeling of inspiration.  This profile is built from implicit feedback (watch time, re-watches, shares) and explicit feedback (emotional ratings, “mood” selection).  Stored as a sequence of emotional state vectors with associated weights.

3.  **Emotional Compatibility Engine:**  Compares the real-time emotion vector of a live stream to the user’s emotional profile.  Calculates a "compatibility score" based on the alignment between the stream's current emotional state and the user's *desired* emotional state at that moment in the profile. Uses a dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm to handle variations in emotional pacing.

4.  **Prioritization Algorithm:**  Integrates the compatibility score with the existing interest-based ranking from the original patent.  A weighted sum combines both scores:

    `Final Score = (Weight_Interest * Interest_Score) + (Weight_Emotion * Compatibility_Score)`

    The weights ( `Weight_Interest`, `Weight_Emotion`) are adjustable parameters, potentially personalized based on user preferences. Streams with higher final scores are prioritized for display.

**Pseudocode (Prioritization Algorithm):**

```
function PrioritizeStreams(user, streams):
  for stream in streams:
    interest_score = CalculateInterestScore(user, stream) // Existing function from patent
    emotion_vector = AnalyzeStreamEmotion(stream) // Real-time analysis
    compatibility_score = CalculateCompatibilityScore(user, emotion_vector)
    final_score = (Weight_Interest * interest_score) + (Weight_Emotion * compatibility_score)
    stream.final_score = final_score
  
  Sort streams in descending order based on stream.final_score
  return sorted_streams
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `User Profile`:
    *   `user_id`: integer
    *   `interests`: list of strings
    *   `emotional_trajectory`: list of `EmotionalState` objects

*   `EmotionalState`:
    *   `emotion`: string (e.g., "Joy", "Sadness", "Excitement")
    *   `intensity`: float (0.0 - 1.0)
    *   `time_offset`: integer (seconds)

*   `StreamMetadata`:
    *   `stream_id`: integer
    *   `title`: string
    *   `category`: string
    *   `current_emotion_vector`: list of floats (representing emotion intensities)
    *   `final_score`: float

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The `AnalyzeStreamEmotion` function requires significant computational resources.  Consider using cloud-based processing and caching emotional analysis results.
*   The `emotional_trajectory` data requires a robust data collection and modeling strategy.  Reinforcement learning could be used to optimize the trajectory based on user engagement.
*   Privacy considerations are crucial.  Ensure user data is anonymized and protected.
