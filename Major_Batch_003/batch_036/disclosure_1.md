## Dynamic Node Mesh with Predictive LOS

**Concept:** Extend the patent's LOS determination beyond static logging to create a dynamic, predictive mesh network leveraging probabilistic modeling of node movement and environmental obstructions. This allows for proactively establishing connections *before* a node is even in range, minimizing latency and maximizing network resilience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Node Instrumentation:**

*   **IMU Integration:** Each node equipped with a 9-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer.  Data streamed locally and selectively to neighboring nodes/central coordinator.
*   **Low-Power Radar/LiDAR:** Short-range (5-10m) radar or LiDAR module for detecting immediate obstacles and refining positional accuracy. Data selectively transmitted.
*   **RF Signal Strength Mapping:** Continuous monitoring and logging of RF signal strength from surrounding nodes. Used as a proxy for proximity and potential LOS.
*   **Micro-Vibration Sensor:** Detects subtle vibrations indicative of movement (footsteps, machinery) to enhance movement prediction.

**2. Central Coordinator/Edge Processing:**

*   **Probabilistic Movement Modeling:**  A central coordinator (or distributed edge processing) uses incoming IMU, RF signal, vibration, and obstacle data to build probabilistic models of each node’s movement.  Kalman filters or Particle Filters are suitable algorithms.
*   **LOS Prediction Algorithm:** Based on the movement models and a pre-loaded (or dynamically updated) map of the environment (including known static obstructions - walls, furniture, etc), the system predicts which nodes are likely to come into LOS within a defined time horizon (e.g., 5-10 seconds).
*   **Pre-Connection Protocol:**  When the algorithm predicts LOS, it initiates a "pre-connection" protocol. This doesn't establish a full data connection, but rather a handshake and preliminary channel negotiation.  This reduces latency when actual data transfer is required.  This utilizes a low-power beaconing system.

**3. Data Flow & Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Node A (Example)
Loop:
    Read IMU Data
    Read Radar/LiDAR Data (Obstacle Detection)
    Transmit IMU/Radar Data (Selectively) to Neighbors/Coordinator
    Receive Signal Strength from Neighbors
    // ... other operations ...

// Coordinator/Edge Node
Loop:
    Receive Data from Nodes
    For Each Node:
        Update Movement Model (Kalman/Particle Filter)
        Predict Future Position
        For Each Other Node:
            Check for Predicted LOS (considering environment map)
            If Predicted LOS:
                Initiate Pre-Connection Protocol (Beaconing)
```

**4. Communication Protocol:**

*   **Dual-Band Radio:** Utilize both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands for improved reliability and reduced interference.
*   **Adaptive Data Rate:** Dynamically adjust data rates based on signal strength and predicted channel conditions.
*   **Low-Power Wake-Up Radio:** Implement a dedicated low-power radio for wake-up signaling (for pre-connection beaconing).

**5.  Map Integration:**

*   **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):** Integrate SLAM algorithms to create and update a dynamic map of the environment.  This can be done centrally or in a distributed manner.
*   **Crowdsourced Mapping:** Allow nodes to share map data, creating a more accurate and complete representation of the environment.
*   **Static Map Import:**  Allow for the import of pre-existing floor plans or CAD models.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **High-Speed Robotics:**  Seamless communication between robots in dynamic environments.
*   **AR/VR:**  Low-latency tracking and communication for immersive experiences.
*   **Smart Factories:**  Real-time monitoring and control of industrial equipment.
*   **Emergency Response:** Reliable communication in disaster zones.
