## Dynamic Channel Remixing & AI-Driven Story Evolution

**Concept:** Extend the channel functionality by allowing users to “remix” existing channels, creating derivative channels with modified content focus. Simultaneously, employ AI to suggest story evolutions *within* those channels, prompting users to contribute new content building on existing themes.

**Specs:**

**1. Remix Channel Functionality:**

*   **User Action:** A user viewing a channel can select "Remix Channel."
*   **Interface:** This triggers a "Remix Settings" overlay. Options include:
    *   **Content Filters:**  Sliders/checkboxes to adjust the weighting of existing story types within the channel (e.g., "Increase focus on stories with pets," "Reduce stories tagged with 'food'").
    *   **Content Exclusion:**  A list of specific user accounts or hashtags to *exclude* from the remixed channel.
    *   **AI Prompt Injection:** A text field where the user can input a guiding prompt for the AI (e.g., "Make this channel more upbeat," "Focus on travel destinations in Europe").
    *   **Channel Visibility:** Options for the remixed channel: Private (user only), Shared (limited group), Public.
*   **Channel Creation:** Upon confirmation, a *new* channel is created based on the user’s settings. The original channel remains unaffected.
*   **Channel Attribution:** The remixed channel displays a clear link back to the original channel and the user who performed the remix.

**2. AI-Driven Story Evolution:**

*   **Channel Analysis:**  The AI continuously analyzes the content within each channel. It identifies dominant themes, trending hashtags, and common visual elements.
*   **Prompt Generation:** Based on the analysis, the AI generates prompts designed to encourage users to contribute new stories. These prompts are tailored to the specific channel’s content.  Examples:
    *   "This channel is filled with sunset photos! Share your *most* breathtaking sunset shot."
    *   "Lots of recipes here! What's your family's secret ingredient?"
    *   "Users are sharing travel photos of Italy! Show us your favorite hidden gem in Rome!"
*   **Prompt Delivery:** Prompts are delivered to users in several ways:
    *   **In-Channel Notifications:**  A banner within the channel displays the prompt.
    *   **Personalized Suggestions:**  Users receive a notification suggesting they contribute to a channel where a relevant prompt exists.
    *   **AI-Assisted Story Creation:** When a user begins creating a story, the AI suggests relevant hashtags or themes based on the channel they’re contributing to.
*   **Content Moderation:**  AI filters ensure new submissions align with the channel’s themes (and the platform’s broader guidelines).

**3. Pseudocode: AI Prompt Generation:**

```
FUNCTION GeneratePrompt(ChannelData)
  // ChannelData contains: dominantThemes, trendingHashtags, commonVisualElements
  Prompt = ""

  IF dominantThemes CONTAINS "travel" THEN
    Prompt = "Share your favorite travel destination!"
  ELSE IF dominantThemes CONTAINS "food" THEN
    Prompt = "What's your go-to comfort food recipe?"
  ELSE IF trendingHashtags CONTAINS "#pets" THEN
    Prompt = "Show us your adorable furry friend!"
  ELSE IF commonVisualElements CONTAINS "sunset" THEN
    Prompt = "Capture the magic of a sunset!"
  ELSE
    Prompt = "Share something that makes you happy!" // Default prompt

  RETURN Prompt
END FUNCTION
```

**4.  Technical Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:**  AI analysis and prompt generation must be scalable to handle a large number of channels.  Distributed processing is essential.
*   **Data Privacy:**  User data used for channel analysis must be anonymized and protected.
*   **AI Bias:**  The AI should be trained on diverse datasets to avoid perpetuating biases in its prompts.
*   **API Integration:** The system needs APIs for channel creation, content retrieval, and AI prompt generation.
