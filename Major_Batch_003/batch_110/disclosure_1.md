## Dynamic Temporal Embedding Weighting for Proactive Recommendation

**Concept:** Extend the weighted page embedding approach to incorporate a proactive element. Instead of *only* weighting embeddings based on session data (position, time, duration), predict likely *future* page visits and dynamically adjust weights to prioritize those predictions. This creates a "look ahead" effect, recommending content the user is likely to be interested in *before* they explicitly search for it.

**Specs:**

1.  **Prediction Model:** Implement a separate, lightweight prediction model (e.g., a simple LSTM or Transformer) trained on historical session data. This model takes a sequence of page embeddings as input and predicts the *probability distribution* over the entire page corpus for the next page visit.

2.  **Dynamic Weight Calculation:** Modify the weight calculation for pooled page embeddings.  The original weights (based on position, time, duration) are retained as 'base weights'. A 'prediction weight' is calculated based on the prediction model's output.

    *   `Prediction Weight =  (Probability of Predicted Page) *  α `  where `α` is a tunable hyperparameter.

    *   `Final Weight = Base Weight + Prediction Weight`

3.  **Embedding Pooling:** Use the `Final Weight` to generate the pooled page embedding.  Standard weighted averaging or more complex pooling mechanisms (e.g., attention mechanisms) can be employed.

4.  **Recommendation Generation:** Use the pooled page embedding to identify candidate recommendations, as described in the original patent.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: User Session (sequence of page embeddings: E = [e1, e2, ..., en])
//        Prediction Model (PM)
//        Hyperparameter α

// 1. Predict next page embedding using PM
predicted_embedding = PM(E)  // Returns probability distribution over page corpus

// 2. Calculate Prediction Weight for each embedding in E
for i in range(len(E)):
    prediction_weight[i] = predicted_embedding[i] * α

// 3. Calculate Base Weights (based on position, time, duration – existing logic)
base_weight[i] = calculate_base_weight(E[i], session_data)

// 4. Calculate Final Weights
final_weight[i] = base_weight[i] + prediction_weight[i]

// 5. Generate Pooled Embedding
pooled_embedding = weighted_average(E, final_weight)

// 6. Generate Recommendations (using pooled_embedding – existing logic)
recommendations = generate_recommendations(pooled_embedding)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Prediction model should be lightweight and optimized for fast inference.
*   The prediction model can run on the same server as the recommendation engine, or on a separate dedicated server.
*   Scalability is crucial. The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users.
*   The system should be able to adapt to changing user preferences over time.
