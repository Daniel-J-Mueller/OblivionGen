## Dynamic Scene Reconstruction & Shared Augmented Reality Layer

**Concept:** Expand the static/dynamic area detection to reconstruct a simplified 3D scene representation *shared* across all participants in the video conference. This reconstructed scene then becomes a canvas for shared augmented reality experiences overlaid on the composite video feed.

**Specs:**

**1. Scene Reconstruction Module:**

*   **Input:** Individual video streams from each peer.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ Structure from Motion (SfM) and/or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms. These algorithms take multiple 2D images and reconstruct a sparse or dense 3D point cloud of the visible environment.
    *   **Peer-Specific Reconstruction:** Each peer's video stream undergoes independent SfM/SLAM processing.
    *   **Fusion & Consistency:**  A central server or distributed network node fuses the individual 3D reconstructions. This fusion involves:
        *   **Feature Matching:** Identifying common features (corners, edges, textures) across multiple reconstructions.
        *   **Bundle Adjustment:** Optimizing the 3D point cloud and camera poses to minimize reprojection error and achieve a consistent global representation.
        *   **Outlier Rejection:** Removing erroneous 3D points or camera poses.
    *   **Simplification & Encoding:** The fused 3D point cloud is simplified (reduced polygon count) and encoded for efficient transmission.  Prioritize surfaces visible from multiple viewpoints.

**2. Shared AR Layer Management:**

*   **AR Asset Library:** A repository of pre-built or user-created 3D models, textures, and animations (AR assets).
*   **AR Placement API:** Allows participants to place, scale, rotate, and animate AR assets within the reconstructed 3D scene.  AR asset placement is relative to the shared 3D world, ensuring consistent appearance for all viewers.
*   **Occlusion Handling:** AR assets should respect occlusion based on the reconstructed 3D scene.  Objects behind walls or other scene elements should be hidden.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Support for interactive AR elements (e.g., buttons, sliders, animations triggered by user input).

**3. Composite Video Generation:**

*   **Rendering Pipeline:**  A rendering pipeline that combines the individual video streams, the reconstructed 3D scene, and the AR layer.
*   **Viewpoint Adaptation:**  Adjust the rendering viewpoint for each viewer based on their camera position within the virtual 3D scene.
*   **Dynamic Lighting & Shadows:** Implement dynamic lighting and shadows that interact with both the real environment and the AR assets.
*   **Output:** Generate a composite video stream that includes the real-time video feeds, the reconstructed 3D scene, and the shared AR layer.

**Pseudocode (AR Asset Placement):**

```
function placeAsset(assetID, worldPosition, worldRotation):
    // Retrieve asset model from library
    assetModel = getAssetModel(assetID)

    // Transform asset based on world position and rotation
    transformedModel = applyTransformation(assetModel, worldPosition, worldRotation)

    // Add transformed model to shared 3D scene
    addModelToScene(transformedModel)

    // Broadcast placement information to all peers
    broadcastAssetPlacement(assetID, worldPosition, worldRotation)
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Collaborative Design Reviews:** Engineers can share and manipulate 3D models in real-time within the video conference environment.
*   **Remote Training & Education:**  Instructors can overlay interactive 3D diagrams and animations onto the real-world environment to provide more engaging training experiences.
*   **Virtual Whiteboarding:** Participants can create and share virtual whiteboards that are visible to all viewers.
*   **Immersive Storytelling:**  Storytellers can create and share immersive AR experiences that are overlaid onto the real-world environment.
