## Automated Defect Mapping & Targeted Polishing System

**System Overview:** A closed-loop system integrating high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) with a robotic polishing head. The system aims to identify defects *during* the polishing process and dynamically adjust polishing parameters for localized correction.

**Components:**

*   **High-Resolution OCT Scanner:** Mounted above the polishing surface, capable of real-time 3D surface mapping at micron-level resolution. Scanning frequency: 30 Hz. Wavelength: 1300nm.
*   **Robotic Polishing Head:** 6-axis articulated arm equipped with a small-diameter (5mm) polishing pad holder.  Integrated force sensor (0.1N resolution).  Capable of independently controlling pad pressure, rotation speed (50-2000 RPM), and lateral movement.
*   **Polishing Pad Material:** Modular pad system accepting a range of materials (diamond, SiC, silica) â€“ material selection programmable via software.
*   **Fluid Delivery System:** Precise micro-fluidic system for controlled delivery of polishing slurry and cleaning fluids.  Programmable flow rates (0.1-1 ml/min).
*   **Control System:** Real-time image processing and control algorithms.  User interface for process setup, monitoring, and data logging.  Software stack built on ROS2.
*   **Workpiece Stage:** XYZ stage with vacuum chuck to secure samples.  Programmable movement profile for automated polishing paths.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initial Scan:** OCT scanner performs a baseline surface scan of the workpiece. This data is used to create a 3D model of the surface.
2.  **Polishing Path Generation:** Software generates an initial polishing path based on the desired surface finish and geometry.
3.  **Real-Time Defect Detection:** During polishing, the OCT scanner continuously acquires data.  Image processing algorithms analyze the data to detect surface defects (scratches, pits, subsurface damage).
4.  **Dynamic Path Adjustment:**  Upon defect detection, the control system modifies the polishing path in real-time.  This includes:
    *   Adjusting polishing pad pressure and speed locally.
    *   Modifying the path trajectory to focus on the defect area.
    *   Changing polishing pad material if necessary.
5.  **Closed-Loop Control:**  The process repeats steps 3 and 4 until the desired surface finish is achieved.
6.  **Final Scan:**  A final OCT scan verifies the surface quality and generates a defect map.

**Pseudocode (Path Adjustment):**

```
FUNCTION AdjustPath(defect_location, defect_size, defect_depth)
  // Calculate required polishing intensity based on defect parameters
  intensity = CalculateIntensity(defect_size, defect_depth)

  // Adjust polishing pad pressure
  SetPadPressure(intensity * pressure_scale)

  // Adjust polishing pad speed
  SetPadSpeed(intensity * speed_scale)

  // Generate a localized polishing path around the defect
  path = GenerateCircularPath(defect_location, defect_size * 2)

  // Add the localized path to the overall polishing path
  overall_path = AppendPath(overall_path, path)

  RETURN overall_path
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Logging & Analysis:**

*   The system logs all process parameters (pad pressure, speed, slurry flow rate, path trajectory, OCT data).
*   Data can be used for process optimization and quality control.
*   Defect maps can be generated to identify areas requiring further attention.
