## Adaptive Beamforming via UE-Reported Interference Nulling

**Concept:** Enhance MIMO performance not just through precoding for desired users, but proactively nulling interference *as reported by the UEs themselves*. This moves beyond solely base station estimation to incorporate real-time UE-local interference awareness.

**Specifications:**

*   **UE Reporting Enhancement:** UEs, in addition to SRS and CQI, will periodically report estimated interference characteristics. This isn’t just interference *power*, but directional information – estimated angle-of-arrival (AoA) and strength of detected interfering signals. This could be a dedicated reporting channel or incorporated into existing reports. Reporting frequency is configurable based on mobility and channel conditions.
*   **Interference Nulling Matrix Generation:** The base station/DU uses these UE-reported interference profiles to create a nulling matrix. This matrix is *combined* with the existing precoding matrix. The goal is not just to maximize signal strength to desired UEs, but simultaneously minimize interference *as perceived by each UE*.
*   **Hybrid Beamforming:** The final transmit beamforming vector is a weighted sum of the precoding vector (optimized for signal strength) and the nulling vector (optimized for interference suppression). A weighting factor (α) dynamically adjusts the balance between signal maximization and interference minimization. α is determined based on channel conditions and UE interference reports. High interference reports lead to a higher α, prioritizing nulling.
*   **Dynamic Nulling Pattern Adaptation:** Nulling patterns are not static. The system continuously adapts the nulling matrix based on changing interference landscapes reported by the UEs. This necessitates fast, efficient matrix calculations.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **UE-Side Processing:** The UE estimates interference by analyzing received signals outside of the desired resource block/frequency band. Angle estimation can be performed using standard signal processing techniques (e.g., MUSIC, ESPRIT).
    *   **Base Station/DU Processing:**
        1.  Receive UE interference reports.
        2.  Estimate interference covariance matrix.
        3.  Calculate nulling vectors.
        4.  Combine nulling vectors with precoding vectors using weighting factor α.
        5.  Apply the combined beamforming vector to the transmit signal.
*   **Pseudocode (Base Station/DU):**

```
// UE Interference Report Structure
struct InterferenceReport {
  UE_ID: int;
  Interference_AoA: float[]; // Array of angles (degrees)
  Interference_Strength: float[]; // Corresponding strength values
};

// Main Processing Loop
for each received InterferenceReport report {
  // Update interference covariance matrix based on report
  update_interference_covariance(report);
}

// Precoding Matrix Calculation (standard MIMO process)
precoding_matrix = calculate_precoding_matrix(channel_estimates);

// Nulling Matrix Calculation
nulling_matrix = calculate_nulling_matrix(interference_covariance);

// Combine Matrices
weighting_factor = determine_weighting_factor(channel_conditions, UE_reports);
combined_matrix = (1 - weighting_factor) * precoding_matrix + weighting_factor * nulling_matrix;

// Apply to transmit signal
transmit_signal = combined_matrix * multi_user_data;
```

*   **Potential Benefits:** Improved signal quality, reduced interference, increased throughput, enhanced spectral efficiency, improved user experience.
