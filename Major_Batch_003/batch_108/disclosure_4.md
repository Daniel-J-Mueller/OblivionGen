## Adaptive Scene Complexity for Shot Boundary Detection

**Concept:**  Instead of relying solely on frame size or pixel differences, proactively assess the *complexity* of a scene within a video and dynamically adjust shot-change sensitivity.  High complexity scenes (e.g., crowds, foliage) naturally have more intra-frame change; low complexity scenes (e.g., a plain wall) demand higher sensitivity to detect even subtle changes.

**Specs:**

1.  **Complexity Metric:** Implement a spatial frequency analysis (Fast Fourier Transform - FFT) on each decoded I-frame. Calculate the average magnitude of the FFT across all spatial frequencies. Higher magnitude indicates greater texture/detail/complexity. Normalize this value to a range of 0-1.

2.  **Dynamic Threshold:**  Establish a base shot-change threshold (e.g., based on frame size difference or HOD/DOH).  Modify this threshold based on the normalized complexity metric.
    *   If Complexity > 0.7, *increase* the threshold.  More natural change is expected, so require a larger difference to trigger a shot boundary.
    *   If Complexity < 0.3, *decrease* the threshold.  Subtle changes are more meaningful in simple scenes.
    *   Linear interpolation between these values for intermediate complexity scores.

3.  **Temporal Smoothing:** Apply a moving average filter to the complexity metric over a short window (e.g., 5-10 frames) to reduce noise and prevent rapid threshold fluctuations.

4.  **Adaptive Learning:** Incorporate a feedback mechanism. If the system consistently flags false positives in high-complexity scenes, *slightly* increase the threshold adjustment factor for those scenes. Conversely, if it misses boundaries in low-complexity scenes, *slightly* decrease the adjustment. This allows the system to learn and adapt to the characteristics of specific video content.

5.  **Implementation Notes:**
    *   The FFT calculation should be optimized for speed.  Consider using a pre-calculated lookup table for common frequencies.
    *   The temporal smoothing window size should be adjustable based on the video frame rate.
    *   The learning rate for the threshold adjustment should be small to prevent instability.



**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each frame:
IF frame_type == I_Frame:
    decoded_frame = decode(frame)
    complexity = calculate_spatial_frequency_complexity(decoded_frame)
    smoothed_complexity = apply_moving_average(complexity)

    // Calculate dynamic threshold
    base_threshold = 0.1  // Example value
    if smoothed_complexity > 0.7:
        dynamic_threshold = base_threshold * 1.5 // Increase threshold
    else if smoothed_complexity < 0.3:
        dynamic_threshold = base_threshold * 0.5 // Decrease threshold
    else:
        dynamic_threshold = base_threshold

    // Shot boundary detection (using frame size difference as an example)
    frame_size_diff = abs(current_frame_size - previous_frame_size)
    if frame_size_diff > dynamic_threshold:
        flag_shot_boundary()

    // Update previous frame information
    previous_frame_size = current_frame_size
