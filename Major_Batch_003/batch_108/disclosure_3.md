## Ephemeral Spatial Messaging

**Concept:** Extend ephemeral messaging beyond direct recipients to a spatially aware environment. Messages aren’t just sent *to* people, but *to* locations, persisting only for a limited time within a defined physical space.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Augmented Reality (AR) engine integrated with the messaging system.
*   **Spatial Anchors:** Users define "spatial anchors" – specific points in physical space (e.g., a park bench, a museum exhibit, a room in a house) using AR tools. These anchors become message destinations.
*   **Ephemeral Zones:** When a user sends an ephemeral message to a spatial anchor, it creates an "ephemeral zone" around that anchor.  The size of the zone is adjustable.
*   **Proximity Activation:**  Other users with the app, who enter the ephemeral zone, will automatically see the message. Messages could appear as AR overlays on the environment, projected text, or audio cues.
*   **Persistence & Decay:** Messages have a defined lifespan. After the lifespan, the message automatically disappears. Visual/audio "decay" effects could indicate remaining time (e.g., fading text, decreasing volume).
*   **Privacy Controls:**
    *   **Public Zones:**  Anyone within the zone sees the message.
    *   **Follower Zones:** Only followers of the message sender can see the message.
    *   **Specific User Zones:**  Messages visible only to specifically designated users within the zone.
*   **Message Types:** Support for text, images, video, audio, and AR objects.
*   **Layered Messaging:** Multiple ephemeral messages can exist at a single spatial anchor.  New messages layer on top of older ones.  A "view history" (optional) could allow users to see recently expired messages in a ghosted form.
*   **Anchor Ownership/Management:** Users can “claim” anchors (with verification potentially) or create new ones.  This manages who can post messages to a location.  Public spaces would need moderation features.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Sending Message
function sendMessageToSpatialAnchor(senderID, anchorID, messageContent, lifespan, privacySetting) {
  message = createEphemeralMessage(senderID, messageContent, lifespan);
  message.privacySetting = privacySetting;
  associateMessageWithAnchor(message, anchorID);
  broadcastAnchorUpdate(anchorID); // Alert nearby users
}

// Receiving Message (User enters ephemeral zone)
function onUserEnterEphemeralZone(userID, anchorID) {
  messages = getMessagesAssociatedWithAnchor(anchorID);
  for each message in messages {
    if (userHasPermissionToView(userID, message.privacySetting)) {
      displayMessage(userID, message);
    }
  }
}

// Message Lifecycle Management (Background Process)
function manageMessageLifecycles() {
  for each message in allMessages {
    if (message.expirationTime < currentTime) {
      removeMessage(message);
    }
  }
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Location-Based Art Installations:**  Ephemeral digital art displayed at specific locations.
*   **Interactive Tourism:**  Historical information or clues revealed at landmarks.
*   **Event Marketing:**  Promotional messages triggered at event locations.
*   **Personalized Communication:** Leaving messages for friends or family at home or at shared locations.
*   **Gamified Experiences:** Treasure hunts or location-based challenges.
