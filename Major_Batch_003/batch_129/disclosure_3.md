## Dynamic Effect Composition via AI-Driven Procedural Generation

**Concept:** Extend the coordinated media effect system to allow for *procedural generation* of effects, dynamically combining pre-built "effect primitives" based on real-time data – environmental audio, user biofeedback, or even sentiment analysis of ongoing communication. This goes beyond simply triggering a pre-defined animation.

**Specs:**

*   **Effect Primitives Library:** A modular library of visual and auditory “primitives”. Examples: “sparkle”, “ripple”, “bloom”, “distortion”, “echo”, “tone shift”. Each primitive has defined input parameters (intensity, color, frequency, etc.) and output characteristics. Stored in a standardized format (JSON/Protobuf).
*   **AI Effect Composer Module:** A central module responsible for generating complex effects on-demand. This module utilizes a lightweight AI model (e.g., a rule-based system or a small neural network) trained to combine primitives based on input data.
*   **Real-Time Data Ingestion:** System capable of receiving diverse real-time data streams:
    *   **Audio Analysis:** Analyze ambient sound (e.g., music, speech) to extract features (tempo, key, volume, sentiment).
    *   **Biofeedback Integration:** Integrate with wearable sensors (heart rate, skin conductance) to capture user emotional state.
    *   **Communication Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze text/voice communication for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) using NLP.
*   **Effect Parameter Mapping:** A mapping system defining how real-time data influences effect parameters. This is configurable. Example: "Increase 'sparkle' intensity proportionally to user heart rate."
*   **Coordinated Activity Protocol Extension:** Extend the existing protocol to support:
    *   Transmission of real-time data streams between devices.
    *   Transmission of effect parameter mappings.
    *   Request/response for AI-composed effects.
*   **Device-Agnostic Rendering:** Effects must be renderable on diverse devices with varying capabilities (mobile, desktop, VR/AR). Utilize shaders and procedural generation techniques to adapt effect complexity.

**Pseudocode (AI Effect Composer Module):**

```
function ComposeEffect(realtimeData, effectMapping, primitiveLibrary) {
  // 1. Extract relevant features from realtimeData based on effectMapping.
  extractedFeatures = ExtractFeatures(realtimeData, effectMapping);

  // 2. Select base primitives based on extractedFeatures.  (Rule-based or NN prediction)
  selectedPrimitives = SelectPrimitives(extractedFeatures, primitiveLibrary);

  // 3. Modify primitive parameters based on extractedFeatures.
  modifiedPrimitives = ModifyParameters(selectedPrimitives, extractedFeatures);

  // 4. Combine primitives into a composite effect. (Layering, blending, etc.)
  compositeEffect = CombinePrimitives(modifiedPrimitives);

  // 5. Return the composite effect.
  return compositeEffect;
}
```

**Example Scenario:**

A video conference call. The AI analyzes the speaker's voice (sentiment) and the ambient room noise. If the speaker is enthusiastic and the room is quiet, a subtle "bloom" and "sparkle" effect are added to their video feed. If the speaker is stressed and there's loud background noise, a "distortion" and "echo" effect are added, visually conveying their state. These effects are dynamically generated and coordinated across all participants' devices.
