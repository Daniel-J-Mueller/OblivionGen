## Adaptive Haptic Storytelling System

**Concept:** Extend the coordinated activity framework to incorporate localized haptic feedback synchronized with graphical information. This moves beyond visual/auditory synchronization and adds a tactile dimension to shared experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Device Integration:** Support for a range of consumer-grade haptic devices (wearables – gloves, vests, bracelets, localized tactile pads) connected wirelessly (Bluetooth 5.0+).  Each device reports its capabilities (number of actuators, resolution, supported patterns) to a central coordination server.
*   **Haptic Effect Library:** A server-side library of pre-defined haptic ‘effects’. Effects are described using a standardized format:
    *   `effectID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `duration`: Milliseconds.
    *   `intensity`: 0-100 scale.
    *   `pattern`:  A time-series array of actuator activations (0-100) per haptic channel. Allows for complex textures and movements.
    *   `trigger`: Defines how the effect is triggered (e.g., “on event X”, “at time Y”, “linked to graphical element Z”).
*   **API Extension:** Add haptic control parameters to the existing API calls.
    *   `hapticEffectID`:  Identifier of the effect to play.
    *   `hapticIntensityOverride`:  Allow per-user intensity adjustment.
    *   `hapticLocation`: Specifies which haptic channels/actuators should be activated. (e.g., "leftHand", "chest", "all").
*   **Facial/Body Tracking Integration:**  Utilize facial/body tracking data (from devices or cameras) to dynamically map haptic feedback to specific areas of the user’s body. For example:
    *   If a character in a shared game is struck on the right arm, activate actuators on the user’s right bicep.
    *   During a book reading experience, simulate the texture of objects described in the text.
*   **Procedural Haptic Generation:**  Implement a procedural system to generate haptic effects on-the-fly based on visual elements.  For example:
    *   Analyze the edges and textures of an object in a 3D scene and translate that into a corresponding haptic pattern.
    *   Create a ‘wind’ effect by modulating the intensity of actuators across the user’s body.
*   **Coordinated Effect Prioritization:** A system to handle conflicts when multiple effects are triggered simultaneously.  Prioritization can be based on effect type, urgency, or user preferences.
*    **User Profile & Customization:**  Allow users to create profiles with preferred haptic intensity levels, effect preferences, and supported device configurations.

**Pseudocode Example (API Call with Haptic Data):**

```
POST /api/effect

{
  "coordinatedActivityID": "12345",
  "effectID": "swordSwing",
  "intensity": 75,
  "hapticLocation": "rightHand",
  "targetDeviceIDs": ["userA", "userB"],
  "graphicalModification": { /* data for visual change */ }
}
```

**Novelty:** The combination of device-agnostic coordinated effects with localized, dynamic haptic feedback goes beyond simple vibration and enables rich, immersive shared experiences.  The facial/body tracking integration adds a layer of realism and personalization. The API extensibility allows developers to easily integrate haptics into existing coordinated activities.
