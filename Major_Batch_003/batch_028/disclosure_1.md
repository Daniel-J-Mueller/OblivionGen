## Variable Geometry Airflow Shroud & Thermal Conduit

**Concept:** Expand upon the extensible air duct concept by integrating a variable geometry shroud that actively directs airflow *around* the hardware component, supplementing the direct cooling provided *through* the air duct. This combines directed airflow with a thermally conductive 'backbone' to rapidly redistribute heat.

**Specifications:**

*   **Shroud Material:**  Graphite-infused polymer composite – high thermal conductivity, lightweight, and moldable.
*   **Shroud Geometry:** Multi-segment construction. Each segment is independently actuated via micro-servo motors controlled by a thermal management IC. Segments can morph from a tightly closed position (drawer closed) to fully extended & shaped for maximum heat dissipation when the drawer is opened.
*   **Actuation System:**
    *   Thermal Management IC: Monitors component temperature and calculates optimal shroud geometry. Utilizes a pre-programmed thermal map and adapts in real-time.
    *   Micro-Servo Motors: Miniature, high-precision motors embedded within each shroud segment.
    *   Flexible Joints: Connect segments, allowing for smooth, controlled movement.
*   **Thermal Conduit Integration:**
    *   A hollow core runs *through* the extensible air duct and the shroud segments.
    *   This core is filled with a phase change material (PCM) – a substance that absorbs/releases large amounts of heat during phase transitions (e.g., solid to liquid).
    *   PCM composition optimized for the expected operating temperature range of the hardware.
    *   The core connects directly to a heat pipe embedded in the chassis base, facilitating heat transfer *away* from the drawer.
*   **Extensible Air Duct Modifications:**
    *   Duct constructed from a flexible, thermally conductive fabric reinforced with carbon nanotubes.
    *   Internal ribs designed to guide airflow and prevent collapse.
    *   Integrated sensors to monitor airflow rate and temperature.
*   **Control Logic (Pseudocode):**

```pseudocode
// Global Variables
hardware_temp = 0.0
airflow_rate = 0.0
drawer_state = "closed" // "open" or "closed"

// Function: Update System State
function update() {
  hardware_temp = read_temperature_sensor();
  drawer_state = read_drawer_sensor();

  if (drawer_state == "open") {
    extend_airduct();
    activate_shroud_actuators();
    calculate_optimal_shroud_geometry(hardware_temp);
    adjust_shroud_segments();

  } else {
    retract_airduct();
    deactivate_shroud_actuators();
  }
}

// Function: Calculate Optimal Shroud Geometry
function calculate_optimal_shroud_geometry(temp) {
  // Access pre-programmed thermal map
  // Use temp as input to determine optimal segment angles
  // Consider airflow direction and component layout
  // Output: array of segment angles
}

// Function: Adjust Shroud Segments
function adjust_shroud_segments() {
  // Iterate through each segment
  // Set servo motor angles based on calculated values
}
```

*   **Chassis Integration:**
    *   Dedicated slots and mounting points for the shroud assembly.
    *   Heat pipe integration with the chassis cooling system.
    *   Power and data connections for sensors, actuators, and control IC.
