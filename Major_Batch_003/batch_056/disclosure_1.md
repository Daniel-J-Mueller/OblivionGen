## Dynamic Granularity Location Prediction

**Concept:** Expand upon the existing location prediction by introducing dynamically adjustable granularity levels. Instead of fixed geographic units (country, city, zip code), the system will assess the *predictive power* of each granularity level for a specific network address and adaptively select the most accurate representation.

**Specs:**

*   **Granularity Levels:** Define a hierarchy of geographic granularities: Continent -> Country -> Region -> City -> Postal Code -> Map Tile (e.g., 1km x 1km).  Each level contains associated learning features.
*   **Predictive Power Metric:** Develop a metric to assess the “predictive power” of each granularity level. This could be based on entropy, standard deviation of location data, or a machine learning model trained on historical location data.  Lower entropy or standard deviation = higher predictive power.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm:**
    1.  **Initial Assessment:** For a new network address, start with a broad granularity (Country).
    2.  **Data Collection:** Gather historical location data (if available) or initial data points.
    3.  **Granularity Evaluation:** Calculate the predictive power metric for each granularity level based on the collected data.
    4.  **Level Selection:**  Choose the granularity level with the highest predictive power.  A threshold can be set – if the predictive power difference between levels is minimal, remain at the current level.
    5.  **Continuous Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor the predictive power of the selected level. If the predictive power drops below a threshold, trigger a re-evaluation of granularity levels.
*   **Level-Specific Weighting Factors:** Each granularity level has its own weighting factor, determined by learning features specific to that level. For example:
    *   **Country Level:** Network protocol type, number of connected devices, historical network operator data.
    *   **City Level:** Time of day, type of application usage (streaming, gaming, etc.), proximity to known hotspots.
    *   **Map Tile Level:** User mobility patterns, cell tower triangulation data.
*   **Data Storage:** Maintain a data structure that stores the selected granularity level and associated weighting factors for each network address.  A hierarchical tree structure could be used for efficient access and updating.
*   **API Integration:** Provide an API to query the predicted location of a network address, returning the location in the currently selected granularity.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:** A machine learning model is trained to predict the optimal granularity level based on network address characteristics and historical data. The model outputs a probability distribution over the granularity levels, and the system selects the level with the highest probability.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Selection):**

```
function select_granularity(network_address):
  // Initialize with broadest level (Country)
  current_granularity = Country

  // Get historical data (if available)
  historical_data = get_historical_data(network_address)

  // Calculate predictive power for each granularity level
  for granularity in [Country, Region, City, PostalCode, MapTile]:
    predictive_power[granularity] = calculate_predictive_power(granularity, historical_data)

  // Select granularity with highest predictive power
  best_granularity = max(predictive_power)

  // Continuous monitoring (run periodically)
  while True:
    // Recalculate predictive power
    // If predictive power of current granularity drops below threshold
    if predictive_power[current_granularity] < threshold:
      // Recalculate predictive power for all levels
      // Select new best granularity
      current_granularity = max(predictive_power)
    return current_granularity
```
