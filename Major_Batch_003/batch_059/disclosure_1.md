## Adaptive Trust Scoring with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Augment the existing multi-vendor verification system with continuous behavioral biometric analysis to dynamically adjust trust scores *during* an authenticated session, not just at login. This allows for revocation of access based on anomalous user behavior even *after* initial authentication.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection Module:**

*   **Data Streams:** Integrate data collection for:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, pressure – if hardware supports)
    *   Mouse/Touchpad movement (speed, acceleration, patterns, pressure)
    *   Scrolling behavior (speed, patterns, areas of focus)
    *   Device Orientation (if mobile – gyroscope, accelerometer data)
    *   Application Usage Patterns (sequence of apps used *within* the authenticated session)
*   **Collection Frequency:**  Data collection should occur *continuously* during the active session, but in a non-intrusive manner. Sampling rates should be adjustable based on resource constraints.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Implement noise reduction, normalization, and feature extraction algorithms on collected data streams.
*   **Data Encryption:** All collected behavioral data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

**2.  Behavioral Profile Generation Module:**

*   **Baseline Creation:**  Establish a personalized baseline profile for each user based on initial session data.  This requires a "learning period" where the system observes typical behavior.
*   **Profile Update:**  Continuously update the baseline profile using an exponential moving average to adapt to evolving user behavior.  This ensures the profile remains relevant over time.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement machine learning models (e.g., autoencoders, one-class SVMs) to detect deviations from the established baseline profile.  Models should be trained on aggregated, anonymized data to improve accuracy.
*   **Feature Weighting:**  Assign different weights to various behavioral features based on their discriminatory power and sensitivity to anomalous behavior.  This can be dynamically adjusted through feedback loops.

**3. Dynamic Trust Score Engine:**

*   **Base Trust Score:**  Initialize a trust score based on the output of the existing multi-vendor verification system (as outlined in the provided patent).
*   **Behavioral Score:** Calculate a behavioral score based on the degree of deviation from the user’s baseline profile.  Higher deviations result in lower scores.
*   **Score Integration:** Combine the base trust score and behavioral score using a weighted average. The weights should be configurable.
*   **Thresholds:** Define configurable thresholds for the combined trust score.  Falling below a threshold triggers various actions (see Action Module below).
*   **Real-Time Adjustment:** Continuously recalculate the trust score based on incoming behavioral data.

**4. Action Module:**

*   **Adaptive Authentication:** Trigger step-up authentication (e.g., MFA, out-of-wallet questions) if the trust score falls below a specified threshold.
*   **Session Restriction:**  Limit access to sensitive features or data if the trust score is low.
*   **Session Termination:**  Immediately terminate the session if the trust score falls below a critical threshold.
*   **Alerting:** Generate alerts for security administrators when anomalous behavior is detected.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Log all actions taken based on trust score changes and use this data to refine the behavioral models and thresholds.

**Pseudocode – Trust Score Calculation:**

```
function calculateTrustScore(baseScore, behavioralScore, baseWeight, behavioralWeight):
  combinedScore = (baseScore * baseWeight) + (behavioralScore * behavioralWeight)
  return combinedScore

function calculateBehavioralScore(deviation):
  // deviation is a measure of how far behavior deviates from baseline
  // scale deviation to a score between 0 (very anomalous) and 1 (normal)
  behavioralScore = 1 - (deviation / maxDeviation)  // maxDeviation is a configurable parameter
  return behavioralScore

// In the main loop:
deviation = calculateDeviationFromBaseline(currentBehaviorData)
behavioralScore = calculateBehavioralScore(deviation)
trustScore = calculateTrustScore(baseScore, behavioralScore, baseWeight, behavioralWeight)

if trustScore < threshold1:
  triggerStepUpAuthentication()
elif trustScore < threshold2:
  terminateSession()
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Standard computing infrastructure (servers, databases).
*   Machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Secure data storage and encryption mechanisms.
*   Integration with existing authentication systems.
*   Data analytics tools for monitoring and reporting.
