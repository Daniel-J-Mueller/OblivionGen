## Predictive Feature Synthesis & Dynamic Attribute Generation

**Concept:** Extend the core patent’s feature importance ranking by *creating* new features on-the-fly based on combinations of existing ones, then dynamically generating new attributes for those synthesized features based on real-time user interaction data. This moves beyond simply ranking existing features to actively evolving the feature space.

**Specs:**

**1. Feature Synthesis Module:**

*   **Input:** List of existing features (as per patent), their associated ranked attributes, and a configurable ‘synthesis depth’ (integer, default 2).
*   **Process:**
    *   Iterate through feature combinations up to the specified synthesis depth. For depth 2, this means combining pairs of features.  For depth 3, triples, etc.
    *   For each combination, apply a suite of synthesis functions (defined below).
    *   Each synthesis function generates a new feature value.
*   **Synthesis Functions:**
    *   **Additive:** `NewFeature = FeatureA + FeatureB`
    *   **Multiplicative:** `NewFeature = FeatureA * FeatureB`
    *   **Ratio:** `NewFeature = FeatureA / FeatureB` (with handling for division by zero)
    *   **Difference:** `NewFeature = |FeatureA - FeatureB|`
    *   **Conditional:** `NewFeature = IF(FeatureA > Threshold, FeatureB, 0)` (Threshold configurable)
*   **Output:** New synthesized features with initial ranked attributes (inherited and potentially modified – see Attribute Generation).

**2. Dynamic Attribute Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Synthesized features, real-time user interaction data (clicks, views, time spent, etc.), and a sliding time window (configurable).
*   **Process:**
    *   For each synthesized feature, analyze user interaction data within the sliding time window.
    *   Calculate correlations between the feature value and specific user actions.
    *   Dynamically generate new attributes for the feature based on these correlations.
*   **Attribute Generation Rules:**
    *   **Strong Positive Correlation ( > 0.7):**  `Attribute: 'HighEngagement'`
    *   **Strong Negative Correlation ( < -0.7):** `Attribute: 'LowEngagement'`
    *   **Moderate Correlation (0.3 - 0.7 or -0.3 to -0.7):** `Attribute: 'PotentialEngagement'`
    *   **No Significant Correlation:** `Attribute: 'Neutral'`
    *   Assign a 'weight' to each dynamically generated attribute based on the strength of the correlation.
*   **Output:** Enhanced feature set with dynamically generated attributes and associated weights.

**3.  Integration with Existing System:**

*   Feed the enhanced feature set into the existing predictor.
*   Allow the predictor to learn the importance of the synthesized features and dynamic attributes.
*   Continuously monitor the performance of the predictor and adjust the synthesis functions and attribute generation rules accordingly.



**Pseudocode:**

```python
def synthesize_features(feature_list, synthesis_depth):
  new_features = []
  for i in range(len(feature_list)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(feature_list)):
      if synthesis_depth > 1:
        # Apply synthesis functions (Additive, Multiplicative, etc.)
        new_feature = synthesize(feature_list[i], feature_list[j])
        new_features.append(new_feature)
  return new_features

def generate_dynamic_attributes(feature, user_interaction_data):
  correlations = calculate_correlations(feature, user_interaction_data)
  attributes = []
  for correlation, attribute_name in correlations:
    if correlation > 0.7:
      attributes.append(("HighEngagement", correlation))
    elif correlation < -0.7:
      attributes.append(("LowEngagement", correlation))
    elif abs(correlation) >= 0.3:
      attributes.append(("PotentialEngagement", correlation))
    else:
      attributes.append(("Neutral", 0))
  return attributes
```
