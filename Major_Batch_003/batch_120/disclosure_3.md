## Adaptive Precision Polynomial Approximation

**Concept:** Extend the polynomial approximation technique to dynamically adjust the precision (degree) of the polynomial used *within* each subinterval, based on real-time error feedback during operation. This moves beyond static configuration to a runtime-optimized solution.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** A small, dedicated co-processor integrated with the existing hardware accelerator. This co-processor handles the adaptive precision calculation and polynomial evaluation.
*   **Memory:**  A dedicated buffer within the co-processor to store multiple polynomial coefficient sets *per subinterval*, each representing a different precision level (e.g., degree 2, degree 3, degree 4 polynomials).  The size of this buffer will dictate the maximum achievable adaptive range.
*   **Error Metric:** An integrated error monitor continuously calculates the difference between the non-linear function’s true output and the polynomial approximation’s output. This could be a simple absolute difference or a more complex metric like mean squared error. The error monitor operates *concurrently* with the polynomial evaluation.
*   **Precision Control Logic:** The core of the adaptive system. This logic monitors the error metric and dynamically selects the appropriate polynomial coefficient set for each subinterval.
    *   **Thresholds:** Configurable error thresholds for each subinterval. If the error exceeds the threshold, the precision level is *increased* (using a higher-degree polynomial) until the error falls below the threshold. If the error is consistently *below* a lower threshold, the precision level is *decreased* to reduce computation.
    *   **Hysteresis:** Incorporate hysteresis to prevent oscillations between precision levels.
    *   **Granularity:** Configurable precision step size (e.g., increase/decrease polynomial degree by 1).
*   **Lookup Table Enhancement:** The existing index and main lookup tables are extended to include a 'precision level' field associated with each subinterval configuration.
*   **Runtime Configuration:** A dedicated register set allows the system to configure:
    *   Initial precision levels per subinterval.
    *   Error thresholds for each subinterval.
    *   Hysteresis values.
    *   Precision step size.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Per Subinterval:
error = CalculateError(nonLinearFunction(x), PolynomialApprox(x, coefficients));

if (error > highThreshold) {
  precisionLevel = min(maxPrecision, precisionLevel + 1); // Increase precision
} else if (error < lowThreshold) {
  precisionLevel = max(minPrecision, precisionLevel - 1); // Decrease precision
}

coefficients = LookupCoefficients(subintervalID, precisionLevel);

result = EvaluatePolynomial(x, coefficients);
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond static pre-configuration to *dynamic* optimization during runtime. It allows the hardware accelerator to adapt to varying input conditions and achieve a better balance between accuracy and computational cost. This is especially beneficial for applications where input data distributions are non-stationary or unpredictable. The system essentially self-tunes to minimize error while maximizing efficiency.
