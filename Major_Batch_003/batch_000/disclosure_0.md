**Personalized Prefetching with Emotional State Analysis**

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate with client device sensors (camera, microphone, accelerometer). Optional wearable integration for more robust data.
*   **Emotional AI Module:**  Real-time analysis of user's emotional state. Utilize facial expression recognition, voice tone analysis, and movement patterns to determine mood (happy, sad, frustrated, focused, etc.).  Output a continuous emotional state vector.
*   **Content Categorization:**  Maintain a database categorizing content items (URLs) based on emotional impact (uplifting, calming, thought-provoking, stimulating, neutral). Categorization performed via AI analysis of content and crowd-sourced user feedback.
*   **Prefetching Logic:**
    *   **Baseline:** Utilize existing patent's prefetch likelihood calculations (past interactions, device characteristics).
    *   **Emotional Adjustment:** Modify prefetch likelihood based on emotional state and content category.
        *   **Positive Emotion/Uplifting Content:** Increase prefetch likelihood significantly.
        *   **Negative Emotion/Calming Content:** Increase prefetch likelihood moderately.
        *   **Negative Emotion/Stimulating Content:** Decrease prefetch likelihood.
        *   **Focused Emotion/Neutral Content:** Maintain baseline likelihood.
    *   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adjust prefetch thresholds dynamically based on user's sustained emotional state. A user consistently experiencing frustration may require a higher threshold for prefetching potentially irritating content.
*   **User Control:** Provide a user interface for adjusting the sensitivity of emotional prefetching and for opting out of the feature entirely.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** All emotional analysis performed on-device to minimize data transmission and enhance user privacy. Data used solely for prefetching optimization and never shared with third parties.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** Implement a robust A/B testing framework to continuously refine emotional prefetching algorithms and optimize user engagement.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Function: CalculatePrefetchLikelihood
// Input: ContentItem, UserEmotionalState, DeviceCharacteristics
// Output: PrefetchLikelihood (0.0 - 1.0)

PrefetchLikelihood = BaselineLikelihood(ContentItem, DeviceCharacteristics)

EmotionalStateVector = AnalyzeEmotionalState(User)

ContentEmotionalCategory = GetContentEmotionalCategory(ContentItem)

// Apply emotional adjustment
If (EmotionalStateVector.Happiness > ThresholdHappiness) AND (ContentEmotionalCategory == "Uplifting") Then
    PrefetchLikelihood = PrefetchLikelihood * EmotionalBoostFactorHigh
Else If (EmotionalStateVector.Sadness > ThresholdSadness) AND (ContentEmotionalCategory == "Calming") Then
    PrefetchLikelihood = PrefetchLikelihood * EmotionalBoostFactorMedium
Else If (EmotionalStateVector.Frustration > ThresholdFrustration) AND (ContentEmotionalCategory == "Stimulating") Then
    PrefetchLikelihood = PrefetchLikelihood * EmotionalReductionFactor
End If

// Adjust for sustained emotional states
If (User.SustainedFrustration > SustainedFrustrationThreshold) Then
    PrefetchThreshold = PrefetchThreshold * FrustrationAdjustmentFactor
End If

Return PrefetchLikelihood
```

**Rationale:** The original patent focuses on behavioral prediction. This adaptation seeks to incorporate emotional understanding for more nuanced and empathetic prefetching, increasing user satisfaction and reducing potential irritation. It goes beyond *what* the user does and attempts to anticipate *how* the user feels.
