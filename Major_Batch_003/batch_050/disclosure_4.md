## Dynamic Temporal Preference Profiling & Predictive Proximity Alerts

**Concept:** Expand upon the patent’s location affinity prediction by layering in real-time proximity alerts triggered by *predicted* future preferences, rather than solely historical or current behavior. This moves beyond suggesting places someone *might* like to proactively notifying them when a predicted preference is within range.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Feature Engineering:**

*   **Expanded Training Data:** Augment user action data with publicly available event schedules (concerts, festivals, sports games, conferences), weather forecasts, and real-time local news feeds (opening of new restaurants, temporary art installations).
*   **Temporal Feature Extraction:** Extract features representing time-based preferences. Examples: “user consistently visits coffee shops between 8-9 am”, “user frequently attends outdoor concerts in July”, “user prefers museums on rainy days”.  Represent these as time-series vectors.
*   **Demographic Layer:** Include demographic data (age, income, interests – inferred or explicit) to refine temporal preference profiles.
*    **Proximity Thresholds:** Allow users to define customizable proximity thresholds (e.g., "Notify me when a jazz club I might like is within 500 meters").

**2. Predictive Modeling:**

*   **Hybrid Model:** Employ a hybrid model combining Collaborative Filtering (as in the patent) with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically, an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network.
*   **LSTM for Temporal Preference:** Train the LSTM on the time-series data to predict future preferences – "What is the probability this user will be interested in X at time T?".
*   **Probability Score:**  Output a probability score indicating the likelihood of a user being interested in a specific location/event at a future time.
*   **Latent Property Mapping:** Utilize latent property extraction (mentioned in the patent) to map predicted preferences to specific location attributes (e.g., “user likely wants a quiet cafe with free Wi-Fi”).

**3. Proximity Alert System:**

*   **Real-time Location Tracking:** Utilize user's device location data (with explicit permission).
*   **Geofencing:**  Implement geofencing around potential locations.
*   **Proximity Calculation:** Calculate the distance between the user and relevant geofenced locations.
*   **Alert Triggering:**  If the distance is within the user-defined threshold *and* the predicted preference probability exceeds a certain level (tunable parameter), trigger an alert.
*   **Alert Customization:** Allow users to customize alert content (e.g., “New jazz club opening nearby – you might like it!”, "Your predicted preference for Italian food is nearby!")

**4. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
// Main Loop (executed on server)
For Each User:
    Get User's Current Location
    Predict User's Future Preferences (using LSTM)
    For Each Predicted Preference:
        Find Nearby Locations Matching Preference
        If Distance(User, Location) <= User's Proximity Threshold AND
           Prediction Probability > Alert Threshold:
            Send Alert to User
```

**5. Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   **Server:** Cloud-based infrastructure for model training, data storage, and alert processing.
*   **Client App:** Mobile app (iOS/Android) for location tracking, user preferences, and alert display.
*   **Data Sources:** APIs for event schedules, weather forecasts, local news, and mapping services.
*   **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow or PyTorch.
*   **Database:** Scalable NoSQL database (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) for storing user data and prediction results.
