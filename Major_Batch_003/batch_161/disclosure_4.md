## Dynamic Iconography – Environmental Awareness Layer

**Concept:** A display screen GUI element incorporating real-time environmental data into icon appearance and behavior. Icons aren't static; they *react* to conditions.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:**  System accesses public APIs for:
    *   Air Quality Index (AQI) – particulate matter, ozone, etc. (local to user location)
    *   UV Index
    *   Noise Pollution (dB levels – sourced from user-contributed data or public sensors)
    *   Weather (temperature, humidity, wind speed)

2.  **Icon Mapping:**  A pre-defined mapping system links environmental parameters to visual icon modifications. Examples:
    *   **AQI:**  Icon color shifts from green (good) to red (hazardous).  Animated ‘smog’ effect around icons during high pollution.
    *   **UV Index:** Icon “glow” intensity increases with UV index.  An animated “sunscreen” layer appears over relevant icons (e.g., outdoor activity apps).
    *   **Noise Pollution:** Icon subtly vibrates/pulses proportional to dB level.  A visual ‘sound wave’ emanates from the icon.
    *   **Temperature:**  Icon “frosts over” at low temperatures.  “Heat haze” effect at high temperatures.

3.  **Icon Categories:** Different icon categories react differently to data.
    *   **Health/Fitness:** Focus on AQI, UV index. Icons representing outdoor activity (running, cycling) prominently display warnings.
    *   **Communication:**  Subtle reactions, perhaps a color shift indicating general environmental quality.
    *   **Productivity:** Minimal reactions, perhaps a slight opacity change.

4.  **User Customization:**
    *   **Sensitivity Levels:** User can adjust how strongly icons react to environmental data.
    *   **Data Sources:** User can prioritize/select data sources (e.g., prefer data from a specific air quality sensor).
    *   **Icon Categories:** User can enable/disable reactions for specific icon categories.

5.  **Pseudocode (Icon Update Loop):**

```
FOR EACH icon IN iconList:
    airQuality = getAirQuality(userLocation)
    uvIndex = getUVIndex(userLocation)
    noiseLevel = getNoiseLevel(userLocation)
    temperature = getTemperature(userLocation)

    icon.color = mapAirQualityToColor(airQuality)
    icon.glow = mapUVIndexToGlow(uvIndex)
    icon.vibration = mapNoiseLevelToVibration(noiseLevel)

    IF temperature < 0:
        icon.applyFrostEffect()
    ELSE IF temperature > 30:
        icon.applyHeatHazeEffect()

    icon.updateDisplay()
END FOR
```

6. **Animation Library:**  A library of pre-built animation effects (frost, heat haze, smog, glow, vibration) to be applied to icons. These should be modular and customizable (color, intensity, speed).

7. **Performance Considerations:**  Optimization to avoid excessive CPU/GPU usage.  Caching of environmental data.  Optional "low-power" mode with reduced animation frequency.
