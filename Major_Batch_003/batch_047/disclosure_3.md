## Personalized Music Video Remixing & Interactive Generation

**Concept:** Extend the "save" functionality beyond simply adding a full-length video to a watch list. Integrate interactive remixing tools *within* the preview experience.

**Specs:**

1.  **Remix Interface Integration:** Upon selecting the "save" element (or a newly added "remix" element), instead of immediately adding to a watch list, present a simplified, in-app remix interface layered *over* the current preview segment.

2.  **Core Remix Tools:**
    *   **Segment Looping/Extension:** Allow users to specify a preferred loop point within the current preview segment, or extend the duration of a particular visual/musical phrase.
    *   **Effect Filters:** Provide a limited selection of visual effects (color tint, glitch, blur) and audio effects (EQ adjustments, reverb, delay) that users can apply to the current segment.
    *   **Transition Selection:** Offer a small library of basic transitions (fade, wipe, cross-dissolve) that can be applied to the beginning/end of the current segment.
    *   **Speed Adjustment:** Allow users to adjust the playback speed (0.5x - 2.0x) of the preview segment.

3.  **Remix Composition Timeline:** A simplified, horizontal timeline displays the currently remixed segments.  Users can add/remove segments, re-order them, and adjust transition points. Initial timeline length is limited (e.g., 30-60 seconds) to encourage brevity.

4.  **AI-Assisted Beat Matching & Synchronization:**  An AI engine analyzes the audio of the selected preview segment and the user’s remix edits.  It automatically attempts to beat-match transitions, synchronize visual effects to the music, and maintain a consistent tempo.  The user can override AI suggestions.

5.  **Social Sharing & Collaboration:**
    *   **Remix Sharing:** Users can share their short remixes directly to their social feed (integrated with the existing platform).
    *   **Remix Duets:**  Allow users to "duet" with existing remixes – adding their own segments or modifications on top of another user’s creation.
    *   **Remix Challenges:**  Introduce themed remix challenges, encouraging users to create remixes based on specific prompts or criteria.

6.  **AI-Generated Expansion:**  If a user demonstrates consistent remixing behavior, the system can *automatically* generate longer-form remixes from their saved segments, combining them with AI-generated music and visuals to create full-length music videos.

**Pseudocode (AI-Generated Expansion):**

```
function generate_full_video(user_remix_segments, user_remix_history) {
  // Analyze user's remix style (tempo, effect preferences, segment selection)
  style_profile = analyze_remix_style(user_remix_history);

  // Generate AI music based on style_profile and segment audio analysis
  ai_music = generate_music(style_profile, segment_audio_analysis);

  // Generate AI visuals (using style transfer or procedural generation)
  ai_visuals = generate_visuals(style_profile, segment_visuals);

  // Assemble full-length video:
  // - Interleave user's segments with AI-generated content
  // - Use transitions based on user's preferences and style profile
  full_video = assemble_video(user_segments, ai_music, ai_visuals);

  return full_video;
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Mobile app (iOS/Android) with video editing capabilities
*   Cloud-based AI engine for music and visual generation
*   Robust video compression and streaming infrastructure.
*   Sufficient processing power to run the remix interface smoothly on mobile devices.
