## Dynamic Narrative Stitching with Predictive Engagement

**Concept:** Expand beyond segment selection to *dynamically stitch* video segments together, not just based on past engagement, but *predictive* engagement modeled from user behavior and contextual data. This shifts from reactive editing to *proactive* narrative construction.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Engagement Model:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   User viewing history (granular – timestamps, watch duration, skipped segments).
    *   User search queries (related to video categories/tags).
    *   User social media activity (publicly available data – likes, shares, comments – filtered for relevance).
    *   Contextual data: time of day, day of week, location (if permitted), device type.
    *   Real-time engagement data from *other* viewers (anonymized).
*   **Model Type:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to capture temporal dependencies.
*   **Output:** A probability distribution over possible segment transitions.  For each segment, the model predicts the likelihood of transitioning to *any other* segment.  This isn't just “this segment is popular,” but “given the current segment and user state, what is the probability the user will continue watching *this other* segment?”.

**2. Dynamic Stitching Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Video segments (pre-segmented based on categorization from the base patent), Predictive Engagement Model output.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Start with an initial segment (based on user preference or current trend).
    2.  For each subsequent segment selection:
        *   Query the Predictive Engagement Model with the current segment and user state.
        *   Rank candidate segments based on predicted engagement probability.
        *   Introduce a ‘novelty’ factor: randomly select a lower-ranked segment with a small probability (to prevent overly predictable narratives). The probability of selecting this segment can be weighted based on user’s expressed desire for variety (determined from previous viewing choices)
        *   If the current segment is nearing the desired video length, prioritize segments with a high ‘completion’ probability (segments likely to lead to the user finishing the video).
        *   Perform a 'coherence check': ensure the chosen segments make logical sense in sequence. A simple rule-based system can assess topic similarity and scene transitions. If the coherence score falls below a threshold, reject the segment.
    3.  Repeat step 2 until the desired video length is reached or the available segments are exhausted.

**3.  User Feedback Loop:**

*   Real-time monitoring of user engagement (watch duration, skip rate, etc.).
*   Continuous retraining of the Predictive Engagement Model using this feedback.
*   A/B testing of different stitching strategies (e.g., varying the novelty factor) to optimize performance.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def stitch_video(user_state, desired_length, segments):
  current_segment = select_initial_segment(user_state, segments)
  stitched_video = [current_segment]
  total_duration = duration(current_segment)

  while total_duration < desired_length and segments:
    probabilities = predict_engagement(user_state, current_segment, segments)
    ranked_segments = sort_segments_by_probability(probabilities)

    # Apply Novelty Factor (example)
    if random.random() < novelty_factor:
      candidate_segment = random.choice(segments) # random
    else:
      candidate_segment = ranked_segments[0] # highest probability

    if coherence_check(current_segment, candidate_segment):
      stitched_video.append(candidate_segment)
      total_duration += duration(candidate_segment)
      current_segment = candidate_segment
      segments.remove(candidate_segment)
    else:
        # Skip this segment
        pass
  return stitched_video
```

**Expansion:**  Integrate with generative AI.  If a smooth transition between segments is impossible, *generate* a short bridging segment (using text-to-video or similar techniques) to create a cohesive narrative. This would require a trained model capable of generating contextually relevant content.
