**Dynamic Spatial Audio & Avatar Integration for Meetings**

**Concept:** Expand upon the existing system’s ability to prioritize audio feeds by introducing spatial audio based on avatar positioning within a virtual meeting space, combined with AI-driven emotional state mirroring via avatar animation.

**Specs:**

1.  **Virtual Space Mapping:**
    *   System supports creation/import of 3D meeting spaces (rooms, outdoor settings, etc.).  Can be pre-defined or user-created with basic modeling tools.
    *   Each participant is represented by a customizable avatar within the space.  Avatar positioning is tracked via standard webcam/VR input (or manually assigned).
    *   Spatial audio engine calculates sound attenuation and directionality based on avatar proximity and orientation. (e.g., a speaker to your avatar's left is heard primarily in the left ear).

2.  **AI-Driven Emotional State Mirroring:**
    *   Real-time facial expression analysis (via webcam) of each participant.
    *   AI model maps facial expressions to emotional states (happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.).
    *   Avatar animation system subtly mirrors the detected emotional state of the speaker onto their avatar *for all other participants*.  (e.g., a slight smile, a furrowed brow). Intensity is adjustable.  Option to disable.
    *   Emphasis on *subtle* mirroring – goal is to enhance empathy and understanding, not create uncanny valley effects.

3.  **Audio Feed Prioritization & Mixing:**
    *   Existing attenuation factors are integrated with the spatial audio engine.
    *   Audio mixer dynamically adjusts volume and panning of each participant's audio feed based on:
        *   Proximity to the active speaker's avatar
        *   Existing conversation status (active conversation = higher priority)
        *   Emotional state mirroring (e.g. if an avatar is exhibiting signs of distress, their audio might be subtly boosted)

4.  **Pseudocode - Audio Mixing:**

```
function mixAudio(participantData[], activeSpeakerData, emotionalStateData) {
  for each participant in participantData {
    // Base Volume
    volume = participant.baseVolume;

    // Distance Attenuation
    distance = calculateDistance(activeSpeakerData.avatarPosition, participant.avatarPosition);
    volume -= distanceAttenuationCurve(distance);

    // Conversation Status
    if (participant is in active conversation with activeSpeaker) {
      volume *= conversationBoostFactor;
    }

    // Emotional State Boost/Reduction
    emotionalState = emotionalStateData[participant];
    if (emotionalState is "distress") {
      volume *= distressBoostFactor;
    }
    if (emotionalState is "anger") {
      volume *= angerReductionFactor; // Subtle reduction to prevent escalation
    }

    // Spatial Panning
    pan = calculatePan(activeSpeakerData.avatarPosition, participant.avatarPosition);
    applyPan(participant.audioFeed, pan);

    // Apply Final Volume
    applyVolume(participant.audioFeed, volume);
  }
}
```

5.  **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Standard webcam and microphone.
    *   Optional: VR headset/tracking for more accurate avatar positioning.
    *   Sufficient processing power for real-time facial expression analysis and spatial audio rendering.

6.  **Software Requirements:**
    *   Facial expression recognition library (e.g., OpenCV, Affectiva).
    *   Spatial audio engine (e.g., Steam Audio, Resonance Audio).
    *   3D rendering engine (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine).
