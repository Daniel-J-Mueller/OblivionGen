## Dynamic Annotation ‘Heatmaps’ & Predictive Restriction

**Concept:** Extend the system to visually represent annotation ‘risk’ across a network *before* restrictions are applied, predicting potential guideline violations based on real-time content analysis and user behavior. This moves from reactive restriction to proactive moderation assistance.

**Specs:**

**1. Real-Time ‘Heatmap’ Generation:**

*   **Data Input:** Continuously ingest data from:
    *   User reports (as per the patent)
    *   Content engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments – frequency & sentiment)
    *   AI-driven content analysis (image/video object detection, text sentiment, toxicity scoring - external API integration)
    *   Moderation logs (deleted content, user bans linked to annotations)
*   **Data Processing:**
    *   Assign ‘risk scores’ to annotations based on weighted averages of input data. Weights configurable via admin interface.
    *   Normalize risk scores across the network.
    *   Geospatial mapping: Assign risk scores to geographic locations based on content origin.
*   **Visualization:**
    *   Display a dynamic heatmap overlay on a network visualization (e.g., a global map or user network graph).
    *   Color-coding: Risk levels represented by a gradient (green = low risk, yellow = moderate, red = high).
    *   Interactive features:
        *   Zoom/pan for detailed analysis.
        *   Filtering: Display annotations based on risk level, keywords, or geographic location.
        *   Clickable annotations: Display associated content samples and risk score breakdown.

**2. Predictive Restriction Engine:**

*   **Thresholds:** Admin-configurable thresholds for each risk level.
*   **Automated Restriction Suggestions:** Based on risk score and threshold:
    *   *Warning Level*: Flag the annotation for manual review (as per patent).
    *   *Moderate Level*:  Limit the visibility of content with the annotation (e.g., reduced ranking in feeds, requiring a content warning).
    *   *High Level*: Temporarily block the annotation.
*   **‘Ripple Effect’ Analysis:** When a restriction is applied, analyze the network to identify related annotations that may also be at risk. Suggest preemptive restrictions.
*   **User Behavior Profiling:** Track user interactions with restricted annotations.  Identify users repeatedly engaging with problematic content.  Implement individualized restrictions (e.g., temporary shadow banning).

**3. Admin Interface Enhancements:**

*   **Heatmap Dashboard:** Centralized view of network-wide annotation risk.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Automated alerts for sudden spikes in risk scores or unusual patterns of activity.
*   **‘What-If’ Scenario Planning:**  Simulate the impact of applying different restrictions on the network.
*   **Detailed Reporting:** Track restriction effectiveness, identify emerging trends, and refine risk scoring algorithms.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Restriction Engine):**

```
function predictRestriction(annotation, riskScore) {
  if (riskScore > HIGH_THRESHOLD) {
    blockAnnotation(annotation);
    rippleEffectAnalysis(annotation);
  } else if (riskScore > MODERATE_THRESHOLD) {
    limitVisibility(annotation);
  } else if (riskScore > WARNING_THRESHOLD) {
    flagForManualReview(annotation);
  }
}

function rippleEffectAnalysis(annotation) {
  relatedAnnotations = findRelatedAnnotations(annotation);
  for each relatedAnnotation in relatedAnnotations {
    if (getRiskScore(relatedAnnotation) > WARNING_THRESHOLD) {
      suggestRestriction(relatedAnnotation);
    }
  }
}
```
