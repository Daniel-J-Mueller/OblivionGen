## Dynamic Overlay ‘Echoes’ - Procedural Animation & User Interaction

**Concept:** Extend dynamic overlays beyond static or pre-defined animations by allowing user-defined ‘trigger’ events *within* the video to initiate procedural animations within the overlay. Think of it as creating reactive, interactive overlays that ‘echo’ actions or sounds within the source video.

**Specifications:**

**1. Trigger Definition Module (Client-Side):**

*   **Input:** Source video, User-defined trigger criteria.
*   **Trigger Types:**
    *   **Audio Peak Detection:** Detects specific decibel levels or frequency ranges.
    *   **Motion Vector Analysis:** Identifies areas of significant motion within the video frame.
    *   **Color Change Detection:** Monitors specific pixels or regions for color shifts.
    *   **Object Recognition (Optional):** Utilizes basic object recognition to trigger events based on identified objects (e.g., a ball, a face).
*   **Output:** A ‘trigger event stream’ - a time-stamped list of events that occurred within the video.

**2. Procedural Animation Engine (Client-Side/Server-Side):**

*   **Input:** Trigger event stream, User-defined procedural animation ‘recipes’.
*   **Animation Recipes:** These are node-based graphs defining how the overlay should react to specific trigger events. Nodes can include:
    *   **Particle Systems:** Emit particles based on trigger location and intensity.
    *   **Shape Morphing:** Dynamically alter the shape of overlay elements.
    *   **Color Cycling:** Change overlay colors based on trigger frequency.
    *   **Text Generation:** Display text based on trigger events.
    *   **Sound Synthesis:** Generate short sound effects based on triggers.
*   **Output:** A dynamically generated overlay animation sequence.

**3. Overlay Transmission & Rendering (Server-Side/Client-Side):**

*   **Overlay Format:** Transmit overlay animations as a sequence of vector graphics or lightweight video segments.  Consider using a codec optimized for procedural content.
*   **Synchronization:** Precisely synchronize the overlay animation with the source video.  Time-stamping and frame-accurate alignment are crucial.
*   **Rendering:**  Render the overlay on top of the source video in real-time.  Efficient GPU acceleration is recommended.



**Pseudocode (Client-Side - Trigger Definition):**

```
function analyzeVideo(videoPath, triggerType, parameters) {
  video = loadVideo(videoPath);
  frameRate = getVideoFrameRate(video);
  triggers = [];

  for (frame in video) {
    if (triggerType == "audioPeak") {
      audioLevel = getAudioLevel(frame);
      if (audioLevel > parameters.threshold) {
        triggers.push({ time: frame.timestamp, type: "audioPeak", level: audioLevel });
      }
    } else if (triggerType == "motionVectors") {
      motionVectors = getMotionVectors(frame);
      if (motionVectors.length > parameters.threshold) {
        triggers.push({ time: frame.timestamp, type: "motion", intensity: motionVectors.length });
      }
    }
  }

  return triggers;
}
```

**Innovation:** The system moves beyond pre-rendered overlays to dynamically generate animation based on video *content* and user interaction, creating a far more immersive and interactive experience. This creates 'living' overlays that feel reactive and organic.
