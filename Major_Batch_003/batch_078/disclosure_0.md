**Dynamic Focus Array with Micro-Lens Steering**

**Concept:** Expand the dynamic range and spatial resolution beyond the linear array by incorporating a micro-lens array *above* the pixel array, coupled with dynamic lens steering to focus light onto specific pixels or groups of pixels. This moves beyond simply *detecting* saturation, and actively *controls* where light is directed for higher fidelity data capture.

**Specs:**

*   **Pixel Array:** Existing CMOS pixel array as defined in the provided patent (baseline).
*   **Micro-Lens Array (MLA):**  Array of individually addressable micro-lenses positioned directly above the pixel array. Lens pitch matching the pixel pitch. Lens material: polymer with high refractive index.
*   **Actuation Mechanism:**  Electrostatic actuation via micro-fabricated electrodes beneath each micro-lens. This allows for tilting and potentially minor deformation of each lens. Range of motion: +/- 5 degrees tilt.
*   **Control System:** FPGA-based system for real-time control of the MLA. Requires a calibration routine to map lens position to pixel coordinates.
*   **Illumination Source:** Existing optical fibers (as in patent) but capable of pulsed illumination.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Existing pixel scanner hardware, modified to handle potential increased data rate due to dynamic focusing.

**Operation:**

1.  **Calibration:** Initial calibration maps each micro-lens to a corresponding pixel or small group of pixels.
2.  **Illumination & Steering:**  Optical fibers emit a short pulse of light. The control system dynamically steers the micro-lenses to focus the light onto a specific region of interest.  This allows for 'virtual pixels' with increased effective size, or sub-pixel resolution.
3.  **Sequential Capture:**  The pixel scanner captures the image data.  The control system sequentially steers the micro-lenses to scan across the region of interest, effectively building up a higher-resolution image.
4.  **Saturation Control:** The dynamic steering enables precise control of light intensity at the pixel level. Saturation can be actively *avoided* in areas where it would hinder data capture, or *intentionally induced* for specific signal enhancement.
5.  **Data Processing:** Raw data is processed to reconstruct the final image, accounting for the dynamic lens steering and potential distortions.

**Pseudocode (Control System):**

```
// Calibration Routine (executed once)
mapLensToPixel(lensID, pixelX, pixelY) // Store lens-pixel mapping

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Receive region of interest coordinates (ROI_x, ROI_y, ROI_width, ROI_height)
    
    for (x = ROI_x; x < ROI_x + ROI_width; x++) {
        for (y = ROI_y; y < ROI_y + ROI_height; y++) {
            // Determine corresponding lens for pixel (x, y)
            lensID = findLensForPixel(x, y)
            
            // Calculate lens tilt angle based on desired focus point (x, y)
            angle = calculateTiltAngle(lensID, x, y)
            
            // Apply voltage to electrostatic actuators to set lens angle
            setLensAngle(lensID, angle)
            
            // Trigger pixel scanner to capture data for pixel (x, y)
            capturePixelData(x, y)
        }
    }
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Wavelength Selective Micro-Lenses:** Incorporate micro-lenses with wavelength-dependent focusing properties for spectral imaging.
*   **Adaptive Optics:** Implement an adaptive optics system to correct for aberrations and improve image quality.
*   **Holographic Steering:** Replace the electrostatic actuators with a holographic steering system for more precise and complex light control.
