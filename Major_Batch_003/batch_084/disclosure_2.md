## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Mapping via Predictive Sensor Fusion

**Concept:** Extend the existing pose modeling to actively *shape* haptic feedback delivered to the user based on predicted sensor data and environmental context. Instead of solely correcting pose for visual rendering, the system will proactively modify haptic sensations to *feel* more realistic, even during sensor dropouts or saturation.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Haptic Device Integration:** The system integrates with advanced haptic feedback devices (gloves, suits, localized actuators) capable of delivering nuanced force, texture, and thermal sensations.

2.  **Environmental Mapping:** A pre-populated or dynamically generated environmental map stores physical properties (density, friction, temperature) of virtual objects.

3.  **Predictive Force Modeling:**
    *   The existing piecewise linear fit algorithm is expanded to *predict not just pose, but also contact forces*.
    *   When a sensor correction region is identified, the system extrapolates predicted forces based on adjacent sensor readings *and* the environmental map.
    *   Pseudocode:

        ```
        FUNCTION PredictForce(sensorData, correctionRegion, environmentalMap)
        {
          //Identify adjacent sensor readings
          adjacentReadings = GetAdjacentReadings(sensorData, correctionRegion)

          //Determine slope based on adjacent readings
          slope = CalculateSlope(adjacentReadings)

          //Extrapolate force using slope and environmental properties
          predictedForce = slope * distanceToContactPoint + environmentalMap.friction * forceMagnitude

          RETURN predictedForce
        }
        ```

4.  **Haptic Blending:** A ‘haptic blending’ algorithm combines:
    *   *Real-time sensor data:*  Haptic feedback directly driven by valid sensor input.
    *   *Predicted haptic data:*  Haptic feedback generated from the predicted force model during correction regions.
    *   *Contextual haptic data:* Pre-defined haptic profiles associated with object types (e.g., smooth glass, rough wood).

    The blending weights are dynamically adjusted based on sensor data reliability.

5.  **Adaptive Filtering:** Implement a Kalman filter to smooth the blended haptic signal, reducing jitter and ensuring a consistent user experience.

6.  **User Profile Customization:** Allow users to adjust haptic intensity, texture preferences, and responsiveness.

7.  **Sensor Fusion Enhancement:** Integrate data from additional sensors (e.g., EMG, skin conductance) to refine the predictive model and provide more accurate haptic feedback. For example, muscle tension detected via EMG could anticipate a grasp, enabling pre-emptive haptic preparation.

8.  **Thermal Haptic Layer**: Introduce a thermal haptic layer synchronized with visual and force feedback. Predictive modeling extrapolates surface temperatures during sensor gaps. This uses the same predictive piecewise linear algorithm, but instead predicts temperature gradients.
