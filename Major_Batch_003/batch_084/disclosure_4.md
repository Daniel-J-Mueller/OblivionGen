## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Predictive Action

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:**  Acoustic Reconstruction Engine (ARE) – software module executing on dedicated hardware (DSP or FPGA preferred).
*   **Input:** Ambient audio stream (from microphone array – minimum 4 elements, optimized for spatial awareness), Reference Audio Signal (as per source patent).
*   **Output:**  3D acoustic scene map (point cloud representation), Predicted Action probability vector.
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Microphone array (4+ elements), Audio processing unit (DSP/FPGA), System RAM (minimum 8GB), Storage (SSD preferred - 256GB minimum), Network Connectivity (Wi-Fi/Ethernet).

**Innovation Description:**

Instead of *detecting* a state, we *reconstruct* the acoustic environment. The system doesn't just check for the reference signal; it builds a model of the room's soundscape *including* the reference signal as a key landmark. 

1.  **Spatial Audio Mapping:** The microphone array captures ambient sound. The ARE performs beamforming and time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) calculations to pinpoint sound source locations in 3D space. This generates a dynamic point cloud map of the acoustic environment.
2.  **Reference Signal Localization:** The system actively searches for the reference audio signal *within* the reconstructed acoustic map. Successfully locating the reference signal provides a fixed point for calibration and contextualization.
3.  **Sound Event Classification:**  The system employs a trained AI model (CNN/RNN) to identify other sound events within the acoustic map (speech, music, mechanical sounds, etc.).  The AI model leverages the reference signal's location as a grounding point for spatial audio classification.
4.  **Predictive Action Engine:** The system maintains a database of “action signatures” – acoustic patterns associated with specific actions (e.g., “channel up,” “volume increase,” “menu navigation”). Using the classified sound events and the reference signal’s presence, the Predictive Action Engine calculates the probability of each action being performed.
5.  **Dynamic Thresholding:** Similarity thresholds are *not* fixed. They dynamically adjust based on ambient noise levels and the confidence level of the sound event classification. This reduces false positives and improves accuracy in noisy environments.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
ARE = AcousticReconstructionEngine()
AIModel = SoundEventClassificationModel()
ActionSignatureDB = LoadActionSignatures()

// Main Loop
while (True) {
    AmbientAudio = CaptureAudio()
    AcousticMap = ARE.ReconstructScene(AmbientAudio)
    ReferenceSignalLocation = ARE.LocateSignal(AcousticMap, ReferenceAudioSignal)

    if (ReferenceSignalLocation != null) {
        SoundEvents = AIModel.ClassifyEvents(AcousticMap, ReferenceSignalLocation)
        ActionProbabilities = CalculateActionProbabilities(SoundEvents, ActionSignatureDB)

        // Determine most likely action
        MostLikelyAction = FindMaxProbability(ActionProbabilities)

        // Initiate action (e.g., send command to device)
        InitiateAction(MostLikelyAction)
    }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Proactive remote control functionality (anticipate user actions).
*   Enhanced voice assistant responsiveness.
*   Smart home automation based on acoustic context.
*   Acoustic environment monitoring and analysis.
*   Adaptive audio equalization based on room acoustics and sound events.
