## Adaptive Task Decomposition & Proactive Suggestion System

**Concept:** Extend the suspended task functionality by proactively *decomposing* complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks *before* the user explicitly requests it, and offering these sub-tasks as suggestions based on predicted user intent and available resources.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Task Decomposition Engine:** A rule-based and ML-driven system capable of analyzing a suspended task's dialog history and identifying opportunities to break it down.  Rules might include keyword detection ("book flight and hotel"), task complexity metrics (number of required API calls), and historical user behavior. ML models (e.g., sequence-to-sequence) could learn to predict optimal decomposition strategies.
*   **Resource Availability Monitor:** Tracks available resources (e.g., API access, data sources, computing power) that are relevant to potential sub-tasks.
*   **Intent Prediction Module:**  Analyzes current user input (speech or text) *before* a full request is formed, attempting to predict the user’s immediate goal. Uses the dialog history of suspended tasks as context.
*   **Suggestion Engine:**  Combines Intent Prediction, Task Decomposition, and Resource Availability to generate a ranked list of suggested sub-tasks.
*   **User Interface Adaptation Module:** Dynamically adjusts the UI to present sub-task suggestions in a clear and actionable format (e.g., buttons, cards, voice prompts).

**II. Workflow:**

1.  **Suspended Task Monitoring:** The system continuously monitors suspended tasks.
2.  **Proactive Decomposition:** For each suspended task, the Task Decomposition Engine attempts to identify potential sub-tasks.
3.  **Intent Prediction:** The Intent Prediction Module analyzes current user input.
4.  **Suggestion Generation:** The Suggestion Engine combines intent prediction with the list of potential sub-tasks and resource availability to create a ranked list of suggestions.
5.  **UI Presentation:** The UI Adaptation Module presents the top suggestions to the user.
6.  **User Selection:** The user selects a suggested sub-task.
7.  **Sub-task Execution:** The system executes the selected sub-task, updating the overall suspended task state.  A seamless transition should occur without requiring the user to re-specify the overall goal.

**III. Pseudocode (Suggestion Engine):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateSuggestions(suspendedTask, userInput):
  // 1. Get potential sub-tasks from Task Decomposition Engine
  subTasks = TaskDecompositionEngine.GetSubTasks(suspendedTask)

  // 2. Predict user intent from current input
  predictedIntent = IntentPredictionModule.PredictIntent(userInput, suspendedTask.dialogHistory)

  // 3. Score each sub-task based on intent match, resource availability, and task priority
  SCORES = []
  FOR each subTask IN subTasks:
    intentScore = CalculateIntentScore(subTask, predictedIntent)
    resourceScore = CalculateResourceScore(subTask)
    priorityScore = CalculatePriorityScore(subTask, suspendedTask)
    totalScore = (intentScore * WEIGHT_INTENT) + (resourceScore * WEIGHT_RESOURCE) + (priorityScore * WEIGHT_PRIORITY)
    SCORES.append((subTask, totalScore))

  // 4. Sort sub-tasks by score (descending)
  SORT SCORES by totalScore (descending)

  // 5. Return top N sub-tasks
  RETURN TOP_N(SCORES)
```

**IV. Example:**

A user suspends a task: “Book a trip to Hawaii”. Later, they say, “What about…”. The system proactively suggests:

*   “Find flights to Hawaii”
*   “Search for hotels in Honolulu”
*   “Rent a car in Hawaii”

**V. Hardware Considerations:**

*   Standard server-class hardware with sufficient CPU and memory to run ML models.
*   High-bandwidth network connection for API access and data transfer.
*   Optional GPU acceleration for ML model training and inference.
