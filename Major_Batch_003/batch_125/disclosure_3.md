## Adaptive Illumination & Material Property Mapping

**Concept:** Expand the multi-flash illumination system to not just enhance depth acquisition, but to *characterize* the material properties of surfaces within the scene. The current patent focuses on depth; this builds on that to gather reflectance, subsurface scattering, and potentially even basic texture information.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Augmentation:**

*   **Polarizing Filters:** Integrate a rotating polarizing filter array *before* each flash unit. Each flash will emit light with a different polarization angle (e.g., 0째, 45째, 90째, 135째).
*   **Spectral Filters:** Supplement the polarizing filters with narrow-band spectral filters. Each flash can emit in a different, narrow wavelength range (e.g., 450nm, 550nm, 650nm).
*   **High-Precision Sensors:** Utilize image sensors with improved dynamic range and sensitivity, particularly in the UV and near-infrared spectrum.  Calibration is critical.

**2. Software Pipeline:**

*   **Multi-Spectral Image Capture:** Capture a sequence of images as in the original patent, but now with polarization and spectral variations for each flash.
*   **Reflectance Calculation:** For each pixel, calculate the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) based on the polarized and spectral data. This requires a physics-based rendering model.
*   **Subsurface Scattering Estimation:** Model subsurface scattering by analyzing the spectral decay and diffusion of light within the material. This requires assumptions about the scattering properties, which can be refined with machine learning.
*   **Material Classification:**  Train a machine learning model (e.g., a Convolutional Neural Network) to classify materials based on their BRDF and subsurface scattering parameters. The training data should include a diverse range of materials and lighting conditions.
*   **Real-Time Rendering Enhancement:** Utilize the material classification and BRDF data to enhance real-time rendering of the scene. This can include physically based rendering (PBR) effects such as specular highlights, shadows, and reflections.
*   **Depth Map Refinement:** Integrate material properties into the depth map generation process.  Reflective surfaces can introduce errors in depth estimation; material classification can help to mitigate these errors.

**3. Data Structures:**

*   `MaterialProperties`:
    *   `BRDF`: (Array of floats, representing reflectance values across different angles)
    *   `SubsurfaceScatteringCoefficient`: (Float, representing the amount of light scattered beneath the surface)
    *   `MaterialClass`: (String, representing the predicted material type)
*   `PixelData`:
    *   `Depth`: (Float)
    *   `Color`: (RGB)
    *   `MaterialProperties`: (MaterialProperties)

**4. Pseudocode:**
