**Dynamic Contextual Availability & ‘Ghost Call’ System**

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple availability status (audio/video) to a system reflecting *context* of availability and enable a ‘ghost call’ preview for the contact, minimizing interruption and maximizing relevance.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Contextual Availability Profiles:** 
    *   User defines granular availability profiles beyond ‘available’ or ‘unavailable’. Examples: ‘Focus – Audio only’, ‘Quick Chat – immediate response’, ‘Driving – limited response/voice only’, ‘Meeting – no calls’, ‘Open to Video’, ‘Open to Collaboration (screen share)’
    *   These profiles are linked to calendar events, location data (optional user consent), and app usage (e.g., if in a presentation app, auto-set to ‘Meeting’).
    *   Availability profiles are displayed *visually* within the messaging thread – not just text.  A dashboard within the messaging app lets the user define and manage these profiles.

2.  **‘Ghost Call’ Preview System:**
    *   When a contact initiates a call attempt, *before* the actual call connects, the system performs a ‘ghost call’ - a silent, low-bandwidth connection.
    *   The ghost call assesses:
        *   User’s current availability profile.
        *   User’s current audio environment (ambient noise, whether wearing headphones).
        *   User’s current activity (motion detection via device sensors – are they walking/driving?).
    *   Based on the assessment, the system presents the contact with *options* before connecting the call:
        *   **‘Connect Now’**: Standard call connection.
        *   **‘Send Message Instead’**: Suggests a text message if the user is in a meeting or driving.
        *   **‘Schedule Call’**: Offers to schedule a call for a later time based on the user’s calendar availability.
        *   **‘Voice Memo’**: Captures a brief voice message which is played *before* ringing the user's device - essentially a call pre-screen.

3.  **Dynamic Thread Integration:**
    *   Availability profiles are visible directly within the messaging thread (a small icon/visual cue).  Hovering/tapping reveals details.
    *   Ghost call assessment results are displayed to the contact *before* connecting, giving them context. (e.g., “User is in a meeting. Suggest sending a message?”)
    *   Scheduled calls are automatically added to both user’s calendars with a direct link to the messaging thread for easy follow-up.

**Pseudocode (Contact side – initiating call):**

```
function initiateCall(userId) {
  // Attempt "Ghost Call" connection
  ghostCallConnection = establishGhostCall(userId);

  if (ghostCallConnection.success) {
    // Gather context from ghost call data
    userAvailabilityProfile = ghostCallConnection.availabilityProfile;
    ambientNoiseLevel = ghostCallConnection.ambientNoiseLevel;
    userActivity = ghostCallConnection.userActivity;

    // Display options to contact based on context
    displayCallOptions(userAvailabilityProfile, ambientNoiseLevel, userActivity);

    // If contact selects "Connect Now"
    if (selectedOption == "Connect Now") {
        establishFullCall(userId);
    } else if (selectedOption == "Send Message Instead") {
        openMessagingInterface(userId);
    } else if (selectedOption == "Schedule Call") {
        openSchedulingInterface(userId);
    }
    else if (selectedOption == "Voice Memo"){
        recordVoiceMemo(userId);
    }
  } else {
    // Ghost call failed - default to standard call connection
    establishFullCall(userId);
  }
}
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires low-bandwidth, persistent connection for ghost calls (likely leveraging existing messaging infrastructure).
*   Utilizes device sensors (microphone, accelerometer) for activity and environment assessment.
*   Needs integration with calendar and scheduling applications.
*   Privacy considerations around sensor data usage – requires explicit user consent.
