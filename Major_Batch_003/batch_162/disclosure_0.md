## Dynamic Headline “Constellations”

**Concept:** Instead of a linear or grid-based display of news headlines, present them as a dynamic “constellation” of interconnected points. Headline importance/recency dictates point brightness and size. Relationships *between* headlines (shared keywords, related events, trending topics) are visualized as connecting lines - like constellations. User interaction (mouse-over, touch) highlights related headlines, potentially animating the connections.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:** API access to multiple news sources. Real-time headline feed. Associated metadata: timestamp, source, keywords, sentiment score, geographic relevance.
*   **Visual Representation:**
    *   Headlines rendered as glowing points/spheres in a 3D space (simulated or true 3D).
    *   Point brightness: proportional to headline relevance (calculated from recency, sentiment, and source credibility).
    *   Point size: proportional to headline length/detail.
    *   Color: Categorized by news source (e.g., red for political, blue for business, green for science). Color saturation reflects sentiment (positive = brighter, negative = dimmer).
    *   Connections: Lines connecting headlines with shared keywords/relationships. Line thickness/brightness proportional to relationship strength (frequency of shared keywords, proximity in time).
    *   Background: Dark, neutral color to emphasize the “constellation”. Subtle animated background elements (e.g., slowly moving particles) to add visual interest.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   Mouse-over/Touch: Highlights a headline and *all* connected headlines. Animation: connecting lines pulse or brighten.  Detailed headline text displayed in a pop-up or side panel.
    *   Click: Opens the full article in a browser tab.
    *   Filtering: Users can filter headlines by category, source, keywords, or geographic location. Filters dynamically update the constellation display.
    *   Zoom/Pan: Allows users to explore the constellation in detail.
    *   “Trend Trails” -  Optional feature. Display faint, decaying trails showing how headlines have moved/changed position over time, indicating evolving news narratives.
*   **Pseudocode (Dynamic Connection Logic):**

```
// Headline object: {id, text, timestamp, keywords, sentiment, relevance}

function calculate_connections(headline_array) {
  connections = []
  for (i = 0; i < headline_array.length; i++) {
    for (j = i + 1; j < headline_array.length; j++) {
      shared_keywords = find_shared_keywords(headline_array[i].keywords, headline_array[j].keywords)
      if (shared_keywords.length > 0) {
        connection_strength = shared_keywords.length * (1 / time_difference(headline_array[i].timestamp, headline_array[j].timestamp))
        connections.push({source: headline_array[i].id, target: headline_array[j].id, strength: connection_strength})
      }
    }
  }
  return connections
}

function find_shared_keywords(keywords1, keywords2) {
  // Implement keyword comparison/matching logic (e.g., stemming, fuzzy matching)
  // Return array of shared keywords
}

function time_difference(timestamp1, timestamp2) {
  // Calculate time difference in seconds/minutes (for weighting)
}
```

*   **Hardware/Software:**
    *   Platform: Web browser, mobile app (iOS/Android).
    *   Rendering Engine: WebGL (for web), native 3D rendering (mobile).
    *   Programming Languages: JavaScript (web), Swift/Kotlin (mobile).
    *   Data Storage: Cloud database (for headline data).
