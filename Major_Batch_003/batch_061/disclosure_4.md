## Feature Importance Drift Detection & Adaptive Model Merging

**Concept:** Extend feature importance analysis to a time-series component, detecting 'drift' in feature contribution, and using this to dynamically merge/split model versions focused on different feature subsets. This goes beyond simple retraining; it actively orchestrates model *composition*.

**Specifications:**

**1. Drift Calculation Module:**

*   **Input:** Time-series data stream, trained machine learning model, feature importance metrics (calculated as in the base patent).
*   **Process:**
    *   Calculate rolling feature importance metrics over a defined window (e.g., 7 days, 30 days).
    *   Apply a drift detection algorithm (e.g., Page-Hinkley Test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test) to the rolling feature importance metrics for each feature.  Thresholds for drift detection are configurable.
    *   Output: Drift score for each feature, indicating the magnitude and direction of change in its importance.

    ```pseudocode
    function calculate_drift(time_series_data, model, window_size, drift_threshold):
        rolling_importances = {}
        for feature in model.features:
            rolling_importances[feature] = []

        for time_point in time_series_data:
            importances = calculate_feature_importances(model, time_point)  # From base patent
            for feature, importance in importances.items():
                rolling_importances[feature].append(importance)

        drift_scores = {}
        for feature in rolling_importances:
            drift_score = detect_drift(rolling_importances[feature], drift_threshold) # Using Page-Hinkley or KS Test
            drift_scores[feature] = drift_score

        return drift_scores
    ```

**2.  Model Versioning & Subset Training:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Based on drift scores, features are categorized into 'Stable', 'Rising', 'Falling', and 'Uncertain'.
    *   Separate model versions are trained, each focused on a subset of features.
        *   'Core Model': Trained on 'Stable' features.
        *   'Rising Feature Models':  Individual models for each 'Rising' feature, combined with the 'Core Model'.
        *   'Falling Feature Models': Individual models for each 'Falling' feature, combined with the 'Core Model'. (These might eventually be phased out).
    *   A 'Model Manager' orchestrates these models.

**3.  Model Manager & Dynamic Ensemble:**

*   **Input:** Incoming data point, drift scores, trained model versions.
*   **Process:**
    *   Determine which models are most relevant to the incoming data point.  This could be based on a confidence score derived from the drift scores and the model's performance on similar data.
    *   Combine the predictions of the relevant models using a weighted averaging approach. Weights are dynamically adjusted based on model performance and drift scores.
    *   A 'Model Splitter' component can identify features where models consistently disagree, triggering the creation of a new model version focused on that feature.

    ```pseudocode
    function predict(data_point, models, drift_scores):
        relevant_models = identify_relevant_models(data_point, models, drift_scores) # Based on drift scores and data characteristics
        weighted_predictions = []

        for model in relevant_models:
            prediction = model.predict(data_point)
            weight = calculate_weight(model, drift_scores) # Higher weight for models with stable features & recent performance
            weighted_predictions.append(prediction * weight)

        final_prediction = average(weighted_predictions)
        return final_prediction
    ```

**4. Automated Data Pipeline Adjustment:**

*   When a feature enters the ‘Falling’ category, the system *automatically* reduces the collection frequency of that feature's data. This conserves resources and simplifies the pipeline.
*   Conversely, when a feature enters the ‘Rising’ category, the system *increases* the collection frequency or adds new data sources for that feature.



This system goes beyond simply managing feature importance; it creates a self-adjusting, dynamic ensemble of models, optimized for evolving data patterns and resource efficiency. It introduces a feedback loop where feature importance drives model composition, data collection, and resource allocation.
