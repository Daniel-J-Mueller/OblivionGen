## Dynamic Agent Persona Synthesis

**Concept:** Expand the multi-agent system's capabilities by dynamically synthesizing agent personas *during* response generation, not just pre-defining them. This allows for highly nuanced and context-specific interactions.

**Specifications:**

*   **Persona Database:** Maintain a database of ‘persona components’ – linguistic styles (formal, informal, humorous), knowledge domains (history, science, cooking), emotional ranges (empathetic, assertive, neutral), and reasoning styles (deductive, inductive, abductive). These are *not* full personas but modular building blocks.
*   **Query Analysis Module:** Analyze the user query for ‘persona cues’ - implicit or explicit requests for specific traits. Example: “Explain this like I’m five” (youthful, simplified explanation) or “Give me a legal perspective” (formal, knowledge-domain specific).
*   **Persona Synthesis Engine:** Based on persona cues, assemble a temporary agent persona using components from the database.  Prioritize components based on relevance score (determined by semantic similarity to cues) and novelty (introduce less-used components to avoid repetitive responses).
*   **Response Generation Integration:**  The stitching model now receives not just execution results, but also the synthesized agent persona as context. It modifies the language, tone, and reasoning style of the multi-perspective response to align with the persona.
*   **Persona Memory & Evolution:**  Store successful persona syntheses (query, cues, components, response quality). Use this data to refine component relevance scores and evolve the persona database over time.
*   **Multi-Modal Persona Extension:** Extend persona definition to include visual/auditory cues for head-mounted display – virtual avatar appearance, voice tone, background music.

**Pseudocode (Persona Synthesis Engine):**

```
function synthesizePersona(userQuery):
  cues = analyzeQuery(userQuery)
  relevantComponents = retrieveComponents(cues, database)  //Sort by Relevance Score
  noveltyScore = calculateNovelty(relevantComponents) //Maximize exposure to new elements
  selectedComponents = prioritizeComponents(relevantComponents, noveltyScore) //Prioritize new and relevant
  persona = assemblePersona(selectedComponents)
  return persona
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Employ transformer models for both cue analysis and component selection.
*   Use reinforcement learning to optimize the novelty score and reward diverse persona combinations.
*   Design a flexible persona data structure to accommodate various component types and attributes.
*   Experiment with different weighting schemes for relevance and novelty to find the optimal balance.
