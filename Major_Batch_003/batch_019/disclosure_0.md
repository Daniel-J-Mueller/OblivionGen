## Haptic Temple Feedback System

**Concept:** Integrate micro-actuators within the temple arm of eyewear, synchronized with incoming wireless communication events. This creates a subtle haptic feedback system, allowing the user to 'feel' notifications or identify the source of incoming signals without relying solely on audio or visual cues.

**Specs:**

*   **Actuator Type:** Piezoelectric benders, chosen for their low power consumption, rapid response time, and small form factor.  Each temple arm will house 3-5 actuators.
*   **Actuator Placement:** Distributed along the length of the temple arm, prioritized towards the rear portion near the ear.  Placement will be configurable via software to optimize comfort and perceived signal direction.
*   **Haptic Patterns:** Library of pre-defined haptic patterns, each representing a different type of notification or signal source (e.g., a short pulse for text message, a long vibration for phone call, distinct patterns for different apps).  User-customizable patterns will be supported.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Wireless communication (Bluetooth Low Energy preferred) to receive notification data from a paired smartphone or other device.
*   **Power Source:** Integrated rechargeable battery within the temple arm.  Wireless charging capability.
*   **Software Integration:**  Dedicated mobile app for configuration, customization, and firmware updates. Integration with existing notification systems on smartphones.
*   **Signal Processing Unit (SPU):** Low-power microcontroller within the temple arm to receive communication data, translate it into appropriate haptic patterns, and control the actuators.  The SPU will also manage battery life and wireless charging.
*   **Temple Arm Material:**  Utilize a composite material with integrated conductive pathways for power and data transmission to the actuators. Flexibility and durability are paramount.

**Pseudocode (SPU Firmware):**

```
// Initialization
initialize_bluetooth()
initialize_actuators()
battery_status = read_battery_level()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Check for Bluetooth connection
    if (bluetooth_connected()) {
        // Receive notification data
        notification_data = receive_notification()

        // Determine haptic pattern based on notification type
        haptic_pattern = get_haptic_pattern(notification_data.type)

        // Activate actuators according to the haptic pattern
        activate_actuators(haptic_pattern)
    }
    else {
        // Disable actuators
        deactivate_actuators()
    }

    // Update battery status
    battery_status = read_battery_level()

    // Sleep to conserve power
    sleep(100ms)
}

// Function to get haptic pattern
function get_haptic_pattern(notification_type) {
    // Switch statement to return appropriate pattern based on notification_type
    switch (notification_type) {
        case "text_message":
            return pattern_short_pulse
        case "phone_call":
            return pattern_long_vibration
        case "app_notification":
            return pattern_app_specific
        default:
            return pattern_default
    }
}

// Function to activate actuators
function activate_actuators(pattern) {
    // Iterate through the pattern array
    for each element in pattern {
        // Activate corresponding actuator
        set_actuator(element.actuator_id, element.intensity, element.duration)
    }
}
```

This system expands on the wireless connectivity of the patent by introducing a new sensory modality—haptics—for improved user experience and accessibility. It offers a discreet and intuitive way to stay connected without relying solely on visual or auditory notifications.
