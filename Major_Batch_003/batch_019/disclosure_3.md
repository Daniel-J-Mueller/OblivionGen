## Adaptive Data Synthesis with Generative Models

**Concept:** Expand the secure multi-party computation framework to incorporate generative AI for data synthesis, allowing for richer analysis and mitigating privacy concerns by sharing *synthetic* data rather than raw data vectors.

**Specification:**

**1. Synthetic Data Generation Module:**

*   **Input:**
    *   First Dataset (Party A) - Vector data with membership information (Test/Control/Neither).
    *   Second Dataset (Party B) - Vector data with conversion information.
    *   Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) parameters - Defines privacy thresholds and communication protocols.
    *   Generative Model Architecture - User-selectable (e.g., Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)).  Configuration includes layer count, node density, activation functions.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **SMPC-Protected Feature Extraction:**  Utilize SMPC to collaboratively determine relevant feature vectors from *both* datasets *without* revealing the underlying raw data. This step prioritizes features predictive of conversion and membership.
    2.  **Generative Model Training (Federated):**  Train the selected generative model *in a federated manner*. Each party trains the model locally on its extracted features, then shares *only* model weights (gradients) via SMPC.  This preserves data locality and minimizes information leakage.
    3.  **Synthetic Data Generation:**  Each party generates synthetic data vectors based on the trained generative model.  Crucially, the synthetic data retains statistical properties linked to conversion and membership *without* being directly traceable to any individual in the original datasets.
    4.  **Differential Privacy Application:** Apply differential privacy mechanisms (e.g., adding noise) to the generated synthetic data, offering provable privacy guarantees.  Parameter: epsilon (privacy budget).
*   **Output:**
    *   Synthetic Dataset A -  Synthetic vectors with assigned membership (Test/Control/Neither).
    *   Synthetic Dataset B - Synthetic vectors with assigned conversion status.

**2.  Analysis & Reporting Module:**

*   **Input:**  Synthetic Dataset A, Synthetic Dataset B, Desired Analytics (Conversion rates, A/B test performance).
*   **Process:** Perform desired analytics on the *synthetic* datasets.  This eliminates the need to directly share raw data.
*   **Output:** Reports on conversion rates, A/B test results, and other insights derived from the synthetic data.

**3.  Pseudocode for Federated Training:**

```
// Party A (Has Dataset A & Membership Info)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
  // Local Training
  local_model = train_model(Dataset_A, model_architecture)

  // Secure Weight Sharing (using SMPC)
  encrypted_weights = encrypt_weights(local_model.weights)
  shared_weights = communicate_weights(encrypted_weights, Party_B)

  // Decrypt & Aggregate Weights (Party B performs decryption)
  decrypted_weights = decrypt_weights(shared_weights)
  aggregated_weights = aggregate_weights(decrypted_weights, Party_B.local_model.weights)

  // Update Local Model with Aggregated Weights
  local_model.weights = aggregated_weights
```

**4.  Technical Specifications:**

*   **SMPC Protocol:** Secure Aggregation, Homomorphic Encryption, or Secret Sharing.
*   **Generative Model Framework:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, or JAX.
*   **Data Vector Dimensionality:** Configurable, supports high-dimensional data.
*   **Scalability:** Designed for distributed processing across multiple parties.
*   **Privacy Metrics:** Differential Privacy (epsilon, delta), k-anonymity.
