## Predictive Power Allocation System

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply *notifying* servers of impending power loss. Implement a system that dynamically allocates remaining power resources *during* a power event, prioritizing critical services and gracefully shutting down less essential ones. This goes beyond graceful shutdown; it’s about maximizing uptime for the most important functions even *while* experiencing a power interruption.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   **Power Distribution Units (PDUs) with Granular Control:** PDUs must offer individual outlet control and power monitoring.  Each outlet connects to a specific server component or sub-system.
    *   **Real-Time Power Monitoring:**  Each PDU outlet integrates a current/voltage sensor, feeding data to a central controller.
    *   **Central Controller:** A dedicated server running the ‘Power Allocation Manager’ software.
    *   **Communication Network:** High-bandwidth, low-latency network connecting the PDUs to the Central Controller (10Gbit Ethernet preferred).
    *   **Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) Integration:**  The system integrates with existing UPS infrastructure, but *augments* it, rather than relying solely on it. The UPS provides the initial bridge, while this system optimizes resource allocation *during* the UPS runtime.
*   **Software – Power Allocation Manager:**
    *   **Service Dependency Mapping:**  Administrator defines dependencies between services running on servers (e.g., Database -> Web Server -> Front-End).  This is a hierarchical mapping.
    *   **Service Priority Assignment:**  Administrator assigns a priority level to each service (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
    *   **Real-Time Power Consumption Analysis:**  Software constantly monitors the power draw of each server, component, and service.
    *   **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizing historical power consumption data and current load, the system *predicts* future power demands.  This uses a time-series forecasting algorithm (e.g., Prophet, LSTM).
    *   **Dynamic Power Allocation Algorithm:**
        1.  When a power interruption is detected (from the existing patent system), the algorithm initiates.
        2.  It calculates the remaining power budget based on UPS capacity and estimated runtime.
        3.  Services are evaluated based on priority and dependency.
        4.  Power is dynamically allocated to ensure Critical and High priority services remain online as long as possible.
        5.  Medium and Low priority services are gracefully shut down or throttled to conserve power. This isn't a simple 'off' switch – it's a controlled reduction of resources.
        6.  The system continuously re-evaluates and adjusts allocation based on changing conditions.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   **Power Control Messages:** Standardized messages to control PDU outlets (ON, OFF, THROTTLE).
    *   **Telemetry Data:** Real-time power consumption data from PDUs to the Central Controller.
    *   **Status Updates:**  The Central Controller broadcasts system status to administrators.
*   **Pseudocode – Dynamic Allocation Algorithm:**

```
function allocatePower(powerBudget, serviceList) {
  // Sort services by priority (descending)
  sortedServices = serviceList.sort( (a, b) => b.priority - a.priority )

  remainingBudget = powerBudget

  for (service in sortedServices) {
    if (service.powerDemand <= remainingBudget) {
      service.status = "ON"
      remainingBudget -= service.powerDemand
    } else if (service.powerDemand > remainingBudget && service.priority > "LOW") {
      // Throttle service
      throttledDemand = remainingBudget
      service.status = "THROTTLED"
      service.powerDemand = throttledDemand
      remainingBudget = 0
      break // No more power available
    } else {
      service.status = "OFF"
      service.powerDemand = 0
    }
  }
}

//Main loop runs on power interruption
onPowerInterruption(){
    powerBudget = UPS_Capacity * UPS_Remaining_Runtime
    allocatePower(powerBudget, serviceList)
    //Continually run the allocation algorithm to re-evaluate demand.
}
```

*   **Advanced Feature – Predictive Shutdown:** Based on historical data and current load, the system can *predict* potential power overloads *before* they occur and proactively shut down less critical services to prevent outages.
