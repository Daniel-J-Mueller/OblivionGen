## Adaptive Prescriptive Illumination System for Dynamic Visual Acuity Testing

**System Overview:** A portable, head-mounted device designed to dynamically adjust illumination patterns and intensity to optimize visual acuity testing in diverse environments and for individuals with varying visual impairments. This builds on the modulation transfer function (MTF) concept from the patent, but shifts the focus *from* lens correction *to* dynamic stimulus optimization.

**Core Components:**

*   **High-Resolution Micro-LED Array:** A dense array of individually controllable micro-LEDs integrated into a lightweight head-mounted band. Resolution: 1920x1080 per eye. Dynamic range: 1000:1 contrast ratio.
*   **Eye-Tracking System:** Integrated infrared eye-tracking system (120Hz sampling rate) to precisely monitor pupil position, gaze direction, and blink rate.
*   **Pupillometry Module:**  Real-time pupillometry analysis to measure pupil diameter, velocity, and constriction/dilation responses.
*   **Computational Unit:** Embedded processor (Nvidia Jetson Nano equivalent) for real-time image processing, eye-tracking data analysis, and illumination control.
*   **Glint Source Integration:**  Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) incorporated into the micro-LED array for generating controlled glint patterns. Wavelength: 635nm (red).
*   **MTF Prediction Module:** Utilizes a neural network (trained on a large dataset of eye and vision characteristics) to *predict* an individual’s optimal MTF based on eye-tracking, pupillometry, and pre-test questionnaire data.
*   **Adaptive Illumination Algorithm:** The core algorithm driving the system. This algorithm dynamically adjusts the micro-LED array’s illumination patterns, intensity, and glint source patterns based on the predicted MTF, eye movements, and pupillometry data.

**Pseudocode for Adaptive Illumination Algorithm:**

```
// Initialization
load MTF Prediction Model
initialize Eye Tracking & Pupillometry Systems

// Main Loop
while (test running) {
  // 1. Gather Data
  eye_position = get_eye_position()
  pupil_diameter = get_pupil_diameter()
  blink_rate = get_blink_rate()
  
  // 2. Predict Optimal MTF
  predicted_mtf = predict_mtf(eye_position, pupil_diameter, blink_rate)

  // 3. Generate Illumination Pattern
  illumination_pattern = generate_pattern(predicted_mtf)
  // illumination_pattern includes:
  //    - Micro-LED intensity map
  //    - Glint source activation pattern

  // 4. Apply Illumination Pattern
  set_microled_array(illumination_pattern.microled_map)
  set_glint_sources(illumination_pattern.glint_pattern)
  
  // 5. Present Visual Stimulus (e.g., Snellen chart, grating)
  
  // 6. Capture Response & Adjust (Learning Loop - optional)
  //  - Analyze response to stimulus
  //  - Refine MTF prediction & illumination pattern
}
```

**Operating Modes:**

*   **Diagnostic Mode:**  Automated visual acuity testing with dynamic illumination. The system presents a series of stimuli and adapts the illumination pattern to optimize stimulus visibility.
*   **Training Mode:**  Provides guided visual exercises with dynamic illumination to improve visual skills.
*   **Research Mode:**  Allows researchers to collect detailed data on eye movements, pupillometry, and visual performance under different illumination conditions.

**Power Requirements:**

*   Battery Life: 4 hours continuous use.
*   Charging: USB-C.

**Materials:**

*   Lightweight polymer housing.
*   Breathable, adjustable head strap.
*   Anti-glare coating for micro-LED array.
