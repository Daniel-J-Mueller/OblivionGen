**Dynamic Neural Texture Synthesis for Real-Time Style & Detail Augmentation**

**Concept:** Expand the image enhancement pipeline to dynamically synthesize textures *within* the image based on semantic understanding, going beyond simple filtering and enhancement. This is about *creating* detail, not just revealing it.

**Specs:**

1.  **Semantic Segmentation Module:** Integrate a high-resolution semantic segmentation network (e.g., a modified DeepLabv3+) to identify objects, materials (skin, foliage, metal, glass), and regions within the input frame. Output: Segmentation map with detailed class probabilities.

2.  **Texture Library & Procedural Generation:** Maintain a library of high-resolution, physically-based rendering (PBR) textures categorized by material type. Implement procedural generation algorithms capable of creating variations of these textures (e.g., variations in wood grain, metal scratches, fabric weave).

3.  **Neural Style Transfer Network (Modified):** Adapt a style transfer network (e.g., based on AdaIN) to *not* transfer styles from reference images but to *blend* textures from the library and procedurally generated variations, guided by the semantic segmentation map. This network’s architecture will emphasize localized texture synthesis rather than global style application.

4.  **Bilateral Grid Integration:** Utilize the existing bilateral grid concept *not just* for color transformations but to control the *scale, orientation, and blending weights* of synthesized textures.  The bilateral grid becomes a texture control grid.

5.  **Real-Time Rendering Pipeline:** The entire process (segmentation, texture synthesis, blending, and upscaling) is implemented within a highly optimized GPU shader pipeline.  Focus on minimizing memory transfers and maximizing parallel processing.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: Input Frame (Image)

// Stage 1: Semantic Segmentation
SegmentationMap = SemanticSegmentationNetwork(Input Frame);

// Stage 2: Texture Selection & Generation
For Each Pixel in Input Frame:
    MaterialType = SegmentationMap[Pixel];
    If MaterialType is known:
        BaseTexture = RetrieveBaseTexture(MaterialType);
        GeneratedTexture = ProceduralTextureGenerator(BaseTexture, Pixel Coordinates);
    Else:
        GeneratedTexture = DefaultTexture;

// Stage 3: Bilateral Grid Control
BilateralGrid = CalculateBilateralGrid(Input Frame);
For Each Pixel in Input Frame:
    Scale = BilateralGrid[Pixel].Scale;
    Orientation = BilateralGrid[Pixel].Orientation;
    BlendWeight = BilateralGrid[Pixel].BlendWeight;
    AdjustedTexture = ApplyScaleAndOrientation(GeneratedTexture, Scale, Orientation);
    FinalTexture = BlendTextures(AdjustedTexture, Input Frame, BlendWeight);

// Stage 4: High-Resolution Upscaling & Rendering
UpscaledFrame = Upscale(FinalTexture);
Output Frame = Render(UpscaledFrame);
```

**Novelty:**

This moves beyond simple image enhancement towards *procedural content creation within the image itself*. The semantic understanding drives the synthesis of entirely new detail, making even low-resolution images appear rich and realistic.  It's not just making existing detail clearer; it’s *creating* detail where none existed before, guided by AI.  The integration with the bilateral grid provides fine-grained control over the texture synthesis process, allowing for highly customized results.
