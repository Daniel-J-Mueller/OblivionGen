## Dynamic Kernel Composition for Spatio-Temporal Data

**Concept:** Expand beyond static 3D kernels and enable *dynamic* kernel construction at runtime, tailored to localized features within the input data stream. This leverages the rearranged data’s optimized layout to accelerate kernel composition and application.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structure: Feature Cubes**

*   Input data is segmented into "Feature Cubes" – small 3D volumes representing localized regions (e.g., 8x8x8 voxels).
*   Each Feature Cube is associated with a “Feature Vector” – a condensed representation of its salient characteristics (calculated by a pre-processing stage – see section 4).

**2. Kernel Library & Composition Engine**

*   A library of “Kernel Primitives” - small, optimized 3D convolution kernels targeting specific low-level features (edges, corners, textures, motion vectors). These are stored in a highly optimized, linearized format suitable for the matrix computing unit.
*   A “Kernel Composition Engine” dynamically selects and combines Kernel Primitives to create a composite kernel tailored to the Feature Vector of each incoming Feature Cube.
*   Composition rules are defined as a graph structure: Nodes represent Kernel Primitives, and edges define how they are combined (e.g., summation, concatenation, element-wise multiplication).  The weights of these edges can be learned.

**3. Optimized Data Flow:**

1.  **Feature Cube Extraction:** Input data stream is divided into Feature Cubes.
2.  **Feature Vector Calculation:** Each Feature Cube's characteristics are extracted and summarized into a Feature Vector.
3.  **Kernel Composition:** The Kernel Composition Engine uses the Feature Vector to determine the optimal combination of Kernel Primitives.
4.  **Kernel Linearization:** The composite kernel is linearized into a format compatible with the matrix computing unit.
5.  **Convolution:** The linearized composite kernel is applied to the Feature Cube using the rearranged data layout.

**4. Pre-Processing Stage - Feature Vector Generation**

*   This stage could leverage existing CNN layers to extract relevant features.  Consider using a small, fixed-size CNN to generate the Feature Vector.
*   Alternatively, hand-crafted features like histograms of gradients, local binary patterns, or optical flow vectors can be used.

**5. Hardware Interface & Data Layout**

*   The memory organizer unit is extended to handle both the input Feature Cubes and the dynamically generated, linearized composite kernels.
*   Data rearrangement optimizes for both: 
    *   Efficient access to the input Feature Cube data.
    *   Rapid loading of the linearized composite kernel into the matrix computing unit.
*   Consider a ping-pong buffer scheme for the composite kernel, allowing the matrix computing unit to process one Feature Cube while the next kernel is being composed.

**Pseudocode (Kernel Composition Engine):**

```
function compose_kernel(feature_vector):
  kernel_graph = load_kernel_graph()  // Load pre-defined composition rules
  
  // Traverse the graph based on the feature vector
  selected_primitives = traverse_graph(kernel_graph, feature_vector)
  
  composite_kernel = combine_primitives(selected_primitives) 
  
  linearized_kernel = linearize_kernel(composite_kernel)
  
  return linearized_kernel
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Adaptive filtering tailored to localized features.
*   Improved performance compared to applying fixed kernels to heterogeneous data.
*   Reduced memory footprint by only loading relevant kernel components.
*   Potential for learning optimal kernel composition rules.
