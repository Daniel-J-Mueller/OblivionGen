## Dynamic Content Hierarchies & Predictive Engagement

**Concept:** Extend the existing system to dynamically construct content hierarchies *based on predicted user engagement*, rather than pre-defined hierarchies. This moves beyond simply showing a fallback ad if the primary content isn’t interacted with; it anticipates likely engagement and presents content accordingly.

**Specifications:**

*   **Engagement Prediction Model:** Develop a machine learning model that predicts user engagement (clicks, views, time spent) with different content types based on user profile, tracked actions (from the patent), time of day, and contextual factors. This model outputs a probability score for each content item.
*   **Dynamic Hierarchy Construction:**  Upon identifying a potential content opportunity, the system will:
    1.  Retrieve a pool of candidate content items.
    2.  Run each item through the Engagement Prediction Model.
    3.  Sort content items based on the predicted engagement score.
    4.  Construct a content hierarchy. The highest-scoring item is the root. Subsequent levels are populated with items with successively lower scores, branching out to create a 'tree' of possibilities.  The depth of the tree is configurable.
*   **Adaptive Presentation Logic:**
    *   Initially present the root node (highest predicted engagement).
    *   Track user interaction.
    *   If no interaction occurs within a defined timeframe, automatically traverse down to the next level of the hierarchy, presenting the next highest scoring content.
    *   This continues until interaction occurs or the bottom of the tree is reached.
*   **Contextual Weighting:**
    *   Allow advertisers to assign “contextual weights” to different hierarchy levels. For example, an advertiser might prioritize brand awareness content at higher levels, and conversion-focused content at lower levels.
*   **Real-time Adjustment:** The Engagement Prediction Model will be continuously retrained with new user data, ensuring the hierarchy construction and content presentation remain optimized in real-time.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION PresentContent(userProfile, opportunityTimestamp):

  candidateContent = GetCandidateContent(userProfile)
  predictedEngagement = PredictEngagement(candidateContent, userProfile, opportunityTimestamp)
  contentHierarchy = BuildHierarchy(candidateContent, predictedEngagement)

  currentContent = contentHierarchy.root

  WHILE currentContent != NULL AND noInteraction(currentContent, timeout):
    Present(currentContent)
    currentContent = contentHierarchy.getNext(currentContent)

  IF interaction(currentContent):
    LogInteraction(currentContent, userProfile)
  ELSE:
    LogNoInteraction(contentHierarchy)

  RETURN

FUNCTION PredictEngagement(candidateContent, userProfile, opportunityTimestamp):
  # Machine learning model that returns a score for each item
  scores = MLModel.predict(candidateContent, userProfile, opportunityTimestamp)
  RETURN scores

FUNCTION BuildHierarchy(candidateContent, scores):
  sortedContent = SortContent(candidateContent, scores)
  hierarchy = new ContentHierarchy()
  hierarchy.root = sortedContent[0]
  # Build the rest of the tree based on the scores and branching factors
  # ...
  RETURN hierarchy
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ContentHierarchy`:  A tree-like data structure representing the content hierarchy.
*   `ContentItem`: Object containing content data, metadata, and predicted engagement score.
*   `Userprofile`: User data and tracked actions.
