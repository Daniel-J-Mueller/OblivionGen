## Dynamic Content Component Weighting & User Preference Integration

**Concept:** Extend the existing system by incorporating real-time user preference signals to dynamically weight content components *before* they are fed into the content processing models. This allows for a more personalized and nuanced filtering process, going beyond static policy thresholds.

**Specifications:**

**1. User Preference Data Collection:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate data from explicit user feedback (likes, dislikes, reports, saves), implicit behavioral signals (dwell time on content, scroll depth, shares, comment sentiment), and demographic/interest profiles.
*   **Preference Vectors:** Construct a preference vector for each user representing their affinity towards different content components (e.g., product categories, image styles, textual themes).  Component tags will need to be expanded beyond the initial set.
*   **Real-time Updates:** Preference vectors are continuously updated based on user interactions.  A decay function will be applied to historical data to prioritize recent behavior.

**2. Dynamic Component Weighting Module:**

*   **Input:** Content piece with identified content components, user preference vector.
*   **Process:**
    *   For each content component in the piece, calculate a “preference score” based on the user's preference vector.  (e.g., dot product of component vector and user preference vector).
    *   Normalize the preference scores for all components in the piece to sum to 1.
    *   Apply these normalized scores as weights to the features derived from each content component *before* they are passed to the content processing models.
*   **Output:** Weighted feature vector representing the content piece, tailored to the user’s preferences.

**3. Model Integration:**

*   The content processing models remain largely unchanged. They now receive weighted feature vectors as input.
*   Retrain models periodically with data incorporating user preference weighting to improve performance.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   A new module, “User Preference Engine”, will handle preference vector creation and management.
*   The “Dynamic Component Weighting Module” will reside between the content ingestion pipeline and the content processing models.
*   API endpoints will be created to allow other services (e.g., recommendation engines) to access user preference data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// User Preference Engine
function getUserPreferenceVector(userID):
    // Retrieve historical interaction data for userID
    data = getInteractionData(userID)
    // Calculate component affinity scores based on data
    scores = calculateComponentScores(data)
    // Normalize scores to create preference vector
    vector = normalize(scores)
    return vector

// Dynamic Component Weighting Module
function weightContentComponents(content, userID):
    // Get user preference vector
    preferenceVector = getUserPreferenceVector(userID)
    // Extract content components
    components = extractComponents(content)
    // Calculate component weights based on preference vector
    componentWeights = calculateComponentWeights(components, preferenceVector)
    // Apply weights to component features
    weightedFeatures = applyWeightsToFeatures(content, componentWeights)
    return weightedFeatures
```

**Potential benefits:**

*   Increased user engagement through more relevant content filtering.
*   Improved model accuracy by incorporating personalized signals.
*   Ability to cater to diverse user preferences and sensitivities.
*   More granular control over content presentation.
