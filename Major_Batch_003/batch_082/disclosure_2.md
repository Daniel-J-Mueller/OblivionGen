## Adaptive Ontology for Multi-Modal Input & Predictive Action Sequencing

**Concept:** Extend the structural ontology beyond natural language to encompass multi-modal input (visual, audio, sensor data) and introduce predictive action sequencing based on probabilistic modeling of user intent.

**Specifications:**

**1. Multi-Modal Ontology Extension:**

*   **Data Types:** Augment ontology definitions to include data type specifications for non-textual inputs:
    *   `IMAGE`: Defines expected image properties (resolution, format, object classes).
    *   `AUDIO`: Defines expected audio properties (sample rate, duration, keywords, emotion analysis).
    *   `SENSOR`: Defines expected sensor data types (temperature, location, acceleration) and units.
*   **Input Mapping:** Define rules for mapping multi-modal input to semantic units (actions, objects, attributes) within the ontology.  Example:  An image of a "red apple" maps to `OBJECT: apple`, `ATTRIBUTE: color: red`.
*   **Fusion Logic:** Implement fusion logic to combine information from multiple modalities. Example: Natural language "turn on the lights" + image of a living room = prioritize actions related to lighting in that room.

**2. Intent Prediction Engine:**

*   **Probabilistic Model:** Employ a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to learn sequences of user actions and predict the next most likely action.
*   **Contextual Features:**  Incorporate contextual features into the model:
    *   Time of day
    *   User location
    *   User profile
    *   Recent user interactions
    *   Sensor data (e.g., room temperature)
*   **Confidence Threshold:**  Implement a confidence threshold for predicted actions. If the confidence is above the threshold, the system can proactively suggest or initiate the action.
*   **Action Sequencing:** The system isn’t reacting to single actions, but *sequencing* actions. The intent engine builds probable workflows by chaining likely outputs.

**3. Dynamic Ontology Adaptation:**

*   **Knowledge Graph Integration:**  Integrate the structural ontology with a knowledge graph (e.g., Wikidata, ConceptNet) to enrich semantic representations and improve reasoning capabilities.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Employ reinforcement learning to dynamically adapt the ontology based on user feedback and interaction data.  The system learns which ontology structures are most effective for understanding and fulfilling user requests.
*   **User-Specific Ontologies:** Allow users to customize the ontology by adding new objects, attributes, and actions, creating personalized experiences.

**Pseudocode – Intent Prediction:**

```
function predictNextAction(userContext, currentActionSequence):
  // userContext:  Contains user profile, location, time, sensor data
  // currentActionSequence: List of previous actions taken by the user

  // 1. Feature Extraction:  Combine userContext and currentActionSequence
  features = extractFeatures(userContext, currentActionSequence)

  // 2. Probabilistic Modeling:  Use trained HMM/RNN to predict next action probabilities
  actionProbabilities = model.predict(features)

  // 3. Confidence Filtering: Filter out actions with low probabilities
  filteredActions = filterActions(actionProbabilities, confidenceThreshold)

  // 4. Recommendation/Execution:
  if filteredActions.length > 0:
    recommendedAction = filteredActions[0]  // Select most likely action
    return recommendedAction
  else:
    return null  // No clear prediction
```

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   High-performance CPU and GPU for training and running machine learning models.
*   Multi-modal sensors (camera, microphone, temperature sensor, etc.) for capturing diverse input data.
*   Large-capacity storage for storing training data and model parameters.
*   High-bandwidth network connectivity for accessing external knowledge graphs and APIs.
