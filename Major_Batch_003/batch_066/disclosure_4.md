## Dynamic Bot Persona Synthesis

**Specification:** A system to dynamically construct and deploy messaging bot personas based on real-time user emotional state and inferred social context.

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing bot invocation model to include *proactive* bot instantiation. Rather than simply presenting options based on intent/location, the system *creates* a bot tailored to the user’s current state.

**Components:**

1.  **Affective Sensor Suite:**  Integration with client device sensors (camera, microphone, keyboard input analysis) to infer user emotional state (joy, sadness, anger, frustration, etc.).  May also integrate with external data sources (calendar events, recent communications) to build a broader emotional profile.

2.  **Social Context Engine:** Analysis of current messaging conversation (tone, keywords, sender/recipient relationships), recent communication history, and user social graph to infer the social context (e.g., casual chat with a friend, urgent request from a colleague, negotiation with a vendor).

3.  **Persona Generator:**  A module leveraging a large language model (LLM) and a database of pre-defined “persona templates.” 
    *   **Persona Templates:**  Represent archetypal bot personalities (e.g., “Supportive Friend,” “Efficient Assistant,” “Playful Companion,” “Stern Negotiator”). Each template defines behavior, response style, vocabulary, and potentially even a synthesized voice/avatar. 
    *   The LLM dynamically *mixes* and *modifies* these templates based on the output of the Affective Sensor Suite and Social Context Engine. The goal is to create a bot that is both contextually appropriate and emotionally resonant.

4.  **Dynamic Bot Deployment:**  A system to rapidly instantiate and deploy the generated bot within the messaging application. This would require an efficient bot framework capable of handling a large number of unique bot instances.

**Pseudocode (Persona Generation):**

```
FUNCTION generatePersona(emotionalState, socialContext, userProfile):
  // Retrieve relevant persona templates based on emotional state and social context
  candidateTemplates = SELECT templates FROM personaDatabase WHERE 
    emotionalMatch(emotionalState, template.emotionalProfile) AND 
    contextualMatch(socialContext, template.contextualProfile)

  // Prioritize templates based on user preferences (if available)
  prioritizedTemplates = RANK(candidateTemplates, userProfile.personaPreferences)

  // If no suitable templates are found, create a default persona
  IF prioritizedTemplates is empty THEN
    defaultPersona = CREATE_DEFAULT_PERSONA()
    RETURN defaultPersona

  // Select the top template
  selectedTemplate = prioritizedTemplates[0]

  // Modify the template based on user profile and current context
  modifiedTemplate = MODIFY_TEMPLATE(selectedTemplate, userProfile, socialContext) 
  // Example modifications: adjust formality level, vocabulary, response speed

  // Instantiate the bot using the modified template
  newBot = CREATE_BOT(modifiedTemplate)

  RETURN newBot
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond simply *responding* to user intent to *anticipating* user needs and proactively offering support in a way that is both functional and emotionally intelligent. Extends bot control from menu driven selection, to AI driven generation.
