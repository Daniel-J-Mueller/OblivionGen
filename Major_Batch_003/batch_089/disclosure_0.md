## Adaptive Cavity Polarization Filter

**Concept:** A bandpass filter leveraging tunable polarization within each cavity to dynamically shift the resonant frequency and bandwidth. This moves beyond simple geometric tuning (slot overlaps) to *active* frequency control.

**Specs:**

*   **Cavity Material:** Primarily air, with embedded layers of liquid crystal material (LCM) along the cavity walls. The LCM layers are thin-film deposited and individually addressable.
*   **Cavity Geometry:** Rectangular cuboid (similar to the provided patent), but with transparent windows incorporated into the side walls to allow for light-based LCM control. Cavity dimensions are critical and require high-precision machining. Target dimensions: 5mm x 3mm x 10mm (adjustable based on target frequency).
*   **Polarization Control:** Each cavity includes a micro-LED array positioned outside the transparent window, emitting polarized light (adjustable polarization angle). The light interacts with the LCM, altering its refractive index, effectively changing the cavity's effective dielectric constant and thus its resonant frequency.
*   **Inter-Cavity Coupling:** Similar slot coupling as the reference patent, but the slot geometry is optimized for polarization-dependent coupling. Slots are not uniformly sized or positioned; variation is intentional.
*   **Control System:** A microcontroller monitors the input signal and adjusts the polarization of each micro-LED array individually. This creates a 'gradient' of resonant frequencies across the filter, optimizing performance for specific signal characteristics. An algorithm dynamically maps input signal frequency/amplitude to polarization states.
*   **Housing:** Aluminum housing with integrated heat sinks for the micro-LED arrays.
*   **Input/Output:** Waveguide compatible connectors.

**Operation:**

1.  The incoming RF signal excites the first cavity.
2.  The microcontroller analyzes the input signalâ€™s frequency and amplitude.
3.  Based on the analysis, the microcontroller adjusts the polarization of the micro-LED array for each cavity, altering its resonant frequency.
4.  RF energy couples between cavities via the slots. Polarization-dependent coupling alters the signal transmission characteristics.
5.  The filtered RF signal is output from the final cavity.

**Pseudocode (Microcontroller):**

```
// Define cavity array
Cavity cavities[N];

// Function to analyze input signal
Signal analyzeInput(RFSignal input) {
  // Perform FFT to determine frequency components
  frequency = FFT(input);
  // Measure amplitude of dominant frequency
  amplitude = measureAmplitude(frequency);
  return Signal(frequency, amplitude);
}

// Function to calculate polarization angle
float calculatePolarizationAngle(float frequency) {
  // Apply mapping function to frequency to determine optimal angle
  angle =  (frequency - minFrequency) / (maxFrequency - minFrequency) * 180;
  return angle;
}

// Main Loop
void mainLoop() {
  Signal inputSignal = analyzeInput(getInputSignal());
  float frequency = inputSignal.frequency;
  float polarizationAngle = calculatePolarizationAngle(frequency);

  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    cavities[i].setPolarizationAngle(polarizationAngle);
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This design moves beyond static filter characteristics by introducing *active* frequency control. The use of tunable polarization within each cavity enables dynamic filtering, adapting to changing signal conditions. This can lead to improved signal selectivity, reduced interference, and enhanced performance in dynamic RF environments. The algorithm can be expanded to include machine learning in order to predict the ideal filtering parameters.
