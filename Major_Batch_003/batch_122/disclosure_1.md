## Dynamic Media Stream Stitching with Predictive Handover

**Concept:** Extend the server-to-server handover by proactively predicting potential server instability *before* it’s detected, and pre-stitching media segments onto a 'standby' server. This minimizes, and potentially eliminates, interruption during handover.

**Specifications:**

**1. Prediction Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Server health metrics (CPU load, memory usage, network latency, disk I/O).
    *   Historical server failure data.
    *   Real-time network condition monitoring (packet loss, jitter).
    *   Geographic proximity of servers & clients.
    *   Scheduled maintenance windows.
*   **Algorithm:** Implement a weighted scoring system. Each metric contributes to a 'Stability Score'. A Machine Learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) continuously trains on historical data to optimize the weighting.  Thresholds are dynamically adjusted based on real-time conditions.  (Pseudocode):

```
StabilityScore = w1 * CPU_Load + w2 * Memory_Usage + w3 * Network_Latency + w4 * Historical_Failures + w5 * Scheduled_Maintenance
IF StabilityScore < Threshold THEN
    Initiate Predictive Handover()
ENDIF
```

**2. Pre-Stitching Module:**

*   **Segment Granularity:**  Media stream divided into small segments (e.g., 200ms – 500ms).
*   **Redundancy:**  Maintain a ‘buffer’ of the *last N* segments on both the primary and secondary servers. *N* is configurable.
*   **Parallel Encoding/Transcoding:** Pre-encode/transcode segments onto the standby server in real-time, matching the format of the primary server. This eliminates encoding delays during handover.
*   **Segment Validation:** Implement a checksum/hash mechanism to ensure segment integrity on both servers.

**3. Handover Procedure:**

1.  **Prediction Trigger:** Prediction Engine detects impending instability.
2.  **Standby Activation:** Standby server is signaled to prepare for handover.
3.  **Pre-Stitch Completion:** Ensure all segments in the buffer are successfully pre-stitched on the standby server.
4.  **Client Notification:** Client receives a notification *before* the primary server goes offline, including updated server address.
5.  **Seamless Switch:** Client seamlessly switches to the standby server. Data transmission continues from the pre-stitched segments.
6.  **Primary Server Shutdown:** Primary server gracefully shuts down.
7.  **Buffer Synchronization:** The standby server becomes the new primary. The buffer is continuously updated.

**4. Client SDK:**

*   **Proactive Server Polling:** Client SDK periodically polls the server for health status.
*   **Adaptive Buffering:** Adjust buffering levels based on network conditions and server stability.
*   **Segment Request Optimization:** Request segments from the primary server unless a handover is in progress.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected disconnections or errors.

**5. Monitoring and Analytics:**

*   **Real-time Server Health Dashboard:** Display server health metrics, stability scores, and handover events.
*   **Handover Performance Reporting:** Track handover frequency, duration, and success rate.
*   **Predictive Model Training:** Continuously retrain the predictive model with new data to improve accuracy.
