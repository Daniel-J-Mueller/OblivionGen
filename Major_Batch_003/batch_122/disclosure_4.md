## Adaptive Proactive Social Threading

**Concept:** Extend the existing social fallback mechanism to *proactively* identify and pre-populate potential social threads based on predicted user intents *before* the user explicitly requests assistance. This shifts from reactive fallback to anticipatory support, potentially increasing user engagement and resolving issues faster.

**Specs:**

**1. Intent Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** User activity stream (text, audio, app usage, location, calendar events, etc.).
*   **Processing:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on historical user data to predict the user’s likely intent over a short time horizon (e.g., next 5-15 minutes). Output a probability distribution over potential intents.  Example: `{"intent": "book flight", "probability": 0.75}`, `{"intent": "find restaurant", "probability": 0.60}`, `{"intent": "check weather", "probability": 0.45}`.
*   **Output:** Ranked list of predicted intents with associated probabilities.

**2. Social Thread Pre-population Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Ranked list of predicted intents (from Intent Prediction Module) and user's social graph.
*   **Processing:**
    *   For each predicted intent, identify potential "Social Experts" – users within the social graph who are demonstrably knowledgeable or frequently involved in discussions related to that intent. This utilizes a weighted scoring system:
        *   **Content Relevance Score:**  Based on the similarity between the user's current context (e.g., search query, app content) and the content shared/created by potential Social Experts. Utilize cosine similarity on embedded text representations.
        *   **Engagement Score:** Measures the level of interaction (likes, comments, shares) received by the Social Expert’s content related to the intent.
        *   **Reciprocity Score:**  Accounts for the history of mutual assistance between the user and the Social Expert.
    *   Create a “Social Thread Preview” for each top-ranked Social Expert. This preview includes:
        *   Social Expert’s profile information.
        *   A short summary of their expertise related to the predicted intent.
        *   A pre-populated message starter tailored to the predicted intent (e.g., “Hey [Expert Name], I'm planning a trip to [Location].  You seem to know a lot about the area.  Any recommendations?”).
*   **Output:** A ranked list of Social Thread Previews, displayed to the user in a non-intrusive manner (e.g., a carousel at the bottom of the screen, a proactive suggestion in a virtual assistant interface).

**3. Dynamic Adjustment & Feedback Loop:**

*   **Input:** User interactions with Social Thread Previews (e.g., clicking on a preview, starting a conversation, ignoring a suggestion).
*   **Processing:**  Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to refine the prediction model and Social Expert ranking.  The RL agent receives rewards for positive user interactions and penalties for negative ones.
*   **Output:** Updated prediction model and Social Expert ranking, leading to more accurate and relevant Social Thread Previews over time.



**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (User Active) {
    predicted_intents = IntentPredictionModule(user_activity_stream)
    for (intent in predicted_intents) {
        social_experts = IdentifySocialExperts(intent, user_social_graph)
        social_thread_previews = CreateSocialThreadPreviews(social_experts, intent)
        DisplaySocialThreadPreviews(social_thread_previews)
        user_interaction = GetUserInteraction()
        if (user_interaction != null) {
            ReinforcementLearningAgent.Update(user_interaction)
        }
    }
}

// IdentifySocialExperts(intent, user_social_graph)
//   -> Returns a list of Social Expert user IDs.
//   Calculates Content Relevance, Engagement, and Reciprocity scores.

// CreateSocialThreadPreviews(social_experts, intent)
//   -> Returns a list of Social Thread Preview objects.
//   Includes user profile, expertise summary, and pre-populated message starter.
