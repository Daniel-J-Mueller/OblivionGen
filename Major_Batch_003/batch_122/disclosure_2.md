## Adaptive Emotional Layering for Voice Synthesis

**Concept:** Expand beyond single mood-based voice models to allow for dynamic emotional shifts *within* a single utterance. This builds on the patent’s mood selection, but introduces a layered approach to emotional expression, allowing for nuance and complexity.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Components:**

1.  **Emotional Primitives Library:** A database of fundamental emotional "primitives" (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, neutrality). Each primitive is represented as a set of acoustic features – prosody, timbre, spectral characteristics – distilled from a large corpus of emotive speech. These are *not* full voices, but building blocks.
2.  **Emotional Scripting Language (ESL):** A text-based language to annotate scripts with temporal emotional cues. ESL tags indicate the *intensity* and *duration* of each emotional primitive applied to specific words or phrases. Example: `[joy:0.7:2s]Hello[sad:0.3:1s] world[neutral]!`. This indicates “Hello” is spoken with 70% joy intensity for 2 seconds, transitioning to 30% sadness for 1 second, then neutral.
3.  **Emotional Blending Engine:** This module takes the base voice model (as in the patent) and the ESL-annotated script as input. It blends the acoustic features of the selected emotional primitives with the base voice model’s features in real-time, creating a dynamically emotive output. The blending is weighted based on the ESL intensity and duration values.
4.  **Real-Time Emotion Adjustment Interface:**  A visual interface for the posting user to interactively adjust the emotional parameters (intensity, duration, blending weights) of the generated speech. This allows for fine-tuning the emotional delivery of the content.

**II. System Architecture:**

1.  **Input:** Text script with optional ESL annotations.
2.  **Processing:**
    *   Script Parser: Parses the script, identifying text and ESL tags.
    *   Voice Model Selection: Selects the base voice model (as per patent).
    *   Emotional Decomposition: Breaks down the ESL tags into acoustic feature adjustments.
    *   Feature Blending:  Combines base voice features with emotional primitive features.
    *   Audio Synthesis: Generates the synthetic audio stream.
3.  **Output:** Dynamically emotive audio stream.

**III. Pseudocode (Feature Blending):**

```
function blendFeatures(baseFeatures, emotionFeatures, intensity):
  blendedFeatures = {}
  for feature in baseFeatures:
    blendedFeatures[feature] = baseFeatures[feature] * (1 - intensity) + emotionFeatures[feature] * intensity
  return blendedFeatures

function synthesizeAudio(script, baseVoiceModel, emotionPrimitives):
  audioSegments = []
  currentSegmentStart = 0
  for i in range(len(script)):
    if script[i] is ESLTag:
      intensity = ESLTag.intensity
      duration = ESLTag.duration
      emotionFeatures = emotionPrimitives[ESLTag.emotion]
      # Blend features for duration
      for j in range(int(duration * sampleRate)):
        blendedFeatures = blendFeatures(baseVoiceModel.features, emotionFeatures, intensity)
        audioSegment = synthesizeSample(blendedFeatures)
        audioSegments.append(audioSegment)
    else:
      # No emotion tag, use base voice model
      audioSegment = synthesizeSample(baseVoiceModel.features)
      audioSegments.append(audioSegment)
  return concatenateAudioSegments(audioSegments)
```

**IV. User Interface Elements:**

*   **Timeline Editor:** Visual representation of the script with emotional tags displayed on a timeline.
*   **Emotion Palette:** Selection of core emotional primitives.
*   **Parameter Sliders:** Control intensity, duration, and blending weights for each emotion.
*   **Real-Time Playback:**  Audible preview of the generated speech with applied emotions.
*   **A/B Comparison:** Switch between original and emotionally enhanced audio.
