**Dynamic Attribute Weighting & Predictive Connection Strength**

**Concept:** Extend the existing attribute-based discovery system with a dynamic weighting system for user attributes, coupled with a predictive ‘connection strength’ score. This moves beyond simple attribute matching to predict the *quality* of potential connections.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Collection Module:**
    *   Continuously monitor user interactions (likes, comments, shares, messaging frequency, co-membership in communities) *with other users who also participate in the discovery service*.
    *   Track the *duration* of interactions – sustained engagement is weighted higher.
    *   Analyze content shared/engaged with – identify thematic overlap beyond explicitly stated attributes.
*   **Attribute Weighting Engine:**
    *   Assign initial weights to each attribute (e.g., hobbies, interests, values).
    *   Dynamically adjust weights based on the collected interaction data.  If users frequently engage with others *despite* lacking a shared attribute, that attribute’s weight decreases for that user. Conversely, consistently strong engagement with users sharing a specific attribute increases that attribute’s weight.
    *   Employ a decay function to reduce the influence of older interactions.
*   **Connection Strength Algorithm:**
    *   Calculate a ‘Connection Strength’ score for each potential connection.
    *   Score = Σ (AttributeWeight<sub>i</sub> \* AttributeMatch<sub>i</sub>) + InteractionBonus
    *   AttributeWeight<sub>i</sub>: Dynamically adjusted weight for attribute *i*.
    *   AttributeMatch<sub>i</sub>: Binary (0/1) indicating whether both users share attribute *i*. Could be extended to a scaled value reflecting the *degree* of overlap.
    *   InteractionBonus: Calculated based on prior interactions between the user and the potential connection’s network (e.g., mutual friends, shared group activity).
*   **User Interface Integration:**
    *   Display a ‘Connection Strength’ indicator alongside potential connections within the discovery service interface.
    *   Allow users to filter/sort potential connections by Connection Strength.
    *   Provide transparency – allow users to view the key attributes contributing to their Connection Strength score (without revealing the weighting algorithm itself).
    *   Introduce ‘Connection Forecast’ - a prediction of likely interaction frequency based on historical data and Connection Strength.

**Pseudocode (Connection Strength Calculation):**

```
function calculateConnectionStrength(userA, userB, attributeWeights) {
  strength = 0;
  for each attribute in userA.attributes and userB.attributes {
    if (userA.hasAttribute(attribute) && userB.hasAttribute(attribute)) {
      strength += attributeWeights[attribute];
    }
  }

  // Interaction Bonus (example)
  mutualFriends = findMutualFriends(userA, userB);
  interactionBonus = mutualFriends.length * 0.5; // Scale appropriately

  strength += interactionBonus;
  return strength;
}
```

**Novelty:** The combination of dynamic attribute weighting *and* interaction-based bonus within a predictive connection strength algorithm represents a significant advancement beyond static attribute matching. This moves the discovery service from a simple filter to a more intelligent and personalized connection engine.
