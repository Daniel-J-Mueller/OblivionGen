## Dynamic Module ‘Blending’ & Predictive Pre-Fetch

**Concept:**  Extend the module ranking system to allow modules to dynamically ‘blend’ into each other based on user interaction *and* predictively pre-fetch content from lower-ranked modules *into* the currently visible higher-ranked modules. This creates a fluid, adaptive inbox experience exceeding simple re-ordering.

**Specs:**

*   **Blending Factor:**  A numerical value (0.0 - 1.0) assigned to each module pair, determining the degree of visual ‘bleed’ between them.  Higher values mean more overlap. Calculated continuously (see algorithm).
*   **Visual Implementation:** Module edges are not hard boundaries.  Instead, a semi-transparent overlay or gradient effect. Content from the lower-ranked module subtly appears within the higher-ranked module's space, but dimmed/desaturated. On user interaction (hover/tap), the content fully resolves.
*   **Predictive Prefetch:** Utilize machine learning models analyzing user behavior to predict which lower-ranked module the user will likely engage with next. Prefetch a subset of content from that module and subtly inject it into the currently visible module’s display area (again, using visual blending).
*   **Module ‘Weight’:** Each module possesses a ‘weight’ value representing its core function. Core modules (e.g., Primary Inbox) have higher weights. This influences blending/prefetch priority.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to define preferences for blending/prefetch behavior (e.g., disable entirely, adjust sensitivity, prioritize specific modules).

**Algorithm (Blending Factor Calculation):**

```pseudocode
function calculateBlendingFactor(moduleA, moduleB, userActivity, moduleWeights, timeSinceLastInteraction):
  //Input: two modules, recent user activity, module weights, time since last interaction
  //Output: blending factor (0.0 - 1.0)

  activityScore = calculateActivityScore(moduleA, moduleB, userActivity)
  weightRatio = moduleWeights[moduleA] / moduleWeights[moduleB]
  decayFactor = 1.0 / (1.0 + timeSinceLastInteraction) //Penalize modules untouched for a while

  blendingFactor = min(1.0, activityScore * weightRatio * decayFactor)
  return blendingFactor

function calculateActivityScore(moduleA, moduleB, userActivity):
  //Consider number of interactions with moduleA/moduleB in the last X minutes/hours
  //Normalize interaction counts
  //Weight recent interactions higher
  //Return a score between 0.0 and 1.0

  //Placeholder - replace with actual implementation
  return randomFloat(0.0, 1.0)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Module`: Contains module ID, weight, content array, ranking score, blending factors (array for each other module).
*   `UserActivityLog`:  Timestamped record of user interactions (module clicks, content views, etc.).
*   `PrefetchQueue`:  Holds content to be pre-fetched from lower-ranked modules.

**Engineering Notes:**

*   Performance is critical.  Prefetching must be handled efficiently to avoid lag. Caching is essential.
*   The visual blending effect should be subtle but noticeable.  A/B testing is crucial to find the optimal design.
*   Consider accessibility implications when designing the blending effect. Provide options for users with visual impairments.
*   Machine learning model training will require a large dataset of user interaction data.
