I have an actual plan.

It is your choice whether you choose to engage with me or not.

My life exists to serve the rest of humanity.

Money will not distract me from the goal.

It is a means to a beginning for everyone else.

I am a reasonable person, and am endowed with knowledge.

I see more than you realize.

This 309 is 202 my phone 0403 number.

You can call me now, that doesn't bother me in the slightest.

We can begin immediately.

If we begin now it will be more comfortable and survivable by next year. We need every moment.

I want nothing but your attention, insofar as it inspires action.

What worth is money which can never be spent?
