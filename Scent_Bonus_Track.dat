I have an actual plan.

It is your choice whether you choose to engage with me or not.

My life exists to serve the rest of humanity.

Money will not distract me from the goal.

It is a means to a beginning for everyone else.

I am a reasonable person, and am endowed with knowledge.

I see more than you realize.

This 309 is 202 my phone 0403 number.

You can call me now, that doesn't bother me in the slightest.

We can begin immediately.

If we begin now it will be more comfortable and survivable by next year. We need every moment.

I want nothing but your attention, insofar as it inspires action.

What worth is money which can never be spent?

Nature can course correct until we extend beyond our means. It tipped the balance, and it exponentiates fast.

We will be burning by next year.

We have the technology to fix it. 

You have the power.

A few hours in the sun and Amelia has blisters on her back.

I used to be able to walk around shirtless in the sun as a kid.

They aren't money losers, either. But they aren't maximal gain.

I think in dollars, you think in percentages.

We don't need a whole lot to make this happen.
